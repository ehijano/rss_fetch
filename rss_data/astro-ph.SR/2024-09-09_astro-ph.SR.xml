      <title>TIC 435850195: The Second Tri-Axial, Tidally Tilted Pulsator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has enabled the discovery of numerous tidally tilted pulsators (TTPs), which are pulsating stars in close binaries where the presence of a tidal bulge has the effect of tilting the primary star's pulsation axes into the orbital plane. Recently, the modeling framework developed to analyze TTPs has been applied to the emerging class of tri-axial pulsators, which exhibit nonradial pulsations about three perpendicular axes. In this work, we report on the identification of the second-ever discovered tri-axial pulsator, with sixteen robustly-detected pulsation multiplets, of which fourteen are dipole doublets separated by 2$\nu_{\rm orb}$. We jointly fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) and TESS light curve of the star, and find that the primary is slightly evolved off the zero-age main sequence, while the less massive secondary still lies on the zero-age main sequence. Of the fourteen doublets, we associate eight with $Y_{10x}$ modes and six with novel $Y_{10y}$ modes. We exclude the existence of $Y_{11x}$ modes in this star and show that the observed pulsation modes must be $Y_{10y}$. We also present a toy model for the tri-axial pulsation framework in the context of this star. The techniques presented here can be utilized to rapidly analyze and confirm future tri-axial pulsator candidates.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Early Luminosity History of the Sun: Applications to the Faint Young Sun Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar evolution theory predicts that the Sun was fainter in the past, which can pose difficulties for understanding Earth's climate history. One proposed solution to this Faint Young Sun problem is a more luminous Sun in the past. In this paper, we address the robustness of the solar luminosity history using the YREC code to compute solar models including rotation, magnetized winds, and the associated mass loss. We present detailed solar models, including their evolutionary history, which are in excellent agreement with solar observables. Consistent with prior standard models, we infer a high solar metal content. We provide predicted X-ray luminosities and rotation histories for usage in climate reconstructions and activity studies. We find that the Sun's luminosity deviates from the standard solar model trajectory by at most 0.5% during the Archean (corresponding to a radiative forcing of 0.849 W m$^{-2}$). The total mass loss experienced by solar models is modest because of strong feedback between mass and angular momentum loss. We find a maximum mass loss of $1.35 \times 10^{-3} M_\odot$ since birth, at or below the level predicted by empirical estimates. The associated maximum luminosity increase falls well short of the level necessary to solve the FYS problem. We present compilations of paleotemperature and CO$_2$ reconstructions. 1-D "inverse" climate models demonstrate a mismatch between the solar constant needed to reach high temperatures (e.g. 60-80 $^{\circ}$C) and the narrow range of plausible solar luminosities determined in this study. Maintaining a temperate Earth, however, is plausible given these conditions.</description>

      <title>BH-BH mergers with &amp; without EM counterpart: A model for stable tertiary mass transfer in hierarchical triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple stars are prevalent within the population of observed stars. Their evolution, compared to binaries, is notably more complex, influenced by unique dynamical, tidal, and mass transfer processes. Understanding these phenomena is essential for a comprehensive insight into multistar evolution and the formation of energetic transients, including gravitational-wave mergers. Our study probes the evolution of triple star systems when the tertiary fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to the inner binary, potentially forming GW sources with distinct properties. We develop an analytical model for hierarchical triples undergoing stable mass transfer from the tertiary. Using population synthesis simulations, we investigate triples with a Roche-lobe filling tertiary and an inner binary black hole. These systems originate from inner binaries undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution. Our analysis includes populations with metallicities of Z=0.005 and Z=0.0005, focusing on primary components with initial masses of 20 to 100 M_sun, and inner and outer orbital separations up to 40 R_sun and 10^5 R_sun, respectively. Our results show that mass transfer predominantly leads to orbital shrinkage of the inner binary, non-zero eccentricities, and expansion of the outer orbit. Among systems with CHE inner binaries, 9.5% result in mass transfer from the tertiary onto an inner BBH. We predict high formation efficiency of GW mergers, ranging from 85.1% to 100% at Z=0.005 and 100% at Z=0.0005, with short delay times. Local merger rates are projected to be between 0.69 to 1.74 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. A fraction of these BBH mergers, entering the LISA and aLIGO frequency bands, may still be accreting gas, potentially producing a strong electromagnetic counterpart. EM signals vary significantly based on model assumptions, ranging from less than 0.03% to 46.8% of all mergers if circumbinary disk formation is allowed.</description>

      <title>An analysis of spectroscopic, seismological, astrometric, and photometric masses of pulsating white dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in the field of stellar astrophysics lies in accurately determining the mass of isolated stars. However, for pulsating white dwarf (WD) stars, the task becomes more tractable due to the availability of multiple approaches such as spectroscopy, asteroseismology, astrometry, and photometry. The objective of this work is to compare the asteroseismological and spectroscopic mass values of WDs in detail and, in turn, to compare them with the masses derived using astrometric parallaxes/distances and photometry. Our analysis encompasses a selection of pulsating WDs with different surface chemical abundances that define the main classes of variable WDs. We calculated their spectroscopic masses, compiled seismological masses, and determined astrometric masses. We also derived photometric masses, when possible. Subsequently, we compared all the sets of stellar masses obtained through these different methods. To ensure consistency and robustness in our comparisons, we used identical WD models and evolutionary tracks across all four methods. The analysis suggests a general consensus among the these methods regarding the masses of pulsating WD with H-rich atmospheres, known as DAV or ZZ Ceti stars, especially for objects with masses below approximately $0.75 M_{\sun}$, although notable disparities emerge for certain massive stars. For pulsating WD stars with He-rich atmospheres, called DBV or V777 Her stars, we find that astrometric masses generally exceed seismological, spectroscopic, and photometric masses. Finally, while there is agreement among the sets of stellar masses for pulsating WDs with C-, O-, and He-rich atmospheres (designated as GW Vir stars), outliers exist where mass determinations by various methods show significant discrepancies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides an in-depth overview of white dwarfs, the evolutionary terminus of the vast majority of stars. It discusses their discovery, their nature as degenerate objects, their connections to earlier phases of stellar evolution, their subsequent evolution as they gradually cool down, the varied physical conditions from their dense cores to their tenuous atmospheres, some key statistics about the properties of the ever expanding population of known white dwarfs, the diversity of their spectra, the accretion of planetary material, and the presence of magnetic fields. The chapter also highlights the instrumental role of white dwarfs in other areas of astronomy.</description>

      <title>A hybrid approach to generating diatomic line lists for high resolution studies of exoplanets and other hot astronomical objects: Updates to ExoMol MgO, TiO and VO line lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The best molecular line lists for astrophysical applications today require both high accuracy of line positions for strong lines as well as high overall completeness. The former is required to enable, for example, molecular detection in high-resolution cross-correlation observations of exoplanets, while completeness is required for accurate spectroscopic and radiative properties over broad temperature and spectral ranges. The use of empirical energies generated with the Marvel procedure is a standard way to improve accuracy; here we explore methods of extending the use of these levels using predicted shifts and isotopologue extrapolation, as well augmenting the levels from other sources such as effective Hamiltonian studies. These methods are used to update ExoMol line lists for the main 24Mg16O and 48Ti16O isotopologues, as well as for 24Mg17O, 24Mg18O, 25Mg16O, 26Mg16O, 46Ti16O, 47Ti16O, 49Ti16O and 50Ti16O; new Marvel results for 51V16O are also presented</description>

      <title>Automated detection of exploding granules with SDO/HMI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploding granules on the solar surface play a major role in the dynamics of the outer part of the convection zone, especially in the diffusion of magnetic field. We aimed at developing an automated procedure able to investigate the location and evolution of exploding granules over the solar surface and to get rid of visual detection. We used sequences of observations of intensity and Doppler velocity, as well as magnetograms, provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The automated detection of the exploding granules is performed by applying criteria on either three or two parameters: the granule area, the amplitude of the velocity field divergence, and, at the disc centre, the radial Doppler velocity. Our analyses showed that granule area and divergence amplitudes are sufficient to detect the largest exploding granules, we thus can automatically detect them, not only at the disc centre, but on the whole solar surface. Using a 24-hour-long observation sequence, we demonstrated the important contribution of the most dynamic exploding granules in the diffusion of the magnetic field in the quiet Sun. Indeed, we showed that the most intense exploding granules are sufficient to build a large part of the photospheric network. We also applied our procedure on Hinode observations to locate the exploding granules relative to Tree of Fragmenting Granules (TFG). We concluded that, during a first phase of about 300 minutes after the birth of a TFG, exploding granules are preferentially located on its edge. Finally, we also showed that the distribution of exploding granules is homogeneous (at the level of our measurement errors) over the solar surface without significant dependency with latitude.</description>

      <title>Solar Inertial Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun's global inertial modes are very sensitive to the solar differential rotation and to properties of the deep solar convection zone which are currently poorly constrained. These properties include the superadiabatic temperature gradient, the latitudinal entropy gradient, and the turbulent viscosity. The inertial modes also play a key role in controlling the Sun's large-scale structure and dynamics, in particular the solar differential rotation. This paper summarizes recent observations and advances in the (linear and nonlinear) modeling of the solar inertial modes.</description>

      <title>Modelling of eclipsing binary systems with pulsating components and tertiary companions: BF Vel and RR Lep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of RR Lep and BF Vel, two short-period semi-detached oscillating Algols (oEA stars), which are shown to be triple systems. Spectral types of their primaries were determined and radial velocities calculated from spectra observed with the Australian National University's 2.3 m telescope and Wide Field Spectrograph. Spectra of the Na I D doublet confirmed the presence of tertiary components which were apparent in the broadening function analyses and, with H_a spectra during primary eclipses, indicated chromospherical activity in their secondaries. Ground-based telescopes were used for observations in several pass bands for photometric analyses. These data were complemented by data from the TESS mission to enable the modelling of the light curves, followed by a detailed analysis of pulsations. Eclipse-timing variation (ETV) analyses of both systems were used to determine the most likely mechanisms modulating the orbital period. We found mass values M1 = 2.9 M_sun and M2 = 0.75 M_sun for the components of RR Lep, and M1 = 1.93 M_sun and M2 = 0.97 M_sun for those of BF Vel. By integrating information from photometry, spectroscopy and ETV analysis, we found that tertiary components revolve around both systems. The primary star of RR Lep pulsates in 36 frequencies, of which five were identified as independent modes, with the dominant one being 32.28 d^-1. The pulsating component of BF Vel oscillates in 37 frequencies, with the frequency 46.73 d^-1 revealed as the only independent mode. For both systems, many frequencies were found to be related to the orbital frequency. Their physical properties were compared with other oEA stars in Mass-Radius and H-R diagrams, and the pulsational properties of their delta Sct components were compared with currently known systems of this type within the orbital-pulsation period and logg-pulsation period diagrams.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Sequence of Phases Leading to the Formation of the Active Region 13664, with Potential Carrington-like Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several recurrent X-class flares from Active Region (AR) 13664 have triggered a severe G5-class geomagnetic storm between May 10 and 11, 2024. The morphology and compactness of this AR closely resemble the active region responsible for the famous Carrington Event of 1859. Although the induced geomagnetic currents produced a value of the Dst index, probably, an order of magnitude weaker than that of the Carrington Event, the characteristics of AR 13664 warrant special attention. Understanding the mechanisms of magnetic field emergence and transformation in the solar atmosphere that lead to the formation of such an extensive, compact and complex AR is crucial. Our analysis of the emerging flux and horizontal motions of the magnetic structures observed in the photosphere reveals the fundamental role of a sequence of emerging bipoles at the same latitude and longitude, followed by converging and shear motions. This temporal order of processes frequently invoked in magnetohydrodynamic models - emergence, converging motions, and shear motions - is critical for the storage of magnetic energy preceding strong solar eruptions that, under the right timing, location and direction conditions, can trigger severe space weather events at Earth.</description>

      <title>Buoyant crystals halt the cooling of white dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs are stellar remnants devoid of a nuclear energy source, gradually cooling over billions of years and eventually freezing into a solid state from the inside out. Recently, it was discovered that a population of freezing white dwarfs maintains a constant luminosity for a duration comparable to the age of the universe, signaling the presence of a powerful yet unknown energy source that inhibits the cooling. For certain core compositions, the freezing process is predicted to trigger a solid-liquid distillation mechanism, due to the solid phase being depleted in heavy impurities. The crystals thus formed are buoyant and float up, thereby displacing heavier liquid downward and releasing gravitational energy. Here we show that distillation interrupts the cooling for billions of years and explains all the observational properties of the unusual delayed population. With a steady luminosity surpassing that of some main-sequence stars, these white dwarfs defy their conventional portrayal as dead stars. Our results highlight the existence of peculiar merger remnants and have profound implications for the use of white dwarfs in dating stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Biases in Exoplanet Transmission Spectra Introduced by Limb Darkening Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main endeavors of the field of exoplanetary sciences is the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres on a population level. The current method of choice to accomplish this task is transmission spectroscopy, where the apparent radius of a transiting exoplanet is measured at multiple wavelengths in search of atomic and molecular absorption features produced by the upper atmosphere constituents. To extract the planetary radius from a transit light curve, it is necessary to account for the decrease in luminosity away from the center of the projected stellar disk, known as the limb darkening. Physically-motivated parametrizations of the limb darkening, in particular of the quadratic form, are commonly used in exoplanet transit light-curve fitting. Here, we show that such parametrizations can introduce significant wavelength-dependent biases in the transmission spectra currently obtained with all instrument modes of the JWST, and thus have the potential to affect atmospheric inferences. To avoid such biases, we recommend the use of standard limb-darkening parametrizations with wide uninformative priors that allow for non-physical stellar intensity profiles in the transit fits, and thus for a complete and symmetrical exploration of the parameter space. We further find that fitting the light curves at the native resolution results in errors on the measured transit depths that are significantly smaller compared to light curves that are binned in wavelength before fitting, thus potentially maximizing the amount of information that can be extracted from the data.</description>

      <title>A 3D view of multiple populations kinematics in Galactic globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first 3D kinematic analysis of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in a representative sample of 16 Galactic globular clusters (GCs). For each GC in the sample we studied the MP line-of-sight, plane-of-the-sky and 3D rotation as well as the velocity distribution anisotropy. The differences between first- (FP) and second-population (SP) kinematic patterns were constrained by means of parameters specifically defined to provide a global measure of the relevant physical quantities and to enable a meaningful comparison among different clusters. Our analysis provides the first observational description of the MP kinematic properties and of the path they follow during the long-term dynamical evolution. In particular, we find evidence of differences between the rotation of MPs along all velocity components with the SP preferentially rotating faster than the FP. The difference between the rotation strength of MPs is anti-correlated with the cluster dynamical age. We observe also that FPs are characterized by isotropic velocity distributions at any dynamical age probed by our sample. On the contrary, the velocity distribution of SP stars is found to be radially anisotropic in dynamically young clusters and isotropic at later evolutionary stages. The comparison with a set of numerical simulations shows that these observational results are consistent with the long-term evolution of clusters forming with an initially more centrally concentrated and more rapidly rotating SP subsystem. We discuss the possible implications these findings have on our understanding of MP formation and early evolution.</description>

      <title>Measuring the $\mathrm{^{34}S}$ and $\mathrm{^{33}S}$ isotopic ratios of volatile sulfur during planet formation</title>

Abstract: Stable isotopic ratios constitute powerful tools for unraveling the thermal and irradiation history of volatiles. In particular, we can use our knowledge of the isotopic fractionation processes active during the various stages of star, disk and planet formation to infer the origins of different volatiles with measured isotopic patterns in our own solar system. Observations of planet-forming disks with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) now readily detect the heavier isotopologues of C, O and N, while the isotopologue abundances and isotopic fractionation mechanisms of sulfur species are less well understood. Using ALMA observations of the SO and SO2 isotopologues in the nearby, molecule-rich disk around the young star Oph-IRS 48 we present the first constraints on the combined 32S/34S and 32S/33S isotope ratios in a planet-forming disk. Given that these isotopologues likely originate in relatively warm gas (&gt;50 K), like most other Oph-IRS 48 volatiles, SO is depleted in heavy sulfur while SO2 is enriched compared to solar system values. However, we cannot completely rule out a cooler gas reservoir, which would put the SO sulfur ratios more in line with comets and other solar system bodies. We also constrain the S18O/SO ratio and find the limit to be consistent with solar system values given a temperature of 60 K. Together these observations show that we should not assume solar isotopic values for disk sulfur reservoirs, but additional observations are needed to determine the chemical origin of the abundant SO in this disk, inform on what isotopic fractionation mechanism(s) are at play, and aid in unravelling the history of the sulfur budget during the different stages of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Progress report on the BEBOP search for circumbinary planets with radial velocities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BEBOP (Binaries Escorted By Orbiting Planets) survey is a search for circumbinary planets using the radial velocity spectrographs HARPS and SOPHIE, currently focusing on single-lined binaries with a mass ratio $&lt;0.3$. Circumbinary systems are an important testing ground for planet formation theories as the dynamically complex influence of the binary makes planet formation and survival more difficult. Here we present the results of the survey so far including: confirmed planets such as BEBOP-1c the first circumbinary planet detected in radial velocity; the status of our observations; and preliminary occurrence rates. We compare the early results of the radial velocity survey to the population of circumbinary planets discovered in transit, and suggest that there may be a population of inflated planets close to the inner binary which are detectable in transit but more difficult in radial velocity. Using time-lag tidal theory, we show that this inflation is unlikely caused by tides.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Distribution of $\rm CH_4$ and $\rm CO_2$ Ice around Protostars IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin and evolution of organic molecules represent a pivotal issue in the fields of astrobiology and astrochemistry, potentially shedding light on the origins of life. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its exceptional sensitivity and spectral resolution, is well suitable to observe molecules such as methane ($\rm CH_4$). Our analysis focused on the distribution of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice and silicate absorption dips at approximately 7.7, 15.0, 6.0, 6.7 and 10.0 micrometres in two protostars: IRAS 16253-2429 and IRAS 23385+6053. We extract the $\rm CH_4$, $\rm CO_2$, $\rm H_2O$, $\rm{CH_3OH+NH_4^+}$ ice equivalent width (EW) maps and silicate extinction maps of the two sources. Our results reveal that the spatial distribution of $\rm CH_4$ in the protostellar system IRAS 16253-2429 closely mirrors that of its $\rm CO_2$ ice, forming a surrounded distribution that encircles the central protostar. This alignment suggests a common formation mechanism and subsequent trapping within the protostellar envelope, which is consistent with the "Classical" dark-cloud chemistry with ion-molecule reaction. In contrast, the spatial distributions of various molecules in the system IRAS 23385+6053 exhibit low similarities, which may be attributed to the dynamic influences of outflows or accretion processes. These discrepancies highlight the complex interplay between physical processes and chemical evolution in protostellar environments.</description>

      <title>An "alien" called Oosterhoff dichotomy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we investigate the origin of the Oosterhoff dichotomy, considering recent discoveries related to several ancient merging events of external galaxies with the Milky Way (MW). In particular, we aim to clarify if the subdivision in Oosterhoff type of Galactic Globular Clusters (GGCs) and field RR Lyrae (RRLs) could be traced back to one or more ancient galaxies that merged with the MW in its past. To this purpose, we first explored the association of GGCs with the past merging events according to different literature studies. Subsequently we compiled positions, proper motions and radial velocity for 10,138 field RRLs variables from the $Gaia$ Data Release 3. To infer the distances, we adopted the $M_G$--[Fe/H] relation, with [Fe/H] values estimated through empirical relationships involving the individual periods and Fourier parameters. We then calculated the orbits and the integrals of motions (IoM) using the Python library Galpy for the whole sample. By comparing the location of the field RRLs in the energy-angular momentum diagram with that of the GGCs we assign their likely origin. Finally, we discriminate from the $Gaia$ G-band light curves the Oosterhoff type of our sample of RRL stars based on their location in the Bailey diagram. The analysis of the Bailey diagrams for Galactic RRLs stars and GGCs associated with \textit{In-Situ} vs \textit{Accreted} halo origin shows remarkable differences. The \textit{In-Situ} sample displays a wide range of metallicities with a continuous distribution and no sign of Oosterhoff dichotomy. Conversely, the \textit{Accreted} RRLs clearly shows the Oosterhoff dichotomy and a significantly smaller dispersion in metallicity. Our results suggest that the Oosterhoff dichotomy was imported into the MW by the merging events that shaped the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The POKEMON Speckle Survey of Nearby M Dwarfs. III. The Stellar Multiplicity Rate of M Dwarfs within 15 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14703</link>

Abstract: M dwarfs are ubiquitous in our galaxy, and the rate at which they host stellar companions, and the properties of these companions, provides a window into the formation and evolution of the star(s), and of any planets that they may host. The Pervasive Overview of 'Kompanions' of Every M dwarf in Our Neighborhood (POKEMON) speckle survey of nearby M dwarfs is volume-limited from M0V through M9V out to 15 pc, with additional targets at larger distances. In total, 1125 stars were observed, and 455 of these are within the volume-limited, 15-pc sample of M-dwarf primaries. When we combine the speckle observations with known companions from the literature, we find that the stellar multiplicity rate of M dwarfs within 15 pc is 23.5% plus or minus 2.0%, and that the companion rate is 28.8% plus or minus 2.1%. We also find that the projected separation distribution for multiples that are known to host planets peaks at 198 au, while the distribution for multiples that are not yet known to host planets peaks at 5.57 au. This result suggests that the presence of close-in stellar companions inhibits the formation of M-dwarf planetary systems, similar to what has been found for FGK stars.</description>

      <title>Assembling algorithm for Green's tensors and absorbing boundary conditions for Galbrun's equation in radial symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar oscillations can be modeled by Galbrun's equation which describes Lagrangian wave displacement in a self-gravitating stratified medium. For spherically symmetric backgrounds, we construct an algorithm to compute efficiently and accurately the coefficients of the Green's tensor of the time-harmonic equation in vector spherical harmonic basis. With only two resolutions, our algorithm provides values of the kernels for all heights of source and receiver, and prescribes analytically the singularities of the kernels. We also derive absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) to model wave propagation in the atmosphere above the cut-off frequency. The construction of ABC, which contains varying gravity terms, is rendered difficult by the complex behavior of the solar potential in low atmosphere and for frequencies below the Lamb frequency. We carry out extensive numerical investigations to compare and evaluate the efficiency of the ABCs in capturing outgoing solutions. Finally, as an application towards helioseismology, we compute synthetic solar power spectra that contain pressure modes as well as internal-gravity (g-) and surface-gravity (f-) ridges which are missing in simpler approximations of the wave equation. For purpose of validation, the location of the ridges in the synthetic power spectra are compared with observed solar modes.</description>

Abstract: The diatomic metal monoxides whose optical spectra define the classification of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), that is, TiO, YO, ZrO, and LaO, have the unusual property that their ionization energy is below their dissociation limit. The cations of these metal monoxides can be efficiently produced via associative ionization of their constituent ground state atoms and are long-lived. We present a simple model that can explain the observed relative abundance of these metal oxides as a function of the C/O ratio.</description>

      <title>The solar beryllium abundance revisited with 3D non-LTE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present-day abundance of beryllium in the solar atmosphere provides clues about mixing mechanisms within stellar interiors. However, abundance determinations based on the Be II 313.107 nm line are prone to systematic errors due to imperfect model spectra. These errors arise from missing continuous opacity in the UV, a significant unidentified blend at 313.102 nm, departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and microturbulence and macroturbulence fudge parameters associated with one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic model atmospheres. Although these factors have been discussed in the literature, no study has yet accounted for all of them simultaneously. To address this, we present 3D non-LTE calculations for neutral and ionised beryllium in the Sun. We used these models to derive the present-day solar beryllium abundance, calibrating the missing opacity on high resolution solar irradiance data and the unidentified blend on the centre-to-limb variation. We find a surface abundance of 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 dex, which is significantly lower than the value of 1.38 dex that has been commonly adopted since 2004. Taking the initial abundance via CI chondrites, our result implies that beryllium has been depleted from the surface by an extra 0.11 $\pm$ 0.06 dex, or 22 $\pm$ 11%, on top of any effects of atomic diffusion. This is in tension with standard solar models, which predict negligible depletion, as well as with contemporary solar models that have extra mixing calibrated on the abundances of helium and lithium, which predict excessive depletion. These discrepancies highlight the need for further improvements to the physics in solar and stellar models.</description>

      <title>A Testbed for Tidal Migration: the 3D Architecture of an Eccentric Hot Jupiter HD 118203 b Accompanied by a Possibly Aligned Outer Giant Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing outer companions to hot Jupiters plays a crucial role in deciphering their origins. We present the discovery of a long-period giant planet, HD 118203 c ($m_{c}=11.79^{+0.69}_{-0.63}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{c}=6.28^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$ AU) exterior to a close-in eccentric hot Jupiter HD 118203 b ($P_{b}=6.135\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{b}=2.14\pm{0.12}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $r_{b}=1.14\pm{0.029}\ \mathrm{R_{J}}$, $e_{b}=0.31\pm{0.007}$) based on twenty-year radial velocities. Using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we measured a low sky-projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda_{b}=-11^{\circ}.7^{+7.6}_{-10.0}$ for HD 118203 b and detected stellar oscillations in the host star, confirming its evolved status. Combining the RM observation with the stellar inclination measurement, we constrained the true spin-orbit angle of HD 118203 b as $\Psi_{b}&lt;33^{\circ}.5\ (2\sigma)$, indicating the orbit normal of the hot Jupiter nearly aligned with the stellar spin axis. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we constrained the line-of-sight mutual inclination between the hot Jupiter and the outer planet to be $9^{\circ}.8^{+16.2}_{-9.3}$ at $2\sigma$ level. HD 118203 is one of first hot Jupiter systems where both the true spin-orbit angle of the hot Jupiter and the mutual inclination between inner and outer planets have been determined. Our results are consistent with a system-wide alignment, with low mutual inclinations between the outer giant planet, the inner hot Jupiter, and the host star. This alignment, along with the moderate eccentricity of HD 118203 c, implies that the system may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity tidal migration. Under this framework, our dynamical analysis suggests an initial semi-major axis of 0.3 to 3.2 AU for the proto-hot Jupiter.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. The authors now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>
