      <title>The D-equivalence conjecture for hyper-K\"ahler varieties via hyperholomorphic bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that birational hyper-K\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$-type are twisted derived equivalent with respect to some Brauer class. Furthermore, if a $K3^{[n]}$-type variety X admits a divisor class of divisibility 1 whose norm satisfies a congruence condition modulo 4, we show that any hyper-K\"ahler variety birational to X is derived equivalent to X. This verifies new cases of the D-equivalence conjecture in higher dimension. The Fourier-Mukai kernels of our (twisted) derived equivalences are constructed from Markman's projectively hyperholomorphic bundles.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties which describe the kinematic spaces of massless scattering (with or without dual conformal symmetry). Both are instances of partial flag varieties. We exhibit embeddings of the corresponding cluster algebras into cluster algebras of sufficiently large Grassmannians and show how the former is obtained from the latter by freezing certain cluster variables and specializing some cluster variables to one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, over a smooth quasi-projective curve, the set of non-isotrivial, smooth and projective families of polarized varieties with a fixed Hilbert polynomial and semi-ample canonical bundle is bounded. This extends the boundedness results of Arakelov, Parshin, and Kov\'acs--Lieblich beyond the canonically polarized case.</description>

Abstract: In the first part of this article, we give bounds on self-intersections $C^2$ of integral curves $C$ on blow-ups $Bl_nX$ of surfaces $X$ with the anti-cannonical divisor $-K_X$ effective.

      <title>Universal Koszul Duality for Kac-Moody Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a monoidal equivalence, called universal Koszul duality, between genuine equivariant K-motives on a Kac-Moody flag variety and constructible monodromic sheaves on its Langlands dual. The equivalence is obtained by a Soergel-theoretic description of both sides which extends results for finite-dimensional flag varieties by Taylor and the first author.
  Universal Koszul duality bundles together a whole family of equivalences for each point of a maximal torus. At the identity, it recovers an ungraded version of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel's and Bezrukavnikov-Yun's Koszul duality for equivariant and unipotently monodromic sheaves. It also generalizes Soergel-theoretic descriptions for monodromic categories on finite-dimensional flag varieties by Lusztig-Yun, Gouttard and the second author. For affine Kac-Moody groups, our work sheds new light on the conjectured quantum Satake equivalences by Cautis-Kamnitzer and Gaitsgory.
  On our way, we establish foundations on six functors for reduced K-motives and introduce a formalism of constructible monodromic sheaves.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers Do Enumerative Geometry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can Transformers model and learn enumerative geometry? What is a robust procedure for using Transformers in abductive knowledge discovery within a mathematician-machine collaboration? In this work, we introduce a new paradigm in computational enumerative geometry in analyzing the $\psi$-class intersection numbers on the moduli space of curves. By formulating the enumerative problem as a continuous optimization task, we develop a Transformer-based model for computing $\psi$-class intersection numbers based on the underlying quantum Airy structure. For a finite range of genera, our model is capable of regressing intersection numbers that span an extremely wide range of values, from $10^{-45}$ to $10^{45}$. To provide a proper inductive bias for capturing the recursive behavior of intersection numbers, we propose a new activation function, Dynamic Range Activator (DRA). Moreover, given the severe heteroscedasticity of $\psi$-class intersections and the required precision, we quantify the uncertainty of the predictions using Conformal Prediction with a dynamic sliding window that is aware of the number of marked points. Next, we go beyond merely computing intersection numbers and explore the enumerative "world-model" of the Transformers. Through a series of causal inference and correlational interpretability analyses, we demonstrate that Transformers are actually modeling Virasoro constraints in a purely data-driven manner. Additionally, we provide evidence for the comprehension of several values appearing in the large genus asymptotic of $\psi$-class intersection numbers through abductive hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Deformations of Berglund H\"ubsch Mirror Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate here the deformations of Berglund H\"ubsch loop and chain mirrors where the original manifolds are defined in the same weighted projective space. We show that the deformations are equivalent by two methods. First, we map directly the two models to each other and show that the deformations are the same for $79$ "Good" models, but not for the $77$ "Bad" ones. We then investigate the orbifold of the mirror pair by the maximal symmetry group and show that the number of deformations is the same and that they are almost the same, i.e., the first four exponents of the deformations are identical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05713v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine defining equations for the set of concise tensors of minimal border rank in $C^m\otimes C^m\otimes C^m$ when $m=5$ and the set of concise minimal border rank $1_*$-generic tensors when $m=5,6$. We solve this classical problem in algebraic complexity theory with the aid of two recent developments: the 111-equations defined by Buczy\'{n}ska-Buczy\'{n}ski and results of Jelisiejew-\v{S}ivic on the variety of commuting matrices. We introduce a new algebraic invariant of a concise tensor, its 111-algebra, and exploit it to give a strengthening of Friedland's normal form for $1$-degenerate tensors satisfying Strassen's equations. We use the 111-algebra to characterize wild minimal border rank tensors and classify them in $C^5\otimes C^5\otimes C^5$.</description>

      <title>Hypertoric varieties, $W$-Hilbert schemes, and Coulomb branches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08125v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study transverse equivariant Hilbert schemes of affine hypertoric varieties equipped with a symplectic action of a Weyl group. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branches of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima can be obtained either as such Hilbert schemes or Hamiltonian reductions thereof. Furthermore, we propose that the Coulomb branches for representations of non-cotangent type are also obtained in this way. We also investigate the putative complete hyperk\"ahler metrics on these objects. We describe their twistor spaces and, in the case when the symplectic quotient construction of the hypertoric variety is $W$-equivariant (which includes Coulomb branches of cotangent type), we show that the hyperk\"ahler metric can be described as the natural $L^2$-metric on a moduli space of solutions to modified Nahm's equations on an interval with poles at both ends and a discontinuity in the middle, with the latter described by a new object: a hyperspherical variety canonically associated to a hypertoric variety.</description>

      <title>Mass formula for non-ordinary curves in one dimensional families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is about one dimensional families of cyclic covers of the projective line in positive characteristic. For each such family, we study the mass formula for the number of non-ordinary curves in the family. We prove two equations for the mass formula: the first relies on tautological intersection theory; and the second relies on the $a$-numbers of non-ordinary curves in the family. Our results generalize the Eichler--Deuring mass formula for supersingular elliptic curves; they also generalize some theorems of Ibukiyama, Katsura, and Oort about supersingular curves of genus $2$ that have an automorphism of order $3$ or order $4$. We determine the mass formula in many new cases, including linearized families of hyperelliptic curves of every genus and all families of cyclic covers of the projective line branched at four points.

      <title>Geometry of the signed support of a multivariate polynomial and Descartes' rule of signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the signed support, that is, the set of the exponent vectors and the signs of the coefficients, of a multivariate polynomial $f$. We describe conditions on the signed support ensuring that the semi-algebraic set, denoted as $\{ f &lt; 0 \}$, containing points in the positive real orthant where $f$ takes negative values, has at most one connected component. These results generalize Descartes' rule of signs in the sense that they provide a bound which is independent of the values of the coefficients and the degree of the polynomial. Based on how the exponent vectors lie on the faces of the Newton polytope, we give a recursive algorithm that verifies a sufficient condition for the set $\{ f &lt; 0 \}$ to have one connected component. We apply the algorithm to reaction networks in order to prove that the parameter region of multistationarity of a ubiquitous network comprising phosphorylation cycles is connected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the image of the Hodge-Tate logarithm map (in any cohomological degree), defined by Heuer, in the case of smooth Stein varieties. Heuer, motivated by the computations for the affine space of any dimension, raised the question whether this image is always equal to the group of closed differential forms. We show that it indeed always contains such forms but the quotient can be non-trivial: it contains a slightly mysterious $Z_p$-module that maps, via the Bloch-Kato exponential map, to integral classes in the pro-\'etale cohomology. This quotient is already non-trivial for open unit discs of dimension strictly greater than $1$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a cohomological field theory for a gauged linear sigma model space in geometric phase, using the method of gauge theory and differential geometry. The cohomological field theory is expected to match the Gromov-Witten theory of the classical vacuum up to a change of variable, and is expected to match various other algebraic geometric constructions.</description>

      <title>Integrality relations for polygonal dissections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a trapezoid dissected into triangles, the area of any triangle determined by either diagonal of the trapezoid is integral over the ring generated by the areas of the triangles in the dissection. Given a parallelogram dissected into triangles, the area of any one of the triangles of the dissection is integral over the ring generated by the areas of the other triangles. In both cases, the integrality relations are invariant under deformation of the dissection.
  The trapezoid theorem implies and provides a new context for Monsky's Equidissection Theorem that a square cannot be dissected into an odd number of triangles of equal area.
  A corollary of these results is that the area polynomials for parallelograms introduced in previous work have all leading coefficients equal to $\pm 1$.</description>

Butz and Moerdijk showed that every topos with enough points can be represented as the topos of sheaves on an open topological groupoid. This paper tackles a follow-up question: we characterise, in model-theoretic terms, which open topological groupoids can represent the classifying topos of a theory. Intuitively, this characterises which groupoids of models contain enough information to reconstruct the theory. Our treatment subsumes many of the previous approaches found in the literature, such as that of Awodey, Forssell, Butz and Moerdijk.</description>

Abstract: We introduce polyhedral products in an $\infty$-categorical setting. We generalize a splitting result by Bahri, Bendersky, Cohen, and Gitler that determines the stable homotopy type of the a polyhedral product. We also introduce a motivic refinement of moment-angle complexes and use the splitting result to compute cellular $\mathbb{A}^1$-homology, and $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristics.</description>
