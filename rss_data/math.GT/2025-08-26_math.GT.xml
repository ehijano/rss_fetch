      <title>Causality Detection via Symplectic Quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether symplectic quandle colorings can reveal causal structure encoded by "sky links" - i.e. links consisting of spheres of all light rays through two points in the space of all light rays of a spacetime. Building on the known limitations of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, we compare the connected sum of two Hopf links (which represents all causally unrelated situations) with the first two Allen-Swenberg links (that are the only known examples when this polynomial does not work). For each diagram we report both the quandle counting invariant (total number of colorings) and an enhanced version that records how many distinct colors appear in each coloring. In our tests over small finite fields, plain counts often agree across examples, but the enhanced invariant consistently separates the Hopf case from the Allen-Swenberg family, and becomes more discriminating as the field grows. A simple transfer step suggests that this effect persists along the whole sequence. These results point to enhanced symplectic quandle colorings as a practical, computable indication of causality that classical polynomials alone may miss; the first examples of this kind were discovered by Jain.</description>

      <title>Closed Formulas for $\eta$-Corrections in the Once Punctured Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\eta$-correction terms in the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the once-punctured torus $K_t(\Sigma_{1,1})$. While the Frohman-Gelca product-to-sum rule is explicit on the closed torus, punctures introduce correction terms in the ideal $(\eta)$ whose structure has resisted systematic description beyond low-determinant cases. We give a closed form for the family $P_n=(1,0)\cdot T_n((1,2))$ (determinant $2$): the correction $\epsilon_n$ has an explicit Chebyshev expansion with coefficients that factor as geometric sums in $t^{\pm4}$ governed by parity. Tracking creation and cancellation of $\eta$ through the Chebyshev recurrence, and using diffeomorphism invariance, the formula transports to all products $C_1\cdot T_k(C_2)$ with $|\det(C_1,C_2)|=2$.
  We further treat the \emph{primitive maximal-thread} regime, where one Frohman-Gelca summand is fully threaded and the other is simple or doubly covered. In this case we obtain a closed form for the discrepancy: an $\eta$-linear cascade with Chebyshev $S$-coefficients that lowers the thread degree by two at each step. Equivalently, in this maximal-thread regime we solve the specialized Wang-Wong recursion in closed form; the coefficients match their fast algorithm term-by-term (up to the $T_0$ normalization) and subsume Cho's $|\det|=2$ case. The resulting rules give compact, scalable formulas for symbolic multiplication in $K_t(\Sigma_{1,1})$</description>

      <title>Unique Surgery Descriptions along Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any non-trivial knot K, infinitely many r-surgeries K(r) along K have a unique surgery description along a knot. Moreover, we show that for any hyperbolic L-space knot K and infinitely many integer slopes n, the manifold K(n) has a unique surgery description. Here we say a 3-manifold M has a unique surgery description along a knot in S^3 if there is a unique pair (K,r) of a knot K and a slope r such that M is orientation-preservingly diffeomorphic to K(r). This generalises the notion of characterising slopes. Conversely, we provide new families of manifolds with several distinct surgery descriptions along knots. More precisely, we construct for every non-zero integer m a knot K_m such that for any integer n, the manifold K_m(m+1/n) can also be obtained by surgery on another knot.</description>

      <title>Minimal complexity cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds with geodesic boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early 2000s, Frigerio, Martelli, and Petronio studied $3$-manifolds of smallest combinatorial complexity that admit hyperbolic structures. As part of this work they defined and studied the class $M_{g,k}$ of smallest complexity manifolds having $k$ torus cusps and connected totally geodesic boundary a surface of genus $g$. In this paper, we provide a complete classification of the manifolds in $M_{k,k}$ and $M_{k+1,k}$, which are the cases when the genus $g$ is as small as possible. In addition to classifying manifolds in $M_{k,k}$, $M_{k+1,k}$, we describe their isometry groups as well as a relationship between these two sets via Dehn filling on small slopes. Finally, we give a description of important commensurability invariants of the manifolds in $M_{k,k}$.</description>

      <title>Thurston's jiggling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1970s Thurston introduced a technique known as ``jiggling'' which brings any triangulation into general position (a stronger version of transversality) by subdividing and perturbing. This result is now known as Thurston's jiggling lemma. In this paper we provide an alternative, more conceptual proof of the lemma. In particular we also prove the generalization to manifolds, whose proof had previously only been sketched.</description>

      <title>The LMO Spectrum: Factorization Homology and the E_3-Structure of the Jacobi Diagram Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for the categorification of the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki (LMO) invariant of 3-manifolds, defining a new invariant, the LMO Spectrum, via factorization homology. The theoretical foundation of this framework is the main algebraic result of this paper (Theorem A): a proof that the algebra of Jacobi diagrams, A_Jac, possesses the structure of a homotopy E3-algebra. This algebraic structure is shown to be a consequence of 3-dimensional geometry, originating from a "Tetrahedron Principle" where the fundamental IHX relation is interpreted as an algebraic manifestation of the tetrahedron's combinatorial properties. This geometric perspective is used to provide a rigorous proof of the "Principle of Decomposability" that underpins the Goussarov-Habiro clasper calculus, thereby supplying a mathematical justification for the consistency of this geometric surgery theory. To establish a computational basis, the framework is built from the first principles of factorization homology, from which a universal surgery formula is derived via the excision axiom (Theorem B) independently of any conjectural models. The utility of this axiomatically-grounded theory is demonstrated by constructing a new observable, the "H_1-decorated LMO invariant." This invariant is defined in accordance with the principles of TQFT, where the evaluation of a closed diagram (a numerical invariant) is the trace of the corresponding open diagram (an operator). As the main applied result of this paper (Theorem C), it is proven that this invariant distinguishes the lens spaces L(156, 5) and L(156, 29), a pair known to be indistinguishable by the classical LMO invariant. This result validates the proposed framework and establishes the LMO Spectrum as a new tool in quantum topology that unifies the geometric intuition of clasper theory with the algebraic rigor of modern homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>On the 2-loop part of the Johnson cokernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stable Sp-decompositions of the cokernel of the Johnson homomorphism. Continuing the work of Conant in 2016, which identified the 1-loop part of the Johnson cokernel as the Enomoto-Satoh obstruction, we study the 2-loop part. Using the corresponding 2-loop trace map, we capture all the components of the Johnson cokernels in degree 6 that cannot be detected by the Enomoto-Satoh trace.</description>

      <title>Exotic non-orientable four-manifolds with prescribed fundamental group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any finitely presented group with an index two subgroup is realized as the fundamental group of a closed smooth non-orientable four-manifold that admits an exotic smooth structure, which is obtained by performing a Gluck twist. The orientation 2-covers of these four-manifolds are diffeomorphic. These two smooth structures remain inequivalent after adding arbitrarily many copies of the product of a pair of 2-spheres and stabilize after adding a single copy of the complex projective plane.</description>

      <title>Full twists and stability of knots and quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate the stability of knot invariants under twisting a pair of strands to the stability of symmetric quivers under unlinking (or linking) operation. Starting from the HOMFLY-PT skein relations, we confirm the stable growth of $Sym^r$-coloured HOMFLY-PT polynomials under the addition of a~full twist to the knot. On the other hand, we show that symmetric quivers exhibit analogous stable growth under unlinking or linking of the quiver augmented with the extra node; in some cases this augmented quiver captures the spectrum of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of all quivers in the sequence. Combining these two versions of the stable growth, we conjecture that performing a~full twist on any knot corresponds to appropriate unlinking or linking of the corresponding augmented quiver -- this statement is an important step towards a~direct definition of the knot-quiver correspondence based on the knot diagram. We confirm the conjecture for all twist knots, $(2,2p+1)$ torus knots, and all pretzel knots up to 15 crossings with an~odd number of twists in each twist region.</description>

      <title>Correspondences on hyperelliptic surfaces, combination theorems, and Hurwitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a general class of correspondences on hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus that combine finitely many Fuchsian genus zero orbifold groups and Blaschke products. As an intermediate step, we first construct analytic combinations of these objects as partially defined maps on the Riemann sphere. We then give an algebraic characterization of these analytic combinations in terms of hyperelliptic involutions and meromorphic maps on compact Riemann surfaces. These involutions and meromorphic maps, in turn, give rise to the desired correspondences. The moduli space of such correspondences can be identified with a product of Teichm\"uller spaces and Blaschke spaces. The explicit description of the correspondences then allows us to construct a dynamically natural injection of this product space into appropriate Hurwitz spaces.</description>

      <title>Random punctured hyperbolic surfaces &amp; the Brownian sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random genus-0 hyperbolic surfaces $\mathcal{S}_n$ with $n + 1$ punctures, sampled according to the Weil-Petersson measure. We show that, after rescaling the metric by $n^{-1/4}$, the surface $\mathcal{S}_n$ converges in distribution to the Brownian sphere - a random compact metric space homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, exhibiting fractal geometry and appearing as a universal scaling limit in various models of random planar maps. Without rescaling the metric, we establish a local Benjamini--Schramm convergence of $\mathcal{S}_n$ to a random infinite-volume hyperbolic surface with countably many punctures, homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \mathbb{Z}^2$. Our proofs mirror techniques from the theory of random planar maps. In particular, we develop an encoding of punctured hyperbolic surfaces via a family of plane trees with continuous labels, akin to Schaeffer's bijection. This encoding stems from the Epstein-Penner decomposition and, through a series of transformations, reduces to a model of single-type Galton--Watson trees, enabling the application of known invariance principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum $q$-series invariants of 3-manifolds $\widehat{Z}_\sigma$ of Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, using techniques from the theory of normal surface singularities such as splice diagrams. We show that the (suitably normalized) sum of all $\widehat{Z}_\sigma$ depends only on the splice diagram, and in particular, it agrees for manifolds with the same universal abelian cover. We use these ideas to find simple formulas for $\widehat{Z}_\sigma$ invariants of Seifert manifolds. Applications include a better understanding of the vanishing of the $q$-series $\widehat{Z}_\sigma$. Additionally, we study moduli spaces of flat $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ connections on Seifert manifolds and their relation to spectra of surface singularities, extending a result of Boden and Curtis for Brieskorn spheres to Seifert rational homology spheres with 3 singular fibers and to Seifert homology spheres with any number of fibers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop analysis of H\"older continuous mappings with applications to geometry and topology of the Heisenberg groups. We cover the theory of distributional Jacobians of H\"older continuous mappings and pullbacks of differential forms under H\"older continuous mappings. That includes versions of the change of variables formula and the Stokes theorem for H\"older continuous mappings. The main applications are in the setting of the Heisenberg groups, where we provide a simple proof of a generalization of the Gromov non-embedding theorem, and new results about the H\"older homotopy groups of the Heisenberg groups.</description>
