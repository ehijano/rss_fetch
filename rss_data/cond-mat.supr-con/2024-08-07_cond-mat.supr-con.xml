      <title>Superconducting gap modulations: are they from pair density waves or pair-breaking scattering?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his seminal work published in Acta Physica Sinica in 1965, Yu Lu pointed out that the superconducting gap exhibits weak modulations near the pair-breaking magnetic impurity in a superconductor. In the past ten years, a series of high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy works reported weak superconducting gap modulations in certain superconductors and explained these phenomena as pair density waves. In line with Yu's discovery, Lee DH et al. pointed out that in many cases, the interference effect of pair-breaking scattering can also lead to superconducting gap modulations in space. We will discuss the distinction and unification of these two kinds of mechanisms, as well as their relevance to recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Chiral kagome superconductivity modulations with residual Fermi arcs in KV3Sb5 and CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity involving finite momentum pairing can lead to spatial gap and pair density modulations, as well as Bogoliubov Fermi states within the superconducting gap. However, the experimental realization of their intertwined relations has been challenging. Here, we detect chiral kagome superconductivity modulations with residual Fermi arcs in KV3Sb5 and CsV3Sb5 by normal and Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy down to 30mK with resolved electronic energy difference at microelectronvolt level. We observe a U-shaped superconducting gap with flat residual in-gap states. This gap exhibits chiral 2 by 2 spatial modulations with magnetic field tunable chirality, which align with the chiral 2 by 2 pair density modulations observed through Josephson tunneling. These findings demonstrate a chiral pair density wave (PDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Quasiparticle interference imaging of the in-gap zero-energy states reveals segmented arcs, with high-temperature data linking them to parts of the reconstructed V d-orbital states within the charge order. The detected residual Fermi arcs can be explained by the partial suppression of these d-orbital states through an interorbital 2 by 2 PDW and thus serve as candidate Bogoliubov Fermi states. Additionally, we differentiate the observed PDW order from impurity-induced gap modulations. Our observations not only uncover a chiral PDW order with orbital-selectivity, but also illuminate the fundamental space-momentum correspondence inherent in finite momentum paired superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Evidence chain for time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagome superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity and magnetism are antagonistic quantum matter, while their intertwining has long been considered in frustrated-lattice systems1-3. In this work, we utilize scanning tunneling microscopy and muon spin resonance to discover time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductivity in kagome metal Cs(V,Ta)3Sb5, where the Cooper pairing exhibits magnetism and is modulated by it. In the magnetic channel, we observe spontaneous internal magnetism in a full-gap superconducting state. Under perturbations of inverse magnetic fields, we detect a time-reversal asymmetrical interference of Bogoliubov quasi-particles at a circular vector. At this vector, the pairing gap spontaneously modulates, which is distinct from pair density waves occurring at a point vector and consistent with the theoretical proposal of unusual interference effect under time-reversal symmetry-breaking. The correlation between internal magnetism, Bogoliubov quasi-particles, and pairing modulation provides a chain of experimental clues for time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagome superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent theory of $2\times2$ pair density waves in kagome superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair density wave (PDW) is an intriguing quantum matter proposed in the frontier of condensed matter physics. However, the existence of PDW in microscopic models has been rare. In this work, we obtain, by Ginzburg-Landau arguments and self-consistent mean field theory, novel $2a_0\times2a_0$ PDW on the kagome lattice arising from attractive on-bond pairing interactions and the distinct Bloch wave functions near the p-type van Hove singularity. The PDW state carrying three independent wave-vectors, the so-called 3Q PDW, is nodeless and falls into two topological classes characterized by the Chern number $C = 0$ or $C = \pm2$. The chiral ($C=\pm2$) PDW state presents a rare case of interaction driven topological quantum state without the requirement of spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we analyze the stabilities and properties of these PDWs intertwining with charge orders, and discuss the relevance of our minimal model to recent experimental observations in kagome superconductors. Our theory not only elucidates the driving force of the chiral PDW, but also predicts strongly anisotropic superconducting gap structure in the momentum space and quantized transverse thermal conductivity that can be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Correlation between $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and the Pseudogap Observed in the Optical Spectra of High $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ Superconducting Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the temperature dependences of the optical spectra for optimally and underdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+z}$ single crystals. Similarly to the other cuprates' cases, a gap-like conductivity suppression was observed with reducing the temperature from above $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, creating a peak in the conductivity spectrum. The conductivity peak energy was insensitive to the doping level, namely $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, which suggests that this gap is not a superconducting gap but is related to the pseudogap. Comparing the data of various mono-, double-, and triple-layer cuprates, we found a clear correlation between the optimal $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of each material and the pseudogap-related conductivity peak energy.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancement of superconductivity via engineered dielectric environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently showed that strong enhancement of superconductivity can occur in systems with a resonant anti-shielding effect wherein the nonlocal dielectric function of the environment vanishes. This effect is universal, since it relies on the fact that Cooper pairs, regardless of the pairing mechanism, are simply charges that can be affected by external charges / fields induced in an engineered dielectric environment. In our earlier work, we proposed a composite system containing a superconductor and a topological insulator that satisfies the stringent conditions for the anti-shielding. Here, we propose a superlattice system containing a metal-organic framework medium that also satisfies these conditions, but with the effect even stronger and more controllable. Our estimates show that ambient temperature and pressure operation could be achievable in this configuration with e.g. MgB2, or even with cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>From perfect to imperfect poor man's Majoranas in minimal Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poor man's Majoranas (PMMs) hold the promise to engineer Majorana bound states in a highly tunable setup consisting of a chain of quantum dots that are connected via superconductors. Due to recent progress in controlling the amplitudes of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR), two vital ingredients for PMMs, experimental investigations of PMMs have gained significant interest. Previously, analytic conditions for the "sweet spots" that result in PMMs have focused on systems with infinite Zeeman energy. Here, we derive analytically a sweet spot condition for PMMs in a system with finite Zeeman energy in the absence of Coulomb interaction. We then consider two numerical models, one in which ECT and CAR are transmitted via superconducting bulk states and one in which they are transmitted via an Andreev bound state. In both models we find numerically near zero-energy states that are highly localized, even in the presence of finite Coulomb interaction. These states can be related to the analytic sweet spot derived in this work. However, we also find that in these more realistic models such states do not perfectly satisfy the characteristics of PMMs, rather they exist only within a "region of threshold" where PMM characteristics are approximately achieved.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of bipolarons from quadratic electron-phonon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In systems with linear electron-phonon interaction (EPI), bound states of polarons, or bipolarons, form by gaining energy from the lattice deformation. The quadratic EPI case is fundamentally different: bipolarons form because electrons lose less energy when the total charge density is "compacted". As the coupling constant is increased, the bipolarons first appear as extended (but finite radius) soliton-type states. They subsequently decrease in radius until their size reaches the inter-atomic scale. We present the first numerically exact solution of the bipolaron problem from quadratic EPI in the presence of both on-site Hubbard and long-range Coulomb repulsion, and compute estimates of the largest superconducting transition temperature within the bipolaron mechanism. We find that $T_c/\Omega$ ratios, where $\Omega$ is the optical phonon frequency, can be several times larger than what one may expect from the linear EPI provided the phonon frequency is increased by orders of magnitude on occupied sites. Electron-electron repulsion can be tolerated at the expense of stronger EPI and the most detrimental effect comes from the Coulomb potential because it easily eliminates extended soliton states.</description>

      <title>Molecular Pairing in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theory for how the weak phonon-mediated interaction ($J_{\rm A}\!=\!1\!\sim\!4$meV) wins over the prohibitive Coulomb repulsion ($U\!=\!30\!\sim\!60$meV) and leads to a superconductor in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). We find the pairing mechanism akin to that in the A$_3$C$_{60}$ family of molecular superconductors: Each AA stacking region of MATBG resembles a C$_{60}$ molecule, in that optical phonons can dynamically lift the degeneracy of the moir\'e orbitals, in analogy to the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect. Such induced $J_{\rm A}$ has the form of an inter-valley anti-Hund's coupling and is less suppressed than $U$ by the Kondo screening near a Mott insulator. Additionally, we also considered an intra-orbital Hund's coupling $J_{\rm H}$ that originates from the on-site repulsion of a carbon atom. Under a reasonable approximation of the realistic model, we prove that the renormalized local interaction between quasi-particles must have a pairing (negative) channel in a doped correlated insulator at $\nu=\pm(2+\delta\nu)$, albeit the bare interaction is positive definite. The proof is non-perturbative and based on exact asymptotic behaviors of the vertex function imposed by Ward identities. Existence of an optimal $U$ for superconductivity is predicted. We also analyzed the pairing symmetry. In a large area of the parameter space of $J_{\rm A}$, $J_{\rm H}$, the ground state has a nematic $d$-wave singlet pairing, which, however, can lead to a $p$-wave-like nodal structure due to the Berry's phase on Fermi surfaces (or Euler obstruction).</description>

      <title>Large self-heating by trapped-flux reduction in Sn-Pb solders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic flux trapping in field-cooled (FC) Sn-Pb solders has been recently studied because of the observation of nonvolatile magneto-thermal switching [H. Arima et al., Commun. Mater. 5, 34 (2024)] and anomalous magnetic field-temperature (H-T) phase diagrams [T. Murakami et al., AIP Adv. 13, 125008 (2023)]. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the anomalously low specific heat (C) in Sn10-Pb90 and Sn45-Pb55 solders after FC at H = 1500 Oe. We show that the FC solders exhibit self-heating possibly caused by the flux flow during the reduction of trapped fluxes when heating the sample during the C measurements. The T dependence of T rise clearly exhibits unexpectedly large values when the low-C states are observed. In addition, the cause of the transition-like behavior in C-T of FC solders are explained by local heating during H control and flux-jump phenomena.</description>

      <title>Holstein polarons, Rashba-like spin splitting and Ising superconductivity in electron-doped MoSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interaction between electrons and phonons in solids is a key effect defining physical properties of materials such as electrical and thermal conductivity. In transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) the electron-phonon coupling results in the creation of polarons, quasiparticles that manifest themselves as discrete features in the electronic spectral function. In this study, we report the formation of polarons at the alkali dosed MoSe2 surface, where Rashba-like spin splitting of the conduction band states is caused by an inversion-symmetry breaking electric field. In addition, we observe the crossover from phonon-like to plasmon-like polaronic spectral features at MoSe2 surface with increasing doping. Our findings support the concept of electron-phonon coupling mediated superconductivity in electron-doped layered TMDC materials, observed using ionic liquid gating technology. Furthermore, the discovered spin-splitting at the Fermi level could offer crucial experimental validation for theoretical models of Ising-type superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and composite order in $\mathrm{U}(1)^N$ lattice London models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.10850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase diagrams and the nature of the phase transitions in multicomponent gauge theories with an Abelian gauge field are important topics with various physical applications. While an early renormalization-group-based study indicated that the direct transition from a fully ordered to a fully disordered state is continuous for $N = 1$ and $N &gt; 183$, recently it was demonstrated that the transition is discontinuous for $N = 2$. We quantitatively study the dependence on $N$ of the degree of discontinuity of this transition. Our results suggest that the transition is discontinuous at least up to $N = 7$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, at increased coupling strength, the phase transitions of the neutral and charged sectors of the model split, which for $N &gt; 2$ yields a new phase with composite order. The transition from the composite-order phase to the fully disordered phase is then also discontinuous, at least for $N = 3$ and $N = 4$. Via a duality argument, this indicates that van der Waals-type interaction between directed loops may be responsible for the discontinuous phase transitions in these models.</description>
