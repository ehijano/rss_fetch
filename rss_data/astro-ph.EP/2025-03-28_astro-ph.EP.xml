      <title>CETRA: A fast, sensitive exoplanet transit detection algorithm implemented for GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Cambridge Exoplanet Transit Recovery Algorithm (CETRA), a fast and sensitive transit detection algorithm, optimised for GPUs. CETRA separates the task into a search for transit signals across linear time space, followed by a phase-folding of the former to enable a periodic signal search, using a physically motivated transit model to improve detection sensitivity. It outperforms traditional methods like Box Least Squares and Transit Least Squares in both sensitivity and speed. Tests on synthetic light curves demonstrate that CETRA can identify at least 20 per cent more low-SNR transits than Transit Least Squares in the same data, particularly those of long period planets. It is also shown to be up to a few orders of magnitude faster for high cadence light curves, enabling rapid large-scale searches.
  Through application of CETRA to Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite short cadence data, we recover the three planets in the HD 101581 system with improved significance. In particular, the transit signal of the previously unvalidated planet TOI-6276.03 is enhanced from ${\rm SNR}=7.9$ to ${\rm SNR}=16.0$, which means it may now meet the criteria for statistical validation.
  CETRA's speed and sensitivity make it well-suited for current and future exoplanet surveys, particularly in the search for Earth analogues. Our implementation of this algorithm uses NVIDIA's CUDA platform and requires an NVIDIA GPU, it is open-source and available from GitHub and PyPI.</description>

      <title>Size Constraint on Hayabusa2 Extended Mission Rendezvous Target 1998~KY$_{26}$ via VLT/VISIR Non-detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1998~KY$_{26}$ is a tiny near-Earth asteroid ($H=26.1$) discovered in 1998. It has been selected as the target of the Hayabusa2 extended mission, which will rendezvous with 1998 KY$_{26}$ in 2031. However, one of the most basic physical properties, size, remains poorly constrained, posing potential challenges for spacecraft operations. We aimed at constraining the size of 1998 KY$_{26}$ by means of thermal infrared observations. We performed thermal infrared observations of 1998 KY$_{26}$ using the ESO Very Large Telescope/VISIR on three consecutive nights in May 2024. After stacking all frames, we find no apparent detection of 1998 KY$_{26}$ on the resulting images. The upper-limit flux density of 1998 KY$_{26}$ is derived as 2 mJy at 10.64 $\mu$m. From this upper-limit flux density obtained via non-detection, we conclude that the diameter of 1998 KY$_{26}$ is smaller than 17 m with thermophysical modeling. This upper limit size is smaller than the radar-derived 30 ($\pm$ 10)\,m. Our size constraint on 1998 KY$_{26}$ is essential for the operation of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft during proximity operations using remote sensing instruments as well as a possible impact experiment using the remaining projectile.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Mapping with MIRI: 2D Map of HD 189733b from $8\mu m$ JWST MIRI LRS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations and models of transiting hot Jupiter exoplanets indicate that atmospheric circulation features may cause large spatial flux contrasts across their daysides. Previous studies have mapped these spatial flux variations through inversion of secondary eclipse data. Though eclipse mapping requires high signal-to-noise data, the first successful eclipse map--made for HD 189733b using $8\mu m$ Spitzer IRAC data--showed the promise of the method. JWST eclipse observations provide the requisite data quality to access the unique advantages of eclipse mapping. Using two JWST MIRI LRS eclipse observations centered on $8\mu m$ to mimic the Spitzer bandpass used in previous studies, combined with the Spitzer IRAC $8\mu m$ eclipses and partial phase curve (necessitated to disentangle map and systematic signals), we present a 2-dimensional dayside temperature map. Our best-fit model is a 2-component 5th-degree harmonic model with an unprecedentedly constrained eastward hotspot offset of $33.0^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$ degrees. We rule out a strong hemispheric latitudinal hotspot offset, as 3+ component maps providing latitudinal degrees of freedom are strongly disfavored. As in previous studies we find some model dependence in longitudinal hotspot offset; when we explore and combine a range of proximal models to avoid an overly constrained confidence region, we find an eastward hotspot offset of $32.5^{+3.0}_{-10.6}$ degrees, indicating the presence of a strong eastward zonal jet. Our map is consistent with some previous eclipse maps of HD 189733b, though it indicates a higher longitudinal offset from others. It is largely consistent with predictions from general circulation models (GCMs) at the 115 mbar level near the $8\mu m$ photosphere.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Timing Variations of Circumbinary Substellar Objects in TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets and brown dwarfs form in complex gravitational environments, offering insights into formation, orbital stability, and habitability prospects. However, they remain underrepresented, with only 60 confirmed or candidate systems known. In this work, we leverage TESS photometry to search for circumbinary companions through eclipse timing variations (ETVs), analyzing 152 detached eclipsing binaries. By modeling eclipse timings, we identify 26 systems with significant periodic signals, 14 of which have false alarm probabilities below 0.01. While no detections are confirmed, TIC 350297040 emerges as a candidate for a circumbinary brown dwarf ($0.06~M_{\odot}$) under the assumption of a $1~M_{\odot}$ binary system, though further investigation is required. Simulations using synthetic ETVs indicate a 5\% recovery rate for circumbinary brown dwarfs and 0.1\% for Jupiter-like planets, with median masses of $56.6^{+16.5}{-23.4}~M_{\rm J}$ and periods of $1404^{+1361}_{-953}$ d. Our simulations show that the smallest detectable mass is $1.6~M_{\rm J}$ at a period of 1860 d and confirm that ETV methods are effective in detecting misaligned systems. In the absence of a detection, we set an upper limit of 40\% on the occurrence rate of circumbinary brown dwarfs at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level, while a confirmed single detection would imply an occurrence rate of 13.08\%. These constraints are consistent with previous abundance estimates for circumbinary brown dwarfs ($\lesssim6.5\%$) but motivate a larger sample size. Furthermore, the very low recovery rates provide insights into the debate on first- and second-generation planet formation around post-common envelope binaries.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection in the Plasma Disk at 23 Jupiter Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key open question in astrophysics is how plasma is transported within strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating systems. Magnetic reconnection and flux tube interchange are possible mechanisms, with Jupiter serving as the best local analog for distant systems. However, magnetic reconnection at Jupiter remains poorly understood. A key indicator of active magnetic reconnection is the ion diffusion region, but its detection at Jupiter has remained unconfirmed. Here, we report a unique magnetic reconnection event in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere that presents the first detection of an ion diffusion region. We provide evidence that this event involves localized flux tube interchange motion driven by centrifugal forces, which occurs inside a thin current sheet formed by the collision and twisting of two distinct flux tubes. This study provides new insights into Io-genic plasma transport at Jupiter and the unique role of magnetic reconnection in rapidly rotating systems, two key unresolved questions.</description>

      <title>Cometary Observations in Light-Polluted Environments: A case study of Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comets and asteroids have long captured human curiosity, and until recently, all documented examples belonged to our Solar System. That changed with the discovery of the first known interstellar object, 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua), in 2017. Two years later, Gennady Borisov discovered a second interstellar object: 2I/Borisov. From its initial images, the object's diffuse appearance hinted at its cometary nature. To better understand the photometric evolution of comet 2I as it traveled through the inner Solar System, we compiled observations using medium-sized telescopes. This data is crucial for gaining insights into its size and composition, as well as how such objects, after millions of years in interstellar space, behave when exposed to the Sun's radiation. Given that 2I is the first interstellar comet ever observed, constraining its behavior is of great scientific interest. In this paper, we present photometric data gathered from observatories in Crimea and Catalonia, highlighting the importance of systematic photometric studies of interstellar objects using meter-class telescopes. Our observations showed a steady increase in the comet's brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the slow sublimation of ices. Over the pre-perihelion observation period, we did not detect any significant changes in magnitude. The analysis of observations reveals a steady increase in comet brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the sublimation of ices, with no observable outbursts during the five-month pre-perihelion period. Additionally, we discuss the challenges in ground-based observation of comets posed by light pollution today, particularly in urban areas, where visual observations are severely limited. Using sample surface brightness measurements, we demonstrate the impact of light pollution and outline the importance of systematic photometric studies for interstellar objects.</description>

      <title>ALMA 2D Super-resolution Imaging Survey of Ophiuchus Class I/Flat Spectrum/II Disks -- I: Discovery of New Disk Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on Class I, Flat Spectrum (FS), and Class II disks in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, a nearby active star-forming region with numerous young stellar objects (YSOs), to unveil signs of substructure formation in these disks. We employ two-dimensional super-resolution imaging based on Sparse Modeling (SpM) for ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data, achieving images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au (0".02-0".2) for 78 dust disks, all of which are spatially resolved. In our sample, we confirm that approximately 30-40% of the disks exhibit substructures, and we identify new substructures in 15 disks (4 Class I, 7 Class FS, and 4 Class II objects). Compared to the eDisk sample in terms of bolometric temperature, Tbol, our targets are in a relatively later accretion phase. By combining our targets with the eDisk sample, we confirm that substructure detection in available data is restricted to objects where Tbol exceeds 200-300 K and the dust disk radius, Rdust, is larger than ~30 au. Moreover, we find that the distribution of inclination angles for Class II disks has a deficit of high values and is not consistent with being random. Analyzing molecular line emission data around these objects will be crucial to constrain disk evolutionary stages further and understand when and how substructures form.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey VII: Clouds and line asymmetries in CRIRES$^+$ J-band spectra of the Luhman 16 binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs at the L-T transition likely experience an inhomogeneous clearing of the clouds in their atmospheres. The resulting surface of thin and thick cloudy patches has been put forward to explain the observed variability, J-band brightening, and re-emergence of FeH absorption. We study the closest brown dwarf binary, Luhman 16A and B, in an effort to constrain their chemical and cloud compositions. As this binary consists of an L7.5 and T0.5 component, we gain insight into the atmospheric properties at the L-T transition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we observed Luhman 16AB at high spectral resolution in the J-band ($1.1-1.4\ \mathrm{\mu m}$) using CRIRES$^+$. To analyse the spectra, we employ an atmospheric retrieval framework, coupling the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS with the MultiNest sampling algorithm. For both objects, we report detections of H$_2$O, K, Na, FeH, and, for the first time in the J-band, hydrogen-fluoride (HF). The K doublet at $1250\ \mathrm{nm}$ shows asymmetric absorption in the blue line wings, which are reproduced via pressure- and temperature-dependent shifts of the line cores. We find evidence for clouds in both spectra and we place constraints on an FeH-depletion in the Luhman 16A photosphere. The inferred over-abundance of FeH for Luhman 16B opposes its predicted rainout into iron clouds. A two-column model, which emulates the patchy surface expected at the L-T transition, is weakly preferred ($\sim 1.8\sigma$) for component B but disfavoured for A ($\sim 5.5\sigma$). The results suggest a uniform surface on Luhman 16A, which is in good agreement with the reduced variability observed for this L-type component. While the presented evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about any inhomogeneity on Luhman 16B, future observations covering a broader wavelength range could help to test the cloud-clearing hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Enabling Robust Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrievals with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric retrievals are essential tools for interpreting exoplanet transmission and eclipse spectra, enabling quantitative constraints on the chemical composition, aerosol properties, and thermal structure of planetary atmospheres. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers unprecedented spectral precision, resolution, and wavelength coverage, unlocking transformative insights into the formation, evolution, climate, and potential habitability of planetary systems. However, this opportunity is accompanied by challenges: modeling assumptions and unaccounted-for noise or signal sources can bias retrieval outcomes and their interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian Process (GP)-aided atmospheric retrieval framework that flexibly accounts for unmodeled features in exoplanet spectra, whether global or localized. We validate this method on synthetic JWST observations and show that GP-aided retrievals reduce bias in inferred abundances and better capture model-data mismatches than traditional approaches. We also introduce the concept of mean squared error to quantify the trade-off between bias and variance, arguing that this metric more accurately reflects retrieval performance than bias alone. We then reanalyze the NIRISS/SOSS JWST transmission spectrum of WASP-96 b, finding that GP-aided retrievals yield broader constraints on CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, alleviating tension between previous retrieval results and equilibrium predictions. Our GP framework provides precise and accurate constraints while highlighting regions where models fail to explain the data. As JWST matures and future facilities come online, a deeper understanding of the limitations of both data and models will be essential, and GP-enabled retrievals like the one presented here offer a principled path forward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present globally inverted pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagrams up to 5,000 GPa for four fundamental planetary materials, Fe, MgO, SiO2, and MgSiO3, derived from logistic regression and supervised learning, together with an experimental phase equilibria database. These new P-T phase diagrams provide a solution to long-standing disputes about their melting curves. Their implications extend to the melting and freezing of rocky materials in the interior of giant planets and super-Earth exoplanets, contributing to the refinement of their internal structure models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17463v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss generalized linear models for directional data where the conditional distribution of the response is a von Mises-Fisher distribution in arbitrary dimension or a Bingham distribution on the unit circle. To do this properly, we parametrize von Mises-Fisher distributions by Euclidean parameters and investigate computational aspects of this parametrization. Then we modify this approach for local polynomial regression as a means of nonparametric smoothing of distributional data. The methods are illustrated with simulated data and a data set from planetary sciences involving covariate vectors on a sphere with axial response.</description>

      <title>A link between rocky exoplanet composition and stellar age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interior compositions are key for our understanding of Earth-like exoplanets. The composition of the core can influence the presence of a magnetic dynamo and the strength of gravity on the planetary surface, both of which heavily impact thermal and possible biological processes and thus the habitability for life and its evolution on the planet. However, detailed measurements of the planetary interiors are extremely challenging for small exoplanets, and existing data suggest a wide diversity in planet compositions. Hitherto, only certain photospheric chemical abundances of the host stars have been considered as tracers to explain the diversity of exoplanet compositions. Here we present a homogeneous analysis of stars hosting rocky exoplanets, with ages between 2 and 14 Gyr, revealing a correlation between rocky exoplanet compositions and the ages of the planetary systems. Denser rocky planets are found around younger stars. This suggests that the compositional diversity of rocky exoplanets can be linked to the ages of their host stars. We interpret this to be a result of chemical evolution of stars in the Milky Way, which modifies the material out of which stars and planets form. The results imply that rocky planets which form today, at similar galactocentric radii, may have different formation conditions, and thus different properties than planets which formed several billion years ago, such as the Earth.</description>
