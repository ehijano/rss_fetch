      <title>Quantum computational complexity of matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dividing line between classical and quantum computational power in estimating properties of matrix functions. More precisely, we study the computational complexity of two primitive problems: given a function $f$ and a Hermitian matrix $A$, compute a matrix element of $f(A)$ or compute a local measurement on $f(A)|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$, with $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$ an $n$-qubit reference state vector, in both cases up to additive approximation error. We consider four functions -- monomials, Chebyshev polynomials, the time evolution function, and the inverse function -- and probe the complexity across a broad landscape covering different problem input regimes. Namely, we consider two types of matrix inputs (sparse and Pauli access), matrix properties (norm, sparsity), the approximation error, and function-specific parameters.
  We identify BQP-complete forms of both problems for each function and then toggle the problem parameters to easier regimes to see where hardness remains, or where the problem becomes classically easy. As part of our results we make concrete a hierarchy of hardness across the functions; in parameter regimes where we have classically efficient algorithms for monomials, all three other functions remain robustly BQP-hard, or hard under usual computational complexity assumptions. In identifying classically easy regimes, among others, we show that for any polynomial of degree $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ both problems can be efficiently classically simulated when $A$ has $O(\log n)$ non-zero coefficients in the Pauli basis. This contrasts with the fact that the problems are BQP-complete in the sparse access model even for constant row sparsity, whereas the stated Pauli access efficiently constructs sparse access with row sparsity $O(\log n)$. Our work provides a catalog of efficient quantum and classical algorithms for fundamental linear-algebra tasks.</description>

      <title>Transversal non-Clifford gates for quantum LDPC codes on sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major goal in quantum computing is to build a fault-tolerant quantum computer. One approach involves quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes that support transversal non-Clifford gates. In this work, we provide a large family of such codes. The key insight is to interpret the logical operators of qLDPC codes as geometric surfaces and use the intersection number of these surfaces to define the non-Clifford operation. At a more abstract level, this construction is based on defining the cup product on the chain complex induced from a sheaf.</description>

      <title>Quantum LDPC Codes with Transversal Non-Clifford Gates via Products of Algebraic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every integer $r\geq 2$ and every $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct an explicit infinite family of quantum LDPC codes supporting a transversal $C^{r-1}Z$ gate with length $N$, dimension $K\geq N^{1-\epsilon}$, distance $D\geq N^{1/r}/\operatorname{poly}(\log N)$, and stabilizer weight $w\leq\operatorname{poly}(\log N)$. The previous state of the art construction (in most parameter regimes) was the $r$-dimensional color code, which has only constant dimension $K=O(1)$, and otherwise has the same parameters up to polylogarithmic factors. Our construction provides the first known codes with low-weight stabilizers that are capable of magic state distillation with arbitrarily small yield parameter $\gamma=\log(N/K)/\log(D)&gt;0$.
  A classical analogue of transversal $C^{r-1}Z$ gates is given by the multiplication property, which requires component-wise products of classical codewords to belong to another similar code. As a byproduct of our techniques, we also obtain a new construction of classical locally testable codes with such a multiplication property.
  We construct our codes as products of chain complexes associated to classical LDPC codes, which in turn we obtain by imposing local Reed-Solomon codes on a specific spectral expander that we construct. We prove that our codes support the desired transversal $C^{r-1}Z$ gates by using the multiplication property to combine local circuits based on the topological structure.</description>

      <title>ActionReasoningBench: Reasoning about Actions with and without Ramification Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning about Actions and Change (RAC) has historically played a pivotal role in solving foundational AI problems, such as the frame problem. It has driven advancements in AI fields, such as non-monotonic and commonsense reasoning. RAC remains crucial for AI systems that operate in dynamic environments, engage in interactive scenarios, or rely on commonsense reasoning. Despite substantial advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various AI domains, their performance in RAC remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark, ActionReasoningBench, which encompasses 8 domains and includes questions for up to 19 action sequences. This benchmark rigorously evaluates LLMs across six key RAC dimensions: Fluent Tracking, State Tracking, Action Executability, Effects of Actions, Numerical RAC, and Composite Questions. LLMs demonstrate average accuracy rates of 73.55%, 65.63%, 58.73%, and 62.38% on the former four dimensions, which are frequently discussed in RAC literature. However, the performance on the latter two dimensions, which introduce complex and novel reasoning questions, the average performance of LLMs is lowered to 33.16% and 51.19%, respectively, reflecting a 17.9% performance decline. We also introduce new ramification constraints to capture the indirect effects of actions, providing deeper insights into RAC challenges. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-source and commercial models, reveals challenges across all RAC dimensions, particularly in handling ramifications, with GPT-4o failing to solve any question and o1-preview achieving a score of only 18.4%.</description>

      <title>The Rank-Ramsey Problem and the Log-Rank Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph is called Rank-Ramsey if (i) Its clique number is small, and (ii) The adjacency matrix of its complement has small rank. We initiate a systematic study of such graphs. Our main motivation is that their constructions, as well as proofs of their non-existence, are intimately related to the famous log-rank conjecture from the field of communication complexity. These investigations also open interesting new avenues in Ramsey theory.
  We construct two families of Rank-Ramsey graphs exhibiting polynomial separation between order and complement rank. Graphs in the first family have bounded clique number (as low as $41$). These are subgraphs of certain strong products, whose building blocks are derived from triangle-free strongly-regular graphs. Graphs in the second family are obtained by applying Boolean functions to Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Their clique number is logarithmic, but their complement rank is far smaller than in the first family, about $\mathcal{O}(n^{2/3})$. A key component of this construction is our matrix-theoretic view of lifts.
  We also consider lower bounds on the Rank-Ramsey numbers, and determine them in the range where the complement rank is $5$ or less. We consider connections between said numbers and other graph parameters, and find that the two best known explicit constructions of triangle-free Ramsey graphs turn out to be far from Rank-Ramsey.</description>
