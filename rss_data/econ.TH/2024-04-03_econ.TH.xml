      <title>Symmetric mechanisms for two-sided matching problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the basic one-to-one two-sided matching model, where there are two disjoint sets of agents of equal size, and each agent in a set has preferences on the agents in the other set, modelled by linear orders. The goal is to find a matching that associates each agent in one set with one and only one agent in the other set based on the agents' preferences. A mechanism is a rule that associates a set of matchings to each preference profile. Stability, which refers to the capability to select only stable matchings, is an important property a mechanism should fulfill. Another crucial property, especially useful for applications, is resoluteness, which requires that the mechanism always selects a unique matching. The two versions of the deferred acceptance algorithm are examples of stable and resolute mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are severely unfair since they strongly favor one of the two sides of the market. In this paper, we introduce a property that mechanisms may meet which relates to fairness. Such property, called symmetry, is formulated in a way able to capture different levels of fairness within and across the two sets of agents and generalize existing notions. We prove several possibility and impossibility results, mainly involving the most general notion of symmetry, known as gender fairness: among others, a resolute and gender fair mechanism exists if and only if each side of the market consists of an odd number of agents; there exists no resolute, stable and gender fair mechanism.</description>

      <title>Priority-Neutral Matching Lattices Are Not Distributive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable matchings are a cornerstone of market design, with numerous practical deployments backed by a rich, theoretically-tractable structure. However, in school-choice problems, stable matchings are not Pareto optimal for the students. Priority-neutral matchings, introduced by Reny (AER, 2022), generalizes the set of stable matchings by allowing for certain priority violations, and there is always a Pareto optimal priority-neutral matching. Moreover, like stable matchings, the set of priority-neutral matchings forms a lattice.
  We study the structure of the priority-neutral lattice. Unfortunately, we show that much of the simplicity of the stable matching lattice does not hold for the priority-neutral lattice. In particular, we show that the priority-neutral lattice need not be distributive. Moreover, we show that the greatest lower bound of two matchings in the priority-neutral lattice need not be their student-by-student minimum, answering an open question. This show that many widely-used properties of stable matchings fail for priority-neutral matchings; in particular, the set of priority-neutral matchings cannot be represented by via a partial ordering on a set of rotations. However, by proving a novel structural property of the set of priority-neutral matchings, we also show that not every lattice arises as a priority-neutral lattice, which suggests that the exact nature of the family of priority-neutral lattices may be subtle.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to nonlinear and non-smooth parabolic obstacle problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence, uniqueness, and $W^{1,2,p}$-regularity of solutions to fully nonlinear parabolic obstacle problems when the obstacle is the pointwise supremum of arbitrary functions in $W^{1,2,p}$ and the operator is only assumed to be measurable in the state and time variables. The results hold for a large class of non-smooth obstacles, including all convex obstacles. Applied to stopping problems, they imply that the decision maker never stops at a convex kink of the stopping payoff. The proof relies on new $W^{1,2,p}$-estimates for obstacle problems where the obstacle is the maximum of finitely many functions in $W^{1,2,p}$.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Deviator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A group of players are supposed to follow a prescribed profile of strategies. If they follow this profile, they will reach a given target. We show that if the target is not reached because some player deviates, then an outside observer can identify the deviator. We also construct identification methods in two nontrivial cases.</description>
