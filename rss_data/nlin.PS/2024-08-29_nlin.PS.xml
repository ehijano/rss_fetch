      <title>Dynamics of Nonlinear Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this topical review we explore the dynamics of nonlinear lattices with a particular focus to Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type models that arise in the study of elastic media and, more specifically, granular crystals. We first revisit the workhorse of such lattices, namely traveling waves, both from a continuum, but also from a genuinely discrete perspective, both without and with a linear force component (induced by the so-called precompression). We then extend considerations to time-periodic states, examining dark breather structures in homogeneous crystals, as well as bright breathers in diatomic lattices. The last pattern that we consider extensively is the dispersive shock wave arising in the context of suitable Riemann (step) initial data. We show how the use of continuum (KdV) and discrete (Toda) integrable approximations can be used to get a first quantitative handle of the relevant waveforms. In all cases, theoretical analysis is accompanied by numerical computations and, where possible, by a recap and illustration of prototypical experimental results. We close the chapter by offering a number of ongoing and potential future directions and associated open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>Aspect-ratio-dependent void formation in active rhomboidal and elliptical particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We execute a numerical simulation on active nematics with particles interacting by an excluded volume effect. The systems with rhomboidal particles and that with elliptical particles are considered in order to investigate the effect of the direct contact of particles. In our simulation, the void regions, where the local number density is almost zero, appear in both systems when the aspect ratio of the particles is high. We focused on the relationship between the void regions and the particle orientation of the bulk. The particle number density, particle orientation, topological defects, and void regions are analyzed for different aspect ratios in both systems. The systems with rhomboidal particles have characteristic void sizes, which increase with an increase in the aspect ratio. In contrast, the distribution of the void-region size in the systems with elliptical particles is broad. The present results suggest that the void size in the systems with rhomboidal particles is determined by the correlation length of the particle orientational field around the void regions, while that might be determined by the system size in the systems with elliptical particles.</description>

      <title>Stable developmental patterns of gene expression without morphogen gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gene expression patterns (GEPs) are established by cross-regulating target genes that interpret morphogen gradients. However, as development progresses, morphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent GEP without stabilizing positional cues. The GEP then can be deteriorated by the intrinsically noisy biochemical processes acting at the cellular level. However, the established GEPs remain spatio-temporally stable in many biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an enhanced sampling method (Non-Stationary Forward Flux Sampling) and a recently developed stability theory to address how spatiotemporal integrity of a GEP is maintained without morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model consisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a stripe pattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor domians alternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains, inspired by the gap gene system in the Drosophila embryo. We find that fine-tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level increases temporal stability of GEPs by orders of magnitude, providing stability over developmentally relevant times, without morphogen gradients. The numerically determined optimal parameter regime closely agrees with the predictions of the stability theory. By analizing the dynamics of GEP asymmetry factors, we trace back the pattern stability enhancement to the emergence of a metastable basin and restoring forces that counteract pattern perturbations. The origin of these forces is further explained by the effective model, describing the emergent deterministic dynamics of the system. Altogether, we show that metastable attractors can emerge as a property of stochastic GEPs even without system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory interactions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.</description>
