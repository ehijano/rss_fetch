      <title>First Resolution of Microlensed Images of a Binary-Lens Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the multiple images of the binary-lens microlensing event ASASSN-22av using the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The light curves show weak binary perturbations, complicating the analysis, but the joint modeling with the VLTI data breaks several degeneracies, arriving at a strongly favored solution. Thanks to precise measurements of angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.726 +/- 0.002 mas and microlens parallax, we determine that the lens system consists of two M dwarfs with masses of M_1 = 0.261 +/- 0.009 M_sun and M_2 = 0.252 +/- 0.017 M_sun, a projected separation of r_\perp = 7.42 +/- 0.33 AU and a distance of D_L = 2.31 +/- 0.09 kpc. The successful VLTI observations of ASASSN-22av open up a new path for studying intermediate-separation (i.e., a few AUs) stellar-mass binaries, including those containing dark compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>The $\delta$ Scuti stars of the Cep--Her Complex. I: Pulsator fraction, rotation, asteroseismic large spacings, and the $\nu_{\rm max}$ relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify delta Scuti pulsators amongst members of the recently-discovered Cep--Her Complex using light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We use Gaia colours and magnitudes to isolate a subsample of provisional Cep--Her members that are located in a narrow band on the colour--magnitude diagram compatible with the zero-age main sequence. The $\delta$ Sct pulsator fraction amongst these stars peaks at 100% and we describe a trend of higher pulsator fractions for younger stellar associations. We use four methods to measure the frequency of maximum amplitude or power, $\nu_{\rm max}$, to minimise methodological bias and we demonstrate their sound performance. The $\nu_{\rm max}$ measurements display a correlation with effective temperature, but with scatter that is too large for the relation to be useful. We find two ridges in the $\nu_{\rm max}$--$T_{\rm eff}$ diagram, one of which appears to be the result of rapid rotation causing stars to pulsate in low-order modes. We measure the $\nu_{\rm max}$ values of $\delta$ Sct stars in four other clusters or associations of similar age (Trumpler 10, the Pleiades, NGC 2516, and Praesepe) and find similar behaviour with $T_{\rm eff}$. Using \'echelle diagrams we measure the asteroseismic large spacing, $\Delta\nu$, for 70 stars, and find a correlation between $\Delta\nu$, rotation, and luminosity that allows rapid rotators seen at low inclinations to be distinguished from slow rotators. We find that rapid rotators are more likely than slow rotators to pulsate, but they do so with less regular pulsation patterns. We also investigate the reliability of Gaia's vbroad measurement for A-type stars, finding that it is mostly accurate but underestimates $v\sin i$ for slow rotators ($v\sin i &lt; 50$ km.s$^{-1}$) by 10--15%.</description>

      <title>Sakurai's object: a [WC] star in a new bipolar nebula after a VLTP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spectra of the Very Late Thermal Pulse (VLTP) object V4334 Sgr have shown a rapidly changing spectrum resulting from shocks in the outflow, which created a new bipolar nebula inside the old nebula. We see C II and C III emission lines emerging typical of a [WC 11-10]-type star. The strong increase of [O III] and [S III] emission lines indicate the possible onset of photoionisation in the new ejecta.</description>

      <title>Coronal heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal heating refers to the physical processes that shape and structure the corona of the Sun and are responsible for its multi-million Kelvin temperatures. These processes are revealed in a number of different observational manifestations and have been studied on theoretical grounds in great detail over the last eight decades. The aim of this Chapter is to give an account of some of those manifestations and to discuss relevant physics that we believe is responsible for them. Coronal heating is closely connected to other magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes occurring in the solar plasma and described in this book such as waves, shocks, instabilities, and magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Spectral resolution effects on the information content in solar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When interpreting spectropolarimetric observations of the solar atmosphere, wavelength variations of the emergent intensity and polarization translate into information on the depth stratification of physical parameters. We aim to quantify how the information content contained in a representative set of polarized spectra depends on the spectral resolution and spectral sampling. We use a state-of-the-art numerical simulation of a sunspot to synthesize polarized spectra of magnetically sensitive neutral iron lines. We then apply various degrees of spectral degradation to the synthetic spectra and analyze the impact on its dimensionality using PCA and wavelet decomposition. Finally, we apply the SIR code to the degraded synthetic data, to assess the effect of spectral resolution on the inferred parameters. We find that regions with strong magnetic fields where convection is suppressed produce less complex Stokes profiles. On the other hand, regions with strong gradients give rise to more complex Stokes profiles that are more affected by spectral degradation. The degradation also makes the inversion problem more ill-defined, so inversion models with a larger number of free parameters overfit and give wrong estimates. The impact of spectral degradation depends on multiple factors, including spectral resolution, noise level, line spread function (LSF) shape, complexity of the solar atmosphere, and the degrees of freedom in our inversion methods. Having a finely sampled spectrum may be more beneficial than achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio per wavelength bin. Considering the inclusion of different spectral lines that can counter these effects, and calibrating the effective degrees of freedom in modeling strategies, are also important considerations. These strategies are crucial for the accurate interpretation and have the potential to offer more cost-effective solutions.</description>

      <title>Running with the Bulls: The frequency of star-disc encounters in the Taurus star forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars and planets form in regions of enhanced stellar density, subjecting protoplanetary discs to gravitational perturbations from neighbouring stars. Observations in the Taurus star-forming have uncovered evidence of at least three recent, star-disc encounters that have truncated discs (HV/DO Tau, RW Aurigae, UX Tau), raising questions about the frequency of such events. We aim to assess the probability of observing truncating star-disc encounters in Taurus. We generate a physically motivated dynamical model including binaries and spatial-kinematic substructure to follow the historical dynamical evolution and stellar encounters in the Taurus star forming region. We track the star-disc encounters and outer disc radius evolution over the lifetime of Taurus. A quarter of discs are truncated below 30 au by dynamical encounters, but this truncation mostly occurs in binaries over the course of a few orbital periods, on a time-scale $\lesssim 0.1$ Myr. Nonetheless, some truncating encounters still occur up to the present age of Taurus. Strongly truncating encounters (ejecting $\gtrsim 10$ percent of the disc mass) occur at a rate $\sim 10$ Myr$^{-1}$, sufficient to explain the encounter between HV and DO Tau $\sim 0.1$ Myr ago. If encounters that eject only $\sim 1$ percent of the disc mass are responsible for RW Aurigae and UX Tau, then they are also expected with encounter rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{enc} \sim 100{-}200$ Myr$^{-1}$. However, the observed sample of recent encounters is probably incomplete, since these examples occurred in systems that are not consistent with random drawing from the mass function. One more observed example would statistically imply additional physics, such as replenishment of the outer disc material.</description>

      <title>Viewing the PLATO LOPS2 Field Through the Lenses of TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PLATO will begin observing stars in its Southern Field (LOPS2) after its launch in late 2026. By this time, TESS will have observed the stars in LOPS2 for at least four years. We find that by 2025, on average each star in the PLATO field will have been monitored for 330 days by TESS, with a subset of stars in the TESS continuous viewing zone having over 1000 days of monitoring. There are currently 96 known transiting exoplanets in the LOPS2 field, with 33 of these residing in multiplanet systems. The LOPS2 field also contains around 500 TESS planet candidate systems, over 1000 bright (V&lt;13) eclipsing binary systems, 6 transiting brown dwarf systems, and 2 bright white dwarfs (G&lt;13). We calculate TESS and PLATO sensitivities to detecting transits for the bright FGK stars that make up the PLATO LOPS2 P1 sample. We find that TESS should have discovered almost all transiting giant planets out to approximately 30 d within the LOPS2 field, and out to approximately 100 d for the regions of the LOPS2 field within the TESS CVZ ($\sim$20 per cent of the LOPS2 field). However, we find that for smaller radius planets in the range 1$-$4 R$_\oplus$ PLATO will have significantly better sensitivity, and these are likely to make up the bulk of new PLATO discoveries.</description>

      <title>Re examination of the effect of Pairing Gaps on Gamow Teller Strength Distributions and beta decay Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beta decay is one of the key factors to understand the r process and evolution of massive stars. The Gamow Teller (GT) transitions drive the beta decay process. We employ the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (on QRPA) model to calculate terrestrial and stellar beta decay rates for 50 top ranked nuclei possessing astrophysical significance according to a recent survey. The model parameters of the on QRPA model affect the predicted results of beta decay. The current study investigates the effect of nucleon nucleon pairing gaps on charge changing transitions and the associated beta decay rates. Three different values of pairing gaps, namely TF, 3TF and 5TF, were used in our investigation. It was concluded that both GT strength distributions and half lives are sensitive to pairing gap values. The 3TF pairing gap scheme, in our chosen nuclear model, resulted in best prediction with around 80 percent of the calculated half-lives within a factor 10 of the measured ones. The 3TF pairing scheme also led to calculation of biggest beta decay rates in stellar matter.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Systems: the Composition of Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We live in an exoplanet revolution, with more than 5,000 exoplanets detected to date. Our ability to characterise individual exoplanets is constantly improving, with exquisite mass and radius measurements for an ever-growing sample of planets, complimented by atmospheric characterisation of lower and lower mass planets. This chapter outlines a complimentary set of observations that uniquely provide bulk elemental compositions for exoplanetary material. Absorption features from metals, including Mg, Fe, Si, O, Ca, Al, Ni and Ti in the white dwarf photosphere characterise the composition of accreted planetary material. These observations highlight the diversity in composition across exoplanetary systems including volatile content and probe key geological processes including the formation of iron cores. Thanks to the many white dwarfs identified by the space satellite {\it Gaia}, a revolution in the spectroscopic characterisation of white dwarfs is underway.</description>

      <title>Cleaning WASP-33 b transits from the host star photometric variability: analysis of TESS data from two sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on TESS observations of a $\delta$ Scuti variable WASP-33 obtained in 2019 and 2022, we thoroughly investigate the power spectrum of this target photometric flux and construct a statistically exhaustive model for its variability. This model contains $30$ robustly justified harmonics detected in the both TESS sectors simultaneously, $13$ less robust harmonics detected in a single TESS sector, a red noise and a quasiperiodic noise terms. This allowed us to greatly improve the accuracy of the exoplanet WASP-33 b transit timings, reducing the TTV residuals r.m.s. drastically, by a factor of $3.5$, from $63$ s to $18$ s. Finally, our analysis does not confirm existence of a detectable orbital phase variation claimed by von Essen et al. (2020) based on WASP-33 TESS photometry of 2019.</description>

      <title>Investigating C-Doop vibrational modes in PAHs as a tool to study interstellar deuterium-containing PAHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAHs-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative way is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated or deuteronated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out of plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes belonging to PAHs with single to multiple deuteration in the same ring are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. We found that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at 14-19 micron range, which does not overlap with the region attributed to C-Hoop modes. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to D/H in PAHs. In addition, new C-Hoop modes also appear due to the creation of new C-H bonds upon deuteration of duet, trio, and quartet C-H sites. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric modeling of interacting Type II supernovae. Application to early-time observations of SN1998S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-cadence surveys of the sky are revealing that a large fraction of red-supergiant (RSG) stars, which are progenitors of Type II-Plateau (II-P) supernovae (SNe), explode within circumstellar material (CSM). Such SNe II-P/CSM exhibit considerable diversity, with interaction signatures lasting from hours to days, potentially merging with the Type IIn subclass for which longer-duration interaction typically occurs. To tackle this growing sample of transients and to understand the pre-SN mass loss histories of RSGs, we train on the highest quality, spectropolarimetric observations of a young Type IIn SN taken to date: Those of SN1998S at ~5d after explosion. We design an approach based on a combination of radiation hydrodynamics with HERACLES and polarized radiative transfer with CMFGEN and LONG_POL. The adopted asymmetries are based on a latitudinal, depth- and time-independent, scaling of the density of 1D models of SNe II-P/CSM (e.g., model r1w6b with a `wind' mass-loss rate of 0.01Msun/yr used for SN2023ixf). For a pole-to-equator density ratio of five, we find that the polarization reaches, and then remains for days, at a maximum value of 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8% as the CSM extent is changed from 6, to 8 and 10x10^14cm. The polarization is independent of wavelength away from funnel-shaped depolarizations within emission lines. Our models implicate a significant depolarization at line cores, which we use to constrain the interstellar polarization of SN1998S. Our 2D, prolate ejecta models with moderate asymmetry match well the spectropolarimetric observations of SN1998S at 5d, supporting a polarization level of about ~2%. This study provides a framework for interpreting future spectropolarimetric observations of SNe II-P/CSM and SNe IIn and fostering a better understanding of the origin of their pre-SN mass loss.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Glycolaldehyde, Methyl Formate, and Acetic Acid. II. Chemical Modeling of the Bimodal Abundance Pattern in NGC 6334I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas-phase abundance ratios between \ce{C2H4O2} isomers methyl formate (MF), glycolaldehyde (GA), and acetic acid (AA) are typically on the order of 100:10:1 in star-forming regions. However, an unexplained divergence from this neat relationship was recently observed towards a collection of sources in the massive protocluster NGC 6334I; some sources exhibited extreme MF:GA ratios, producing a bimodal behavior between different sources, while the MF:AA ratio remained stable. Here, we use a three-phase gas-grain hot-core chemical model to study the effects of a large parameter space on the simulated \ce{C2H4O2} abundances. A combination of high gas densities and long timescales during ice-mantle desorption ($\sim$125--160~K) appears to be the physical cause of the high MF:GA ratios. The main chemical mechanism for GA destruction occurring under these conditions is the rapid adsorption and reaction of atomic H with GA on the ice surfaces before it has time to desorb. The different binding energies of MF and GA on water ice are crucial to the selectivity of the surface destruction mechanism; individual MF molecules rapidly escape the surface when exposed by water loss, while GA lingers and is destroyed by H. Moderately elevated cosmic-ray ionization rates can increase absolute levels of COM production in the ices and increase the MF:GA ratio, but extreme values are destructive for gas-phase COMs. We speculate that the high densities required for extreme MF:GA ratios could be evidence of COM emission dominated by COMs desorbing within a circumstellar disk.</description>

      <title>No Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently claimed (arXiv:2405.05410 [gr-qc]) that evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays can be attributed instead to random perturbations of the Sun's motion by transiting asteroids. I show that that this would lead to a large dipole component accompanying a much smaller quadrupolar perturbation of pulsar timing signals, which would not be confused with a gravitational wave signal. Such an anomalous dipole would have been detected and identified as a spurious background by the PTA collaborations, if it existed.</description>

      <title>Finding the unusual red giant remnants of cataclysmic variable mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mergers between helium white dwarfs and main-sequence stars are likely common, producing red giant-like remnants making up roughly a few percent of all low-mass ($\lesssim2M_\odot$) red giants. Through detailed modeling, we show that these merger remnants possess distinctive photometric, asteroseismic, and surface abundance signatures through which they may be identified. During hydrogen shell burning, merger remnants reach higher luminosities and possess pulsations which depart from the usual degenerate sequence on the asteroseismic $\Delta\nu$--$\Delta\Pi$ diagram for red giant branch stars. For sufficiently massive helium white dwarfs, merger remnants undergo especially violent helium flashes which can dredge up a large amount of core material (up to $\sim0.1M_\odot$) into the envelope. Such post-dredge-up remnants are more luminous than normal red clump stars, are surface carbon-, helium-, and possibly lithium-rich, and possess a wider range of asteroseismic g-mode period spacings and mixed-mode couplings. Recent asteroseismically determined low-mass ($\lesssim0.8M_\odot$) red clump stars may be core helium-burning remnants of mergers involving lower-mass helium white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- IV. GTC/OSIRIS optical spectra of Gaia late-M and L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of our comprehensive, ongoing characterisation of the low-mass end of the main sequence in the Solar neighbourhood, we used the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias to acquire low- and mid-resolution (R$\approx$300 and R$\approx$2500) optical spectroscopy of 53 late-M and L ultracool dwarfs. Most of these objects are known but poorly investigated and lacking complete kinematics. We measured spectral indices, determined spectral types (six of which are new) and inferred effective temperature and surface gravity from BT-Settl synthetic spectra fits for all objects. We were able to measure radial velocities via line centre fitting and cross correlation for 46 objects, 29 of which lacked previous radial velocity measurements. Using these radial velocities in combination with the latest Gaia DR3 data, we also calculated Galactocentric space velocities. From their kinematics, we identified two candidates outside of the thin disc and four in young stellar kinematic groups. Two further ultracool dwarfs are apparently young field objects: 2MASSW J1246467$+$402715 (L4$\beta$), which has a potential, weak lithium absorption line, and G 196$-$3B (L3$\beta$), which was already known as young due to its well-studied primary companion.</description>

      <title>Active and sterile neutrino oscillations inside the Sun in a phenomenological (3+1+2)-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5817</link>
      <description>arXiv:1310.5817v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phenomenological model with three active and three light sterile neutrinos is considered taking into account terrestrial experimental data, which indicate anomalies at short distances beyond the minimally modified Standard Model with three massive active neutrinos. One of the sterile neutrinos is assumed to have distinctly different mass in comparison with masses of two others, that is corresponding to a $(3+1+2)$-model of neutrinos. Model parameters values used for the description of oscillations of both active and sterile massive neutrinos into the Sun are chosen. Oscillation characteristics of solar neutrinos together with sterile neutrinos contributions have been evaluated taking into account the neutrino interaction with the matter inside the Sun with the use of the standard solar model (SSM). Results obtained correlate with observational data and can be used for development of sterile neutrinos models.</description>

      <title>Identifying Light-curve Signals with a Deep Learning Based Object Detection Algorithm. II. A General Light Curve Classification Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vast amounts of astronomical photometric data are generated from various projects, requiring significant effort to identify variable stars and other object classes. In light of this, a general, widely applicable classification framework would simplify the process of designing specific classifiers for various astronomical objects. We present a novel deep learning framework for classifying light curves using a weakly supervised object detection model. Our framework identifies the optimal windows for both light curves and power spectra automatically, and zooms in on their corresponding data. This allows for automatic feature extraction from both time and frequency domains, enabling our model to handle data across different scales and sampling intervals. We train our model on data sets obtained from Kepler, TESS, and Zwicky Transient Facility multiband observations of variable stars and transients. We achieve an accuracy of 87% for combined variables and transient events, which is comparable to the performance of previous feature-based models. Our trained model can be utilized directly for other missions, such as the All-sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning. To address known issues with miscalibrated predictive probabilities, we apply conformal prediction to generate robust predictive sets that guarantee true-label coverage with a given probability. Additionally, we incorporate various anomaly detection algorithms to empower our model with the ability to identify out-of-distribution objects. Our framework is implemented in the Deep-LC toolkit, which is an open-source Python package hosted on Github (https://github.com/ckm3/Deep-LC) and PyPI.</description>

      <title>SN2023fyq: A Type Ibn Supernova With Long-standing Precursor Activity Due to Binary Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2023fyq, a type Ibn supernova in the nearby galaxy NGC 4388 (D$\simeq$18~Mpc). In addition, we trace long-standing precursor emission at the position of SN 2023fyq using data from DLT40, ATLAS, ZTF, ASAS-SN, Swift, and amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki. Precursor activity is observed up to nearly three years before the supernova explosion, with a relatively rapid rise in the final 100 days. The double-peaked post-explosion light curve reaches a luminosity of $\sim10^{43}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. The strong intermediate-width He lines observed in the nebular spectrum of SN 2023fyq imply the interaction is still active at late phases. We found that the precursor activity in SN 2023fyq is best explained by the mass transfer in a binary system involving a low-mass He star and a compact companion. An equatorial disk is likely formed in this process ($\sim$0.6$\rm M_{\odot}$), and the interaction of SN ejecta with this disk powers the main peak of the supernova. The early SN light curve reveals the presence of dense extended material ($\sim$0.3$\rm M_{\odot}$) at $\sim$3000$\rm R_{\odot}$ ejected weeks before the SN explosion, likely due to final-stage core silicon burning or runaway mass transfer resulting from binary orbital shrinking, leading to rapid rising precursor emission within $\sim$30 days prior to explosion. The final explosion could be triggered either by the core-collapse of the He star or by the merger of the He star with a compact object. SN 2023fyq, along with SN 2018gjx and SN 2015G, forms a unique class of Type Ibn SNe which originate in binary systems and are likely to exhibit detectable long-lasting pre-explosion outbursts with magnitudes ranging from $-$10 to $-$13.</description>
