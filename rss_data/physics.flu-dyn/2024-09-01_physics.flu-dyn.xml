      <title>Efficient Transonic Aeroelastic Model Reduction Using Optimized Sparse Multi-Input Polynomial Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear aeroelastic reduced-order models (ROMs) based on machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms can be complex and computationally demanding to train, meaning that for practical aeroelastic applications, the conservative nature of linearization is often favored. Therefore, there is a requirement for novel nonlinear aeroelastic model reduction approaches that are accurate, simple and, most importantly, efficient to generate. This paper proposes a novel formulation for the identification of a compact multi-input Volterra series, where Orthogonal Matching Pursuit is used to obtain a set of optimally sparse nonlinear multi-input ROM coefficients from unsteady aerodynamic training data. The framework is exemplified using the Benchmark Supercritical Wing, considering; forced response, flutter and limit cycle oscillation. The simple and efficient Optimal Sparsity Multi-Input ROM (OSM-ROM) framework performs with high accuracy compared to the full-order aeroelastic model, requiring only a fraction of the tens-of-thousands of possible multi-input terms to be identified and allowing a 96% reduction in the number of training samples.</description>

      <title>Fully Coupled Implicit Hydro-Mechanical Multiphase Flow Simulation in Deformable Porous Media Using DEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of multiphase flow dynamics in porous media is crucial for optimizing subsurface engineering applications like geological carbon sequestration. However, studying the micro-mechanisms of multiphase fluid--grain interactions in the laboratory is challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining mechanical data such as force and displacement. Transitional discrete element method models coupled with pore networks offer insights into these interactions but struggle with accurate pressure prediction during pore expansion from fracturing and efficient simulation during the slow drainage of compressible fluids. To address these limitations, we develop an advanced two-way coupled hydro-mechanical discrete element method model that accurately and efficiently captures fluid--fluid and fluid--grain interactions in deformable porous media. Our model integrates an unconditionally stable implicit finite volume approach, enabling significant timesteps for advancing fluids. A pressure-volume iteration scheme dynamically balances injection-induced pressure buildup with substantial pore structure deformation, while flow front-advancing criteria precisely locate the fluid--fluid interface and adaptively refine timesteps, particularly when capillary effects block potential flow paths. The model is validated against benchmark Hele-Shaw experiments in both rigid and deformable porous media, providing quantitative insights into the micro-mechanisms governing multiphase flow. For the first time, grain-scale inputs such as viscous and capillary pressures, energies, contact forces, and flow resistances are utilized to provide a detailed understanding of micro-scale fluid--fluid and fluid--grain flow patterns and their transitions.</description>

      <title>Droplet size and velocity measurements in a cryogenic jet flame of a rocket-type combustor using high speed imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injectors of cryogenic liquid rocket engines produce large polydisperse and dense sprays due to the pressure and mass flow conditions. Atomization is the dominating process that drives the flame behaviour in cryogenic jet flames, when the propellants are injected in subcritical conditions. The main objective of this study is the characterization of a liquid oxygen (LOX) spray in gaseous hydrogen (GH2), in reacting conditions. In the breakup region where liquid particles are not spherical, laser based drop size techniques suffer from a low validation data rate, thus imaging techniques can be better suited to characterize the spray. High speed shadowgraphs were used to provide the spray characteristics such as sizes and velocities of the LOX dispersed phase atomized by a GH2 co-flow injected by a shear coaxial injector in a 1MPa combustion chamber. Cryogenic combustion investigations presented in this paper were carried out on the Mascotte test bench, at Onera. The reacting case was compared qualitatively to a cold flow test, with gaseous He instead of GH2, for which LOX spray shadowgraphs were also recorded. Velocity of the dispersed phase in reacting conditions was obtained with two different imaging methods, which were applied to the same shadowgraphs: a PTV algorithm and a PIV software, developed at Onera. Droplet sizes were measured by image processing in the atomization zone and results were compared with Sauter mean diameters obtained with phase Doppler measurements from the literature. The droplet size is combined with PTV to obtain droplet size/velocity correlations which show the influence of the flame on the droplet size evolution.</description>

      <title>Equation identification for fluid flows via physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) methods such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are used to estimate parameters of interest from governing equations and small quantities of data. However, there has been little work in assessing how well PINNs perform for inverse problems across wide ranges of governing equations across the mathematical sciences. We present a new and challenging benchmark problem for inverse PINNs based on a parametric sweep of the 2D Burgers' equation with rotational flow. We show that a novel strategy that alternates between first- and second-order optimization proves superior to typical first-order strategies for estimating parameters. In addition, we propose a novel data-driven method to characterize PINN effectiveness in the inverse setting. PINNs' physics-informed regularization enables them to leverage small quantities of data more efficiently than the data-driven baseline. However, both PINNs and the baseline can fail to recover parameters for highly inviscid flows, motivating the need for further development of PINN methods.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the discovery of steady-states of planetary interior dynamics with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating mantle convection often requires reaching a computationally expensive steady-state, crucial for deriving scaling laws for thermal and dynamical flow properties and benchmarking numerical solutions. The strong temperature dependence of the rheology of mantle rocks causes viscosity variations of several orders of magnitude, leading to a slow-evolving stagnant lid where heat conduction dominates, overlying a rapidly-evolving and strongly convecting region. Time-stepping methods, while effective for fluids with constant viscosity, are hindered by the Courant criterion, which restricts the time step based on the system's maximum velocity and grid size. Consequently, achieving steady-state requires a large number of time steps due to the disparate time scales governing the stagnant and convecting regions.
  We present a concept for accelerating mantle convection simulations using machine learning. We generate a dataset of 128 two-dimensional simulations with mixed basal and internal heating, and pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity. We train a feedforward neural network on 97 simulations to predict steady-state temperature profiles. These can then be used to initialize numerical time stepping methods for different simulation parameters. Compared to typical initializations, the number of time steps required to reach steady-state is reduced by a median factor of 3.75. The benefit of this method lies in requiring very few simulations to train on, providing a solution with no prediction error as we initialize a numerical method, and posing minimal computational overhead at inference time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and discuss the potential implications for accelerated simulations for advancing mantle convection research.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Transonic Flows around an Airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have gained popularity as a deep-learning based method for solving problems governed by partial differential equations. Especially for engineering applications, this new method seems to be promising since it can solve parametric problems. Therefore, a single neural network could substitute many classical simulations in parameter studies. The simulation of inviscid, compressible flows around an airfoil, has been a challenging task for classical numerical methods for many decades and is relevant for industrial applications to this day. Only recently, researchers have been able to successfully simulate subsonic flows around an airfoil with physics-informed neural networks by utilizing mesh transformations to precondition the optimization problem that needs to be solved. Here, we extend this methodology into the transonic regime. Previous attempts showed difficulties to capture the normal shock waves that occur at these flow conditions. Inspired by classical numerical methods, we introduce an analytic sensor function that locally introduces artificial viscosity at the shock locations to stabilize the training process. We validate the method at different transonic flow conditions for the NACA0012 airfoil, obtaining errors of less than one percent, compared to finite volume simulations. In addition we show how a parametric model can approximate the solution in a continuous range of angle of attacks. The presented method could help to pave the way for physics-informed neural networks towards industrial applications in aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Stability of Partially and Fully Saturated Atmospheres to Moist Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a linear analysis of a minimal model of moist convection under a variety of atmospheric conditions. The stationary solutions that we analyze include both fully saturated and partially unsaturated atmospheres in both unconditionally and conditionally unstable cases. We find that all of the solutions we consider are linearly unstable via exchange of stability when sufficiently driven. The critical Rayleigh numbers vary by over an order of magnitude between unconditionally unstable and conditionally unstable atmospheres. The unsaturated atmospheres are notable for the presence of linear gravity wave-like oscillations even in unstable conditions. We study their eigenfunction structure and find that the buoyancy and moisture perturbations are anticorrelated in $z$, such that regions of negative buoyancy have positive moisture content. We suggest that these features in unsaturated atmospheres may explain the phenomenon of gravity wave shedding by moist convective plumes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article is devoted to the study of the dynamics of narrowband wave fields within the non-integrable Schamel equation, which plays an important role in plasma physics, wave dynamics in metamaterials, and electrical circuits. A Monte Carlo approach is used to obtain a large number of random independent realizations of the wave fields, allowing for an investigation of the evolution of the following statistical characteristics: spectra, moments, and distribution functions. The simulations are conducted for different values of the Ursell number (the ratio of nonlinearity to dispersion) to study the impact of nonlinearity and dispersion on the processes under consideration.</description>

      <title>Neural network-based closure models for large-eddy simulations with explicit filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows are commonly used to train neural network-based models as subgrid closures for large-eddy simulations; however, models with low a priori accuracy have been observed to fortuitously provide better a posteriori results than models with high a priori accuracy. This anomaly can be traced to a dataset shift in the learning problem, arising from inconsistent filtering in the training and testing stages. We propose a resolution to this issue that uses explicit filtering of the nonlinear advection term in the large-eddy simulation momentum equations to control aliasing errors. Within the context of explicitly-filtered large-eddy simulations, we develop neural network-based models for which a priori accuracy is a good predictor of a posteriori performance. We evaluate the proposed method in a large-eddy simulation of a turbulent flow in a plane channel at $Re_{\tau} = 180$. Our findings show that an explicitly-filtered large-eddy simulation with a filter-to-grid ratio of 2 sufficiently controls the numerical errors so as to allow for accurate and stable simulations.</description>

      <title>Turbulent mixing controls fixation of growing antagonistic populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike coffee and cream that homogenize when stirred, growing micro-organisms (e.g., bacteria, baker's yeast) can actively kill each other and avoid mixing. How do such antagonistic interactions impact the growth and survival of competing strains, while being spatially advected by turbulent flows? By using numerical simulations of a continuum model, we study the dynamics of two antagonistic strains that are dispersed by incompressible turbulent flows in two spatial dimensions. A key parameter is the ratio of the fluid transport time to that of biological reproduction, which determines the winning strain that ultimately takes over the whole population from an initial heterogeneous state. By quantifying the probability and mean time for fixation along with the spatial structure of concentration fluctuations, we demonstrate how turbulence raises the threshold for biological nucleation and antagonism suppresses flow-induced mixing by depleting the population at interfaces. Our work highlights the unusual biological consequences of the interplay of turbulent fluid flows with antagonistic population dynamics, with potential implications for marine microbial ecology and origins of biological chirality.</description>

      <title>Dynamic cost allocation allows network-forming forager to switch between search strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network-forming organisms, like fungi and slime molds, dynamically reorganize their networks during foraging. The resulting re-routing of resource flows within the organism's network can significantly impact local ecosystems. In current analysis limitations stem from a focus on single-time-point morphology, hindering understanding of continuous dynamics and underlying constraints. Here, we study ongoing network reorganization in the foraging slime mold \textit{Physarum~polycephalum}, identifying three distinct states with varying morphology and migration velocity. We estimate the energetic cost of each state and find a trade-off between building and transport costs within the morphological variability, facilitating different search strategies. Adaptation of state population to the environment suggests that diverse network morphologies support varied foraging strategies, though constrained by associated costs. Our findings provide insights for evaluating the impact of resource flow re-routing in changing ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov spectra and fluctuation relations: Insights from the Galerkin-truncated Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imposition of a global constraint of the conservation of total kinetic energy on a forced-dissipative Burgers equation yields a governing equation that is invariant under the time-reversal symmetry operation, $\{\mathcal{T}: t \to -t; u \to -u \}$, where $u$ is the velocity field. Moreover, the dissipation term gets strongly modified, as the viscosity is no longer a constant, but a fluctuating, state dependent quantity, which can even become negative in certain dynamical regimes. Despite these differences, the statistical properties of different dynamical regimes of the time-reversible Burgers equation and the standard forced-dssipative Burgers equation are equivalent, \`a la Gallavotti's conjecture of \textit{equivalence of nonequilibrium ensembles}. We show that the negative viscosity events occur only in the thermalized regime described by the time-reversible equation. This quasi-equilibrium regime is examined by calculating the local Lyapunov spectra and fluctuation relations. A pairing symmetry among the spectra is observed, indicating that the dynamics is chaotic and has an attractor spanning the entire phase space of the system. The violations of the second law of thermodynamics are found to be in accordance with the fluctuation relations, namely the Gallavotti-Cohen relation based on the phase-space contraction rate and the Cohen-Searles fluctuation relation based on the energy production rate. It is also argued that these violations are associated with the effects of the Galerkin-truncation, the latter is responsible for the thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the mean profiles of temperature (modeled as a passive scalar) in forced turbulent convection, as a function of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. The derivation leverages on the observed universality of the inner-layer thermal eddy diffusivity with respect to Reynolds and Prandtl number variations and across different flows, and on universality of the passive scalar defect in the core flow. Matching of the inner- and outer-layer expression yields a smooth compound mean temperature profile. We find excellent agreement of the analytical profile with data from direct numerical simulations of pipe and channel flows under various thermal forcing conditions, and over a wide range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>Potential for damage to fruits during transport through cross-section constrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fruit preparations are used in various forms in the food industry. For example, they are used as an ingredient in dairy products such as yogurt with added fruit. The dispersed fruit pieces can be described as soft particles with viscoelastic material behavior. The continuous phase is represented by fluids with complex flow behavior depending on the formulation. Characterization has shown that this can be described by the Herschel-Bulkley model. Since damage to fruit pieces is undesirable in industrial transport processes, the potential for damage to fruit pieces during transport of pipes in cross-sectional constrictions is analyzed. The analysis is performed numerically using the homogenized lattice Boltzmann method and validated by an experiment on industrial fruit preparations at pilot plant scale. The results show a strong dependence of the damage potential on the (local) Metzner-Reed Reynolds number.</description>

Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>
