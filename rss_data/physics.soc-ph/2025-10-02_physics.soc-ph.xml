      <title>Increasing accessibility by public transport benefits local economy: the effect of a new metro line in Rome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the economic impact of Metro C, a major expansion of Rome's metro system. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach within a multiplicative framework, the research quantifies the impact of increased accessibility on local economic activities. The results show a statistically significant rise in the number of economic activities in areas affected by the new line. A mild decline in economic diversity suggests the emergence of spatial clustering of similar activities. A dedicated analysis of microenterprises, which represent the majority of the dataset, examines changes in employment and GDP associated with the new infrastructure. The observed zone-level correlation between accessibility gains and growth in economic activities also offers a basis for generalising the findings beyond the specific case of Metro C. Overall, the case study shows that public transport investments aimed at boosting sustainable mobility can also generate positive spillover effects on the local economic fabric.</description>

      <title>The centripetal pull of climate: Evidence from European Parliament elections (1989-2019)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of temperature shocks on European Parliament elections. We combine high-resolution climate data with results from parliamentary elections between 1989 and 2019, aggregated at the NUTS-2 regional level. Exploiting exogenous variation in unusually warm and hot days during the months preceding elections, we identify the effect of short-run temperature shocks on voting behaviour. We find that temperature shocks reduce ideological polarisation and increase vote concentration, as voters consolidate around larger, more moderate parties. This aggregated pattern is explained by a gain in support of liberal and, to a lesser extent, social democratic parties, while right-wing parties lose vote share. Consistent with a salience mechanism, complementary analysis of party manifestos shows greater emphasis on climate-related issues in warmer pre-electoral contexts. Overall, our findings indicate that climate shocks can shift party systems toward the centre and weaken political extremes.</description>

      <title>Framing Unionization on Facebook: Communication around Representation Elections in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital media have become central to how labor unions communicate, organize, and sustain collective action. Yet little is known about how unions' online discourse relates to concrete outcomes such as representation elections. This study addresses the gap by combining National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election data with 158k Facebook posts published by U.S. labor unions between 2015 and 2024. We focused on five discourse frames widely recognized in labor and social movement communication research: diagnostic (identifying problems), prognostic (proposing solutions), motivational (mobilizing action), community (emphasizing solidarity), and engagement (promoting interaction). Using a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier, we systematically annotated unions' posts and analyzed patterns of frame usage around election events. Our findings showed that diagnostic and community frames dominated union communication overall, but that frame usage varied substantially across organizations. In election cases that unions won, communication leading up to the vote showed an increased use of diagnostic, prognostic, and community frames, followed by a reduction in prognostic and motivational framing after the event--patterns consistent with strategic preparation. By contrast, in lost election cases unions showed little adjustment in their communication, suggesting an absence of tailored communication strategies. By examining variation in message-level framing, the study highlights how communication strategies adapt to organizational contexts, contributing open tools and data and complementing prior research in understanding digital communication of unions and social movements.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Node Embeddings for Graph Modeling and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lying at the interface between Network Science and Machine Learning, node embedding algorithms take a graph as input and encode its structure onto output vectors that represent nodes in an abstract geometric space, enabling various vector-based downstream tasks such as network modelling, data compression, link prediction, and community detection. Two apparently unrelated limitations affect these algorithms. On one hand, it is not clear what the basic operation defining vector spaces, i.e. the vector sum, corresponds to in terms of the original nodes in the network. On the other hand, while the same input network can be represented at multiple levels of resolution by coarse-graining the constituent nodes into arbitrary block-nodes, the relationship between node embeddings obtained at different hierarchical levels is not understood. Here, building on recent results in network renormalization theory, we address these two limitations at once and define a multiscale node embedding method that, upon arbitrary coarse-grainings, ensures statistical consistency of the embedding vector of a block-node with the sum of the embedding vectors of its constituent nodes. We illustrate the power of this approach on two economic networks that can be naturally represented at multiple resolution levels: namely, the international trade between (sets of) countries and the input-output flows among (sets of) industries in the Netherlands. We confirm the statistical consistency between networks retrieved from coarse-grained node vectors and networks retrieved from sums of fine-grained node vectors, a result that cannot be achieved by alternative methods. Several key network properties, including a large number of triangles, are successfully replicated already from embeddings of very low dimensionality, allowing for the generation of faithful replicas of the original networks at arbitrary resolution levels.</description>

      <title>A Synthetic Theory of Socio-Epistemic Structuration: Capital, Ideology, and Agency in the Age of Digital Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a synthetic theory of socio-epistemic structuration to understand the reproduction of inequality in contemporary societies. I argue that social reality is not only determined by material structures and social networks but is fundamentally shaped by the epistemic frameworks -- ideologies, narratives, and attributions of agency -- that mediate actors' engagement with their environment. The theory integrates findings from critical race theory, network sociology, social capital studies, historical sociology, and analyses of emerging AI agency. I analyze how structures (from the ``racial contract'' to Facebook networks) and epistemic frameworks (from racist ideology to personal culture) mutually reinforce one another, creating resilient yet unequal life trajectories. Using data from large-scale experiments like the Moving to Opportunity and social network analyses, I demonstrate that exposure to diverse environments and social capital is a necessary but insufficient condition for social mobility; epistemic friction, manifested as `friending bias' and persistent cultural frameworks, systematically limits the benefits of such exposure. I conclude that a public and methodologically reflexive sociology must focus on unpacking and challenging these epistemic structures, recognizing the theoretical capacity of subaltern publics (``reverse tutelage'') and developing new methods to disentangle the complex interplay of homophily, contagion, and structural causation in a world of big data.</description>

      <title>Campaign-spending driven polarization transition in a double-random field model of elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model bipartisan elections where voters are exposed to two forces: local homophilic interactions and external influence from two political campaigns. The model is mathematically equivalent to the random field Ising model with a bimodal field. When both parties exceed a critical campaign spending, the system undergoes a phase transition to a highly polarized state where homophilic influence becomes negligible, and election outcomes mirror the proportion of voters aligned with each campaign, independent of total spending. The model predicts a hysteresis region, where the election results are not determined by campaign spending but by incumbency. Calibrating the model with historical data from US House elections between 1980 and 2020, we find the critical campaign spending to be $\sim 1.8$ million USD. Campaigns exceeding critical expenditures increased in 2018 and 2020, suggesting a boost in political polarization.</description>

      <title>How to optimise tournament draws: The case of the FIFA World Cup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The organisers of major sports competitions use different policies with respect to constraints in the group draw. Our paper aims to rationalise these choices by analysing the trade-off between attractiveness (the number of games played by teams from the same geographic zone) and fairness (the departure of the draw mechanism from a uniform distribution). A parametric optimisation model is formulated and applied to the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup draws. A flaw of the draw procedure is identified: the pre-assignment of the host to a group unnecessarily increases the distortions. All Pareto efficient sets of draw constraints are determined via simulations. The proposed framework can be used to find the optimal draw rules and justify the non-uniformity of the draw procedure for the stakeholders.</description>
