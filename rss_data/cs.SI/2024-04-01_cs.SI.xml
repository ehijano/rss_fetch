      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often fall short when confronted with the growing challenges of today. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into \textit{Neural Models} and \textit{Hybrid Models}. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>

      <title>Keeping Up With the Winner! Targeted Advertisement to Communities in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a new product enters a market already dominated by an existing product, will it survive along with this dominant product? Most of the existing works have shown the coexistence of two competing products spreading/being adopted on overlaid graphs with same set of users. However, when it comes to the survival of a weaker product on the same graph, it has been established that the stronger one dominates the market and wipes out the other. This paper makes a step towards narrowing this gap so that a new/weaker product can also survive along with its competitor with a positive market share. Specifically, we identify a locally optimal set of users to induce a community that is targeted with advertisement by the product launching company under a given budget constraint. To this end, we model the system as competing Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemics and employ perturbation techniques to quantify and attain a positive market share in a cost-efficient manner. Our extensive simulation results with real-world graph dataset show that with our choice of target users, a new product can establish itself with positive market share, which otherwise would be dominated and eventually wiped out of the competitive market under the same budget constraint.</description>

      <title>Measuring Online Emotional Reactions to Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich and dynamic information environment of social media provides researchers, policy makers, and entrepreneurs with opportunities to learn about social phenomena in a timely manner. However, using this data to understand social behavior is difficult due heterogeneity of topics and events discussed in the highly dynamic online information environment. To address these challenges, we present a method for systematically detecting and measuring emotional reactions to offline events using change point detection on the time series of collective affect, and further explaining these reactions using a transformer-based topic model. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a corpus of tweets from a large US metropolitan area between January and August, 2020, covering a period of great social change. We demonstrate that our method is able to disaggregate topics to measure population's emotional and moral reactions. This capability allows for better monitoring of population's reactions during crises using online data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Unsupervised Community Search with Pre-trained Graph Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community search has aroused widespread interest in the past decades. Among existing solutions, the learning-based models exhibit outstanding performance in terms of accuracy by leveraging labels to 1) train the model for community score learning, and 2) select the optimal threshold for community identification. However, labeled data are not always available in real-world scenarios. To address this notable limitation of learning-based models, we propose a pre-trained graph Transformer based community search framework that uses Zero label (i.e., unsupervised), termed TransZero. TransZero has two key phases, i.e., the offline pre-training phase and the online search phase. Specifically, in the offline pretraining phase, we design an efficient and effective community search graph transformer (CSGphormer) to learn node representation. To pre-train CSGphormer without the usage of labels, we introduce two self-supervised losses, i.e., personalization loss and link loss, motivated by the inherent uniqueness of node and graph topology, respectively. In the online search phase, with the representation learned by the pre-trained CSGphormer, we compute the community score without using labels by measuring the similarity of representations between the query nodes and the nodes in the graph. To free the framework from the usage of a label-based threshold, we define a new function named expected score gain to guide the community identification process. Furthermore, we propose two efficient and effective algorithms for the community identification process that run without the usage of labels. Extensive experiments over 10 public datasets illustrate the superior performance of TransZero regarding both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>An Approach for Addressing Internally-Disconnected Communities in Louvain Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11454v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of identifying densely connected clusters of nodes within a network. The Louvain algorithm is a widely used method for this task, but it can produce communities that are internally disconnected. To address this, the Leiden algorithm was introduced. In this technical report, we propose another approach to mitigate this issue. On a system with two 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, our new parallel algorithm GSP-Louvain, based on the Louvain algorithm, addresses this issue, and outperforms the original Leiden, igraph Leiden, and NetworKit Leiden by 341x, 83x, and 6.1x respectively - achieving a processing rate of 328M edges/s on a 3.8B edge graph. Furthermore, GSP-Louvain improves performance at a rate of 1.5x for every doubling of threads.</description>

      <title>GSL-LPA: Fast Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) for Community Detection with no Internally-Disconnected Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of identifying tightly connected clusters of nodes within a network. Efficient parallel algorithms for this play a crucial role in various applications, especially as datasets expand to significant sizes. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is commonly employed for this purpose due to its ease of parallelization, rapid execution, and scalability. However, it may yield internally disconnected communities. This technical report introduces GSL-LPA, derived from our parallelization of LPA, namely GVE-LPA. Our experiments on a system with two 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors show that GSL-LPA not only mitigates this issue but also surpasses FLPA, igraph LPA, and NetworKit LPA by 55x, 10,300x, and 5.8x, respectively, achieving a processing rate of 844 M edges/s on a 3.8 B edge graph. Additionally, GSL-LPA scales at a rate of 1.6x for every doubling of threads.</description>

      <title>Non-robustness of diffusion estimates on networks with measurement error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network diffusion models are used to study things like disease transmission, information spread, and technology adoption. However, small amounts of mismeasurement are extremely likely in the networks constructed to operationalize these models. We show that estimates of diffusions are highly non-robust to this measurement error. First, we show that even when measurement error is vanishingly small, such that the share of missed links is close to zero, forecasts about the extent of diffusion will greatly underestimate the truth. Second, a small mismeasurement in the identity of the initial seed generates a large shift in the locations of expected diffusion path. We show that both of these results still hold when the vanishing measurement error is only local in nature. Such non-robustness in forecasting exists even under conditions where the basic reproductive number is consistently estimable. Possible solutions, such as estimating the measurement error or implementing widespread detection efforts, still face difficulties because the number of missed links are so small. Finally, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations on simulated networks, and real networks from three settings: travel data from the COVID-19 pandemic in the western US, a mobile phone marketing campaign in rural India, and in an insurance experiment in China.</description>
