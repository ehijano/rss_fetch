      <title>Learning Quantitative Automata Modulo Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative automata are useful representations for numerous applications, including modeling probability distributions over sequences to Markov chains and reward machines. Actively learning such automata typically occurs using explicitly gathered input-output examples under adaptations of the L-star algorithm. However, obtaining explicit input-output pairs can be expensive, and there exist scenarios, including preference-based learning or learning from rankings, where providing constraints is a less exerting and a more natural way to concisely describe desired properties. Consequently, we propose the problem of learning deterministic quantitative automata from sets of constraints over the valuations of input sequences. We present QUINTIC, an active learning algorithm, wherein the learner infers a valid automaton through deductive reasoning, by applying a theory to a set of currently available constraints and an assumed preference model and quantitative automaton class. QUINTIC performs a complete search over the space of automata, and is guaranteed to be minimal and correctly terminate. Our evaluations utilize theory of rationals in order to learn summation, discounted summation, product, and classification quantitative automata, and indicate QUINTIC is effective at learning these types of automata.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Verification of Systems with Precise (0,1)-Counter Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for verifying systems with a parametric number of concurrently running processes. The systems we consider are well-structured with respect to a specific well-quasi order. This allows us to decide a wide range of verification problems, including control-state reachability, coverability, and target, in a fixed finite abstraction of the infinite state-space, called a 01-counter system. We show that several systems from the parameterized verification literature fall into this class, including reconfigurable broadcast networks (or systems with lossy broadcast), disjunctive systems, synchronizations and systems with a fixed number of shared finite-domain variables. Our framework provides a simple and unified explanation for the properties of these systems, which have so far been investigated separately. Additionally, it extends and improves on a range of the existing results, and gives rise to other systems with similar properties.</description>

      <title>Two-Way One-Counter Nets Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One Counter Nets (OCNs) are finite-state automata equipped with a counter that cannot become negative, but cannot be explicitly tested for zero. Their close connection to various other models (e.g., PDAs, Vector Addition Systems, and Counter Automata) make them an attractive modeling tool. The two-way variant of OCNs (2-OCNs) was introduced in the 1980's and shown to be more expressive than OCNs, so much so that the emptiness problem is undecidable already in the deterministic model (2-DOCNs). In a first part, we study the emptiness problem of natural restrictions of 2-OCNs, under the light of modern results about Vector Addition System with States (VASS). We show that emptiness is decidable for 2-OCNs over \emph{bounded languages} i.e., languages contained in $a_1^*a_2^*\cdots a_k^*$), and decidable and Ackermann-complete for \emph{sweeping} 2-OCNs, where the head direction only changes at the end-markers. Both decidability results revolve around reducing the problem to VASS reachability, but they rely on strikingly different approaches.
  In a second part, we study the expressive power of 2-OCNs, showing an array of connections between bounded languages, sweeping 2-OCNs, and semilinear languages. Most noteworthy among these connections, is that the bounded languages recognized by sweeping 2-OCNs are precisely those that are semilinear. Finally, we establish an intricate pumping lemma for 2-DOCNs and use it to show that there are OCN languages that are not 2-DOCN recognizable, improving on the known result that there are such 2-OCN languages.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Deterministic Weighted Real-time One-Counter Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces deterministic weighted real-time one-counter automaton (DWROCA). A DWROCA is a deterministic real-time one-counter automaton whose transitions are assigned a weight from a field. Two DWROCAs are equivalent if every word accepted by one is accepted by the other with the same weight. DWROCA is a sub-class of weighted one-counter automata with counter-determinacy. It is known that the equivalence problem for this model is in P. This paper gives a simpler proof and a better polynomial-time algorithm for checking the equivalence of two DWROCAs.</description>

      <title>Topoi of automata I: Four topoi of automata and regular languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both topos theory and automata theory are known for their multi-faceted nature and relationship with topology, algebra, logic, and category theory. This paper aims to clarify the topos-theoretic aspects of automata theory, particularly demonstrating through two main theorems how regular (and non-regular) languages arise in topos-theoretic calculation. First, it is shown that the four different notions of automata form four types of Grothendieck topoi, illustrating how the technical details of automata theory are described by topos theory. Second, we observe that the four characterizations of regular languages (DFA, Myhill-Nerode theorem, finite monoids, profinite words) provide Morita-equivalent definitions of a single Boolean-ringed topos, situating this within the context of Olivia Caramello's 'Toposes as Bridges.'
  This paper also serves as a preparation for follow-up papers, which deal with the relationship between hyperconnected geometric morphisms and algebraic/geometric aspects of formal language theory.</description>

      <title>Implicit automata in {\lambda}-calculi III: affine planar string-to-string functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a characterization of first-order string-to-string transduction via $\lambda$-terms typed in non-commutative affine logic that compute with Church encoding, extending the analogous known characterization of star-free languages. We show that every first-order transduction can be computed by a $\lambda$-term using a known Krohn-Rhodes-style decomposition lemma. The converse direction is given by compiling $\lambda$-terms into two-way reversible planar transducers. The soundness of this translation involves showing that the transition functions of those transducers live in a monoidal closed category of diagrams in which we can interpret purely affine $\lambda$-terms. One challenge is that the unit of the tensor of the category in question is not a terminal object. As a result, our interpretation does not identify $\beta$-equivalent terms, but it does turn $\beta$-reductions into inequalities in a poset-enrichment of the category of diagrams.</description>
