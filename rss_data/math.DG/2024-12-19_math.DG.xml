      <title>On stability and scalar curvature rigidity of quaternion-K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every quaternion-K\"ahler manifold of negative scalar curvature is stable as an Einstein manifold and therefore scalar curvature rigid. In particular, this implies that every irreducible nonpositive Einstein manifold of special holonomy is stable. In contrast, we demonstrate that there exist quaternion-K\"ahler manifolds of positive scalar curvature which are not scalar curvature rigid even though they are semi-stable.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$ Gauss dual Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the $L_p$-Gauss dual curvature measure and proposes its related $L_p$-Gauss dual Minkowski problem as: for $p,q\in\mathbb{R}$, under what necessary and/or sufficient condition on a non-zero finite Borel measure $\mu$ on unit sphere does there exist a convex body $K$ such that $\mu$ is the $L_p$ Gauss dual curvature measure? If $K$ exists, to what extent is it unique? This problem amounts to solving a class of Monge-Amp\`{e}re type equations on unit sphere in smooth case:
  \begin{align}\label{0.1}
  e^{-\frac{|\nabla h_K|^2+h_K^2}{2}}h_K^{1-p}
  (|\nabla h_K|^2+h_K^2)^{\frac{q-n}{2}}
  \det(\nabla^2h_K+h_KI)=f,
  \end{align} where $f$ is a given positive smooth function on unit sphere, $h_k$ is the support function of convex body $K$, $\nabla h_K$ and $\nabla^2h_K$ are the gradient and Hessian of $h_K$ on unit sphere with respect to an orthonormal basis, and $I$ is the identity matrix.
  We confirm the existence of solution to the new problem with $p,q&gt;0$ and the existence of smooth solution to the equation (\ref{0.1}) with $p ,q\in\mathbb{R}$ by variational method and Gaussian curvature flow method, respectively. Furthermore, the uniqueness of solution to the equation (\ref{0.1}) in the case $p,q\in\mathbb{R}$ with $q&lt;p$ is established.</description>

      <title>$\eta$-Ricci solitons and $\eta$-Einstein metrics on weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study is motivated by the interest in metric $f$-contact geometry and Ricci-type solitons in theoretical physics and geometry. Weak $f$-structures on a smooth manifold $M^{2n+s}\ (s&gt;1)$ have been introduced by V. Rovenski and R. Wolak as a generalization of $f$-structures by K. Yano. In this paper, we introduce new structures of this kind called weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-structures as a generalization of the concept by K. Kenmotsu (and its extensions by other geometers) and explore their properties and geometrical interpretations. The paper demonstrates that a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-manifold is locally a twisted/warped product of $\mathbb{R}^s$ and a weak K\"{a}hlerian manifold. It also shows that such manifolds with constant $\beta$ and an $\eta$-Ricci soliton structure have constant scalar curvature and can be $\eta$-Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>A family of instanton-invariants for four-manifolds and their relation to Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews Witten's gauge-theoretic approach to Khovanov homology from the perspective of Haydys-Witten instanton Floer theory. Expanding on Witten's arguments, we introduce a one-parameter family of instanton Floer homology groups $HF_{\theta}(W^4)$, which, based on physical arguments, are expected to be topological invariants of the four-manifold $W^4$. In analogy to the original Yang-Mills instanton Floer theory, these groups are defined by the solutions of the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$ modulo instanton solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between them on the five-dimensional cylinder $\mathbb{R}_s \times W^4$. The relation to knot invariants arises when the four-manifold is the geometric blowup $W^4 = [X^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K]$ along a knot $K \subset X^3 \times \{0\}$ embedded in its three-dimensional boundary. The boundaries and corners of this manifold require the specification of boundary conditions that preserve the topological invariance of the construction and are fundamentally linked to various dimensional reductions of the Haydys-Witten equations. We provide a comprehensive discussion of these dimensional reductions and relate them to well-known gauge-theoretic equations in lower dimensions, including the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations, twisted extended Bogomolny equations, and twisted octonionic Nahm equations. Along the way, we record novel results on the elliptic regularity of the Haydys-Witten equations with twisted Nahm pole boundary conditions. The upshot of the article is a tentative definition of Haydys-Witten Floer theory and a precise restatement of Witten's conjecture: an equality between the Haydys-Witten Floer homology $HF^\bullet_{\pi/2}([S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K])$ and Khovanov homology $Kh^\bullet(K)$.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares Programming for Ma-Trudinger-Wang Regularity of Optimal Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given ground cost, approximating the Monge optimal transport map that pushes forward a given probability measure onto another has become a staple in several modern machine learning algorithms. The fourth-order Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) tensor associated with this ground cost function provides a notion of curvature in optimal transport. The non-negativity of this tensor plays a crucial role for establishing continuity for the Monge optimal transport map. It is, however, generally difficult to analytically verify this condition for any given ground cost. To expand the class of cost functions for which MTW non-negativity can be verified, we propose a provably correct computational approach which provides certificates of non-negativity for the MTW tensor using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) programming. We further show that our SOS technique can also be used to compute an inner approximation of the region where MTW non-negativity holds. We apply our proposed SOS programming method to several practical ground cost functions to approximate the regions of regularity of their corresponding optimal transport maps.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of $L^2$-spaces with manifold targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the isometry group of $L^2(\Omega, M)$ for Riemannian manifolds $M$ of dimension at least two with irreducible universal cover. We establish a rigidity result for the isometries of these spaces: any isometry arises from an automorphism of $\Omega$ and a family of isometries of $M$, distinguishing these spaces from the classical $L^2(\Omega)$. Additionally, we prove that these spaces lack irreducible factors and that two such spaces are isometric if and only if the underlying manifolds are.</description>

      <title>Solitons to Mean Curvature Flow in the hyperbolic 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider {translators} (i.e., initial condition of translating solitons) to mean curvature flow (MCF) in the hyperbolic $3$-space $\mathbb H^3$, providing existence and classification results. More specifically, we show the existence and uniqueness of two distinct one-parameter families of complete rotational translators in $\mathbb H^3$, one containing catenoid-type translators, and the other parabolic cylindrical ones. We establish a tangency principle for translators in $\mathbb H^3$ and apply it to prove that properly immersed translators to MCF in $\mathbb H^3$ are not cylindrically bounded. As a further application of the tangency principle, we prove that any horoconvex translator which is complete or transversal to the $x_3$-axis is necessarily an open set of a horizontal horosphere. In addition, we classify all translators in $\mathbb H^3$ which have constant mean curvature. We also consider rotators (i.e., initial condition of rotating solitons) to MCF in $\mathbb H^3$ and, after classifying the rotators of constant mean curvature, we show that there exists a one-parameter family of complete rotators which are all helicoidal, bringing to the hyperbolic context a distinguished result by Halldorsson, set in $\mathbb R^3$.</description>

Abstract: The notion of a generalized product, refining that of a (symmetric and smooth) simplicial space is introduced and shown to imply the existence of an algebra of pseudodifferential operators. This encompasses many constructions of such algebras on manifolds with corners. The main examples discussed in detail here are related to the semiclassical (and adiabatic) calculus as used in the approach to a twisted form of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem in work with Is Singer and Mathai Varghese.</description>

      <title>On the Work of Cartan and M\"{u}nzner on Isoparametric Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hypersurface $M^n$ in a real space form ${\bf R}^{n+1}$, $S^{n+1}$, or $H^{n+1}$ is isoparametric if it has constant principal curvatures. This paper is a survey of the fundamental work of Cartan and M\"{u}nzner on the theory of isoparametric hypersurfaces in real space forms, in particular, spheres. This work is contained in four papers of Cartan published during the period 1938--1940, and two papers of M\"{u}nzner that were published in preprint form in the early 1970's, and as journal articles in 1980--1981. These papers of Cartan and M\"{u}nzner have been the foundation of the extensive field of isoparametric hypersurfaces, and they have all been recently translated into English by T. Cecil. The paper concludes with a brief survey of the recently completed classification of isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres.</description>

      <title>Quantum Observables of Quantized Fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has become widely appreciated that defining (higher) gauge theories requires, in addition to ordinary phase space data, also "flux quantization" laws in generalized differential cohomology, there has been little discussion of the general rules, if any, for lifting Poisson-brackets of (flux-)observables and their quantization from traditional phase spaces to the resulting higher moduli stacks of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  In this short note, we present a systematic analysis of (i) the canonical quantization of flux observables in Yang-Mills theory and (ii) of valid flux quantization laws in abelian Yang-Mills, observing (iii) that the resulting topological quantum observables form the homology Pontrjagin algebra of the loop space of the moduli space of flux-quantized gauge fields.
  This is remarkable because the homology Ponrjagin algebra on loops of moduli makes immediate sense in broad generality for higher and non-abelian (non-linearly coupled) gauge fields, such as for the C-field in 11d supergravity, where it recovers the quantum effects previously discussed in the context of "Hypothesis H".</description>

      <title>The M-algebra completes the hierarchy of Super-Exceptional Tangent Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conjectured symmetries of M-theory famously involve (1.) brane-extended super-symmetry (the M-algebra) and (2.) exceptional duality-symmetry (the $\mathfrak{e}_{11}$-algebra); but little attention has been given to their inevitable combination.
  In this little note, we highlight (by combining results available in the literature) that the $local$ exceptional duality-symmetry (the hyperbolic involutory $\mathfrak{k}_{1,10} \subset \mathfrak{e}_{11}$) acts on the M-algebra, through the "brane-rotating symmetry" $\mathfrak{sl}_{32}$, in a way which extends the known hierarchy of finite-dimensional $n$-exceptional tangent spaces compatibly beyond the traditional bound of $n \leq 7$ all the way to $n = 11$.</description>
