      <title>Geometry of two- and three-dimensional integrable systems related to affine Weyl groups $W(E_8^{(1)})$ and $W(E_7^{(1)})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a general framework for the construction of birational involutions on two- and three-dimensional varieties obtained from $\mathbb P^2$, $\mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1$, and $\mathbb P^3$ by blow-up at nine, respectively eight points. Each such involution is based on a divisor class with a one-dimensional linear system with a generic element of genus zero. Classical Manin involutions represent the simplest particular case. Novel, more sophisticated cases identified here include birational involutions of $\mathbb P^2$ along conics and along nodal cubic curves, as well as birational involutions of $\mathbb P^3$ along quadratic cones and along Cayley nodal cubic surfaces. We prove a general formula for the induced action of geometric birational involutions on the respective Picard group, and give a general result about decomposition of translational elements of the respective affine Weyl group of symmetries into a product of two geometric birational involutions.</description>

      <title>Solving the tetrahedron equation by Teichm\"uller TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to construct three-dimensional lattice models using line defects in state integral models on shaped triangulations of 3-manifolds. The Boltzmann weights for these models satisfy a variant of the tetrahedron equation, which implies integrability under suitable assumptions on R-matrices and transfer matrices. As an explicit example, we present a solution produced by Teichm\"uller TQFT.</description>

      <title>Integrability of certain Hamiltonian systems in $2D$ variable curvature spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to examine the integrability of Hamiltonian systems in $2D$ spaces with variable curvature of certain types. Based on the differential Galois theory, we announce the necessary conditions of the integrability. They are given in terms of arithmetic restrictions on values of the parameters describing the system. We apply the obtained results to some examples to illustrate that the applicability of the obtained result is easy and effective. Certain new integrable examples are given. The findings highlight the applicability of the differential Galois approach in studying the integrability of Hamiltonian systems in curved spaces, expanding our understanding of nonlinear dynamics and its potential applications.</description>

      <title>Small-time asymptotics and the emergence of complex singularities for the KdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While real-valued solutions of the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation have been studied extensively over the past 50 years, much less attention has been devoted to solution behaviour in the complex plane. Here we consider the analytic continuation of real solutions of KdV and investigate the role that complex-plane singularities play in early-time solutions on the real line. We apply techniques of exponential asymptotics to derive the small-time behaviour for dispersive waves that propagate in one direction, and demonstrate how the amplitude, wavelength and speed of these waves depend on the strength and location of double-pole singularities of the initial condition in the complex plane. Using matched asymptotic expansions in the limit $t\rightarrow 0^+$, we show how complex singularities of the time-dependent solution of the KdV equation emerge from these double-pole singularities. Generically, their speed as they move from their initial position is of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-2/3})$, while the direction in which these singularities propagate initially is dictated by a Painlev\'{e} II (P$_{\mathrm{II}}$) problem with decreasing tritronqu\'{e}e solutions. The well-known $N$-soliton solutions of KdV correspond to rational solutions of P$_{\mathrm{II}}$ with a finite number of singularities; otherwise, we postulate that infinitely many complex-plane singularities of KdV solutions are born at each double-pole singularity of the initial condition. We also provide asymptotic results for some non-generic cases in which singularities propagate more slowly than in the generic case. Our study makes progress towards the goal of providing a complete description of KdV solutions in the complex plane and, in turn, of relating this behaviour to the solution on the real line.</description>

      <title>Analytic General Solution of the Riccati equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel integrability condition for the Riccati equation, the simplest form of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, is obtained by using elementary quadrature method. Under this condition, the analytical general solution containing free parameters is presented, which can be extended to second-order linear ordinary differential equation. These results provide valuable mathematical criteria for analyzing nonlinear phenomena in many disciplines.</description>

      <title>The Self-Duality Equations on a Riemann Surface and Four-Dimensional Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian formulation of Hitchin's self-duality equations on a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ using potentials for the connection and Higgs field. This two-dimensional action is then obtained from a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on $\Sigma\times \mathbb{CP}^1$ with an appropriate choice of meromorphic 1-form on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and boundary conditions at its poles. We show that the symplectic structure induced by the four-dimensional theory coincides with the canonical symplectic form on the Hitchin moduli space in the complex structure corresponding to the moduli space of Higgs bundles. We further provide a direct construction of Hitchin Hamiltonians in terms of the four-dimensional gauge field. Exploiting the freedom in the choice of the meromorphic one-form, we construct a family of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theories depending on a $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter. Upon reduction to two dimensions, these descend to a corresponding family of two-dimensional actions on $\Sigma$ whose field equations are again Hitchin's equations. Furthermore, we obtain a family of symplectic structures from our family of four-dimensional theories and show that they agree with the hyperk\"ahler family of symplectic forms on the Hitchin moduli space, thereby identifying the $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter with the twistor parameter of the Hitchin moduli space. Our results place Hitchin's equations and their integrable structure within the framework of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and make the role of the twistor parameter manifest.</description>

      <title>Heun-function analysis of the Dirac spinor spectrum in a sine-Gordon soliton background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirac spectrum in a sine-Gordon soliton background, where the induced position-dependent mass reduces the spectral problem to a Heun-type differential equation. Bound and scattering sectors are treated within a unified framework, with spectral data encoded in Wronskians matching local Heun solutions and exhibiting explicit dependence on the soliton parameters and the bare fermion mass. This formulation enables a systematic analysis of spinor bound and scattering states, supported by analytic and numerical verification of wave function matching across the soliton domain. The present work is related to arXiv:2512.07658 and emphasizes a pedagogical treatment of scattering states within the Heun-equation formalism.</description>
