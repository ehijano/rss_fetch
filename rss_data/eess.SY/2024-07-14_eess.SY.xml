      <title>Joint Load and Capacity Scheduling for Flexible Radio Resource Management of High-Throughput Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work first explores using flexible beam-user mapping to optimize the beam service range and beam position, in order to adapt the non-uniform traffic demand to offer in high-throughput satellite (HTS) systems. Second, on this basis, the joint flexible bandwidth allocation is adopted to adapt the offer to demand at the same time. This strategy allows both beam capacity and load to be adjusted to cope with the traffic demand. The new information generated during the load transfer process of flexible beam-user mapping can guide the direction of beam optimization. Then, the proposed strategies are tested against joint power-bandwidth allocation and joint optimization of bandwidth and beam-user mapping under different traffic profiles. Numerical results are obtained for various non-uniform traffic distributions to evaluate the performance of the solutions. Results show that flexible joint load and capacity scheduling are superior to other strategies in terms of demand satisfaction with acceptable complexity. Our source code along with results are available at crystal-zwz/HTS_RRM_Joint-Load-and-Capacity-Scheduling (github.com).</description>

      <title>Real-time Pipe Burst Localization in Water Distribution Networks Using Change Point Detection Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change point detection (CPD) has proved to be an effective tool for detecting drifts in data and its use over the years has become more pronounced due to the vast amount of data and IoT devices readily available. This study analyzes the effectiveness of Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) and Shewhart Control Charts for identifying the occurrence of abrupt pressure changes for pipe burst localization in Water Distribution Network (WDN). Change point detection algorithms could be useful for identifying the nodes that register the earliest and most drastic pressure changes with the aim of detecting pipe bursts in real-time. TSNet, a Python package, is employed in order to simulate pipe bursts in a WDN. The pressure readings are served to the pipe burst localization algorithm the moment they are available for real-time pie burst localization. The performance of the pipe burst localization algorithm is evaluated using a key metric such as localization accuracy under different settings to compare its performance when paired with either CUSUM or Shewhart. Results show that the pipe burst localization algorithm has an overall better performance when paired with CUSUM. Although, it does show great accuracy for both CPD algorithms when pressure readings are being continuously made available without a big gap between time steps. The proposed approach however still needs further experiments on different WDNs to assess the performance and accuracy of the algorithm on real-world WDN models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling and Stability Analysis of Balancing in Riderless Electric Scooters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, electric scooter is a trendy personal mobility vehicle. The rising demand and opportunities attract ride-share services. A common problem of such services is abandoned e-scooters. An autonomous e-scooter capable of moving to the charging station is a solution. This paper focuses on maintaining balance for these riderless e-scooters. The paper presents a nonlinear model for an e-scooter moving with simultaneously varying speed and steering. A PD and a feedback-linearized PD controller stabilize the model. The stability analysis shows that the controllers are ultimately bounded even with parameter uncertainties and measurement inaccuracy. Simulations on a realistic e-scooter with a general demanding path to follow verify the ultimate boundedness of the controllers. In addition, the feedback-linearized PD controller outperforms the PD controller because it has narrower ultimate bounds. Future work focuses on experiments using a self-balancing mechanism installed on an e-scooter.</description>

      <title>Perceived Time To Collision as Public Space Users' Discomfort Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-mobility transport vehicles such as e-scooters are joining current sidewalk users and affect the safety and comfort of pedestrians as primary sidewalk users. The lack of agreed-upon metrics to quantify people's discomfort hinders shared public space safety research. We introduce perceived Time To Collision (TTC) as a potential metric of user discomfort performing controlled experiments using an e-scooter and a pedestrian moving in a hallway. The results strongly correlate the participant's reported discomfort and the perceived TTC. Therefore, TTC is a potential metric for public space users' discomfort. Since the metric only uses relative velocity and position information, it is a viable candidate for neighboring people's discomfort estimation in advanced driver assistance systems for e-scooters and PMVs. Our ongoing research extends the results to mobile robots.</description>

      <title>Codification of Good Seamanship in Complex and Congested Waterways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to quantify seafarers' good seamanship during navigation scenarios with multi-vessel encounters -- in open and confined waters --, and to compute COLREG's-compliant trajectories for avoiding collision and grounding. The quantification of good seamanship requires knowledge about the state of the vessels (position, heading, and speed) and the surrounding sailing environment. Such information is accessible through the AIS system and the electronic nautical chart. The proposed method evaluates mutual collision risk by examining domain violations of each vessel, and comparing them to the seaman's actions. This results in a comprehensive metric of good seamanship. As risk free actions are not always possible in the resolution of a potential collision and grounding, the method adopts a branch-and-bound scheme to identify achievable maneuvers that minimize the risk. Further, the dynamic nature of vessel speed in congested scenarios is considered, recognizing potential changes in both own and target vessels' forward speeds. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated using historical AIS data and sea charts of Danish waters. This research contributes to the field by providing a more realistic perspective on seamanship in complex maritime environments.</description>

      <title>A software framework for stochastic model predictive control of nonlinear continuous-time systems (GRAMPC-S)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the open-source stochastic model predictive control framework GRAMPC-S for nonlinear uncertain systems with chance constraints. It provides several uncertainty propagation methods to predict stochastic moments of the system state and can consider unknown parts of the system dynamics using Gaussian process regression. These methods are used to reformulate a stochastic MPC formulation as a deterministic one that is solved with GRAMPC. The performance of the presented framework is evaluated using examples from a wide range of technical areas. The experimental evaluation shows that GRAMPC-S can be used in practice for the control of nonlinear uncertain systems with sampling times in the millisecond range.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Selection in Replicator Equations Using Adaptive-Gain Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the equilibrium selection problem, which amounts to steering a population of individuals engaged in strategic game-theoretic interactions to a desired collective behavior. In the literature, this problem has been typically tackled by means of open-loop strategies, whose applicability is however limited by the need of accurate a priori information on the game and scarce robustness to uncertainty and noise. Here, we overcome these limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain control scheme within a replicator equation -a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the population. For most classes of 2-action matrix games we establish sufficient conditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator equation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a-priori information on the game. Numerical simulations corroborate and expand our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Cost-optimized probabilistic maintenance for condition monitoring of wind turbines with rare failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method, a model, and a form of presenting model results for condition monitoring of a small set of wind turbines with rare failures. The main new ingredient of the method is to sample failure thresholds according to the profit they give to an operating company. The model is a multiple linear regression with seasonal components and external regressors, representing all sensor components except for the considered one. To overcome the scarcity of the training data, we use the median sensor values from all available turbines in their healthy state. The cumulated deviation from the normal behavior model obtained for this median turbine is calibrated for each turbine at the beginning of the test period and after known failures. The proposed form of presenting results is to set a scale for possible costs, control for random maintenance, and show a whole distribution of costs depending on the free model parameters. We make a case study on an open dataset with SCADA data from multiple sensors and show that considering the influence of turbine components is more critical than seasonality. The distribution, the average, and the standard deviation of maintenance costs can be very different for similar minimal costs. Random maintenance can be more profitable than reactive maintenance and other approaches. Our predictive maintenance model outperforms random maintenance and competitors for the whole set of considered turbines, giving substantial savings.</description>

      <title>The Transmission Value of Energy Storage and Fundamental Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the transmission value of energy storage in electric grids. The inherent connection between storage and transmission infrastructure is captured from a "cumulative energy" perspective, which enables the reformulating of the conventional optimization problem by employing line power flow as the decision variable. The study also establishes the theoretical limitations of both storage and transmission lines that can be replaced by each other, providing explicit closed-form expressions for the minimum capacity needed. As a key departure from conventional practice in which transmission lines are designed according to the peak power delivery needs, with sufficient storage capacity, the transmission line capacity can be designed based on the average power delivery needs. The models of this paper only rely on a few basic assumptions, paving the way for understanding future storage as a transmission asset market design. Numerical experiments based on 2-bus, modified RTS 24-bus, RTS-GMLC, and Texas synthetic power systems illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>PID Accelerated Temporal Difference Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon tasks, which have a large discount factor, pose a challenge for most conventional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Algorithms such as Value Iteration and Temporal Difference (TD) learning have a slow convergence rate and become inefficient in these tasks. When the transition distributions are given, PID VI was recently introduced to accelerate the convergence of Value Iteration using ideas from control theory. Inspired by this, we introduce PID TD Learning and PID Q-Learning algorithms for the RL setting in which only samples from the environment are available. We give theoretical analysis of their convergence and acceleration compared to their traditional counterparts. We also introduce a method for adapting PID gains in the presence of noise and empirically verify its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Physics-informed Learning for Stochastic Safety-critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimate of long-term risk is critical for safe decision-making, but sampling from rare risk events and long-term trajectories can be prohibitively costly. Risk gradient can be used in many first-order techniques for learning and control methods, but gradient estimate is difficult to obtain using Monte Carlo (MC) methods because the infinitesimal devisor may significantly amplify sampling noise. Motivated by this gap, we propose an efficient method to evaluate long-term risk probabilities and their gradients using short-term samples without sufficient risk events. We first derive that four types of long-term risk probability are solutions of certain partial differential equations (PDEs). Then, we propose a physics-informed learning technique that integrates data and physics information (aforementioned PDEs). The physics information helps propagate information beyond available data and obtain provable generalization beyond available data, which in turn enables long-term risk to be estimated using short-term samples of safe events. Finally, we demonstrate in simulation that the proposed technique has improved sample efficiency, generalizes well to unseen regions, and adapts to changing system parameters.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Learning Based Framework for Power System Security Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel machine learning-based framework using Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Learning (SS-MTL) for power system dynamic security assessment that is accurate, reliable, and aware of topological changes. The learning algorithm underlying the proposed framework integrates conditional masked encoders and employs multi-task learning for classification-aware feature representation, which improves the accuracy and scalability to larger systems. Additionally, this framework incorporates a confidence measure for its predictions, enhancing its reliability and interpretability. A topological similarity index has also been incorporated to add topological awareness to the framework. Various experiments on the IEEE 68-bus system were conducted to validate the proposed method, employing two distinct database generation techniques to generate the required data to train the machine learning algorithm. The results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art machine learning based techniques for security assessment in terms of accuracy and robustness. Finally, our work underscores the value of employing auto-encoders for security assessment, highlighting improvements in accuracy, reliability, and robustness. All datasets and codes used have been made publicly available to ensure reproducibility and transparency.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fidelity-Aware Entanglement Distribution in Linear Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of entanglement distribution in terms of maximizing a utility function that captures the total fidelity of end-to-end entanglements in a two-link linear quantum network with a source, a repeater, and a destination. The nodes have several quantum memories, and the problem is how to coordinate entanglement purification in each of the links, and entanglement swapping across links, so as to achieve the goal above. We show that entanglement swapping (i.e, deciding on the pair of qubits from each link to perform swapping on) is equivalent to finding a max-weight matching on a bipartite graph. Further, entanglement purification (i.e, deciding which pairs of qubits in a link will undergo purification) is equivalent to finding a max-weight matching on a non-bipartite graph. We propose two polynomial algorithms, the Purify-then-Swap (PtS) and the Swap-then-Purify (StP) ones, where the decisions about purification and swapping are taken with different order. Numerical results show that PtS performs better than StP, and also that the omission of purification in StP gives substantial benefits.</description>

Abstract: In an era where sustainability is becoming increasingly crucial, we introduce a new Carbon-Aware Ant Colony System (CAACS) Algorithm that addresses the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) while minimizing carbon emissions. This novel approach leverages the natural efficiency of ant colony pheromone trails to find optimal routes, balancing both environmental and economic objectives. By integrating sustainability into transportation models, CAACS provides a powerful tool for real-world applications, including network design, delivery route planning, and commercial aircraft logistics. Our algorithm's unique bi-objective optimization advances the study of sustainable transportation solutions.</description>

      <title>A Perspective on Foundation Models for the Electric Power Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) currently dominate news headlines. They employ advanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information autonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich representations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many downstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids, challenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely GridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks benefit.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of Frequency Nadir constraint in the Unit Commitment Problem of Small Power Systems Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the intention is to reduce the amount of thermal generation and to increase the share of clean energy, power systems are increasingly becoming susceptible to frequency instability after outages due to reduced levels of inertia. To address this issue frequency constraints are being included in the scheduling process, which ensure a tolerable frequency deviation in case of any contingencies. In this paper, a method is proposed to integrate the non-linear frequency nadir constraint into the unit commitment problem, using machine learning. First a synthetic training dataset is generated. Then two of the available classic machine learning methods, namely logistic regression and support vector machine, are proposed to predict the frequency nadir. To be able to compare the machine learning methods to traditional frequency constrained unit commitment approaches, simulations on the power system of La Palma island are carried out for both proposed methods as well as an analytical linearized formulation of the frequency nadir. Our results show that the unit commitment problem with a machine learning based frequency nadir constraint is solved considerably faster than with the analytical formulation, while still achieving an acceptable frequency response quality after outages.</description>

      <title>State space representations of the Roesser type for convolutional layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the perspective of control theory, convolutional layers (of neural networks) are 2-D (or N-D) linear time-invariant dynamical systems. The usual representation of convolutional layers by the convolution kernel corresponds to the representation of a dynamical system by its impulse response. However, many analysis tools from control theory, e.g., involving linear matrix inequalities, require a state space representation. For this reason, we explicitly provide a state space representation of the Roesser type for 2-D convolutional layers with $c_\mathrm{in}r_1 + c_\mathrm{out}r_2$ states, where $c_\mathrm{in}$/$c_\mathrm{out}$ is the number of input/output channels of the layer and $r_1$/$r_2$ characterizes the width/length of the convolution kernel. This representation is shown to be minimal for $c_\mathrm{in} = c_\mathrm{out}$. We further construct state space representations for dilated, strided, and N-D convolutions.</description>

      <title>Fast Geometric Learning of MIMO Signal Detection over Grassmannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain or statistical distribution shifts are a key staple of the wireless communication channel, because of the dynamics of the environment. Deep learning (DL) models for detecting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signals in dynamic communication require large training samples (in the order of hundreds of thousands to millions) and online retraining to adapt to domain shift. Some dynamic networks, such as vehicular networks, cannot tolerate the waiting time associated with gathering a large number of training samples or online fine-tuning which incurs significant end-to-end delay. In this paper, a novel classification technique based on the concept of geodesic flow kernel (GFK) is proposed for MIMO signal detection. In particular, received MIMO signals are first represented as points on Grassmannian manifolds by formulating basis of subspaces spanned by the rows vectors of the received signal. Then, the domain shift is modeled using a geodesic flow kernel integrating the subspaces that lie on the geodesic to characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties of the received signals. The kernel derives low-dimensional representations of the received signals over the Grassman manifolds that are invariant to domain shift and is used in a geometric support vector machine (G-SVM) algorithm for MIMO signal detection in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method achieves promising performance against the existing baselines like OAMPnet and MMNet with only 1,200 training samples and without online retraining.</description>

      <title>A Two-stage Identification Method for Switched Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a new two-stage identification method based on dynamic programming and sparsity inducing is proposed for switched linear systems. Our method achieves sparsity inducing in the identification of switched linear systems by the constrained switching mechanism, in contrast to previous optimization-based identification techniques that rely on the rigid data distribution assumption in the parameter space. The proposed mechanism assumes the existence of a minimal interval between adjacent switching instants. First, an efficient iterative dynamic programming approach is used to determine the switching instants and segments using the constrained switching mechanism. Then, each submodel is identified as a combinatorial $\ell_0$ optimization problem, and the true parameter for each submodel is determined by solving the problem. The problem of combinatorial $\ell_0$ optimization is solved by relaxing it into a convex $\ell_1$-norm optimization problem. Furthermore, the unbiasedness of the switched linear system identification is discussed thoroughly with the constrained switching mechanism and a new persistent excitation condition is proposed. Simulation experiments are conducted to indicate that our algorithms exhibit strong robustness against noise.</description>

      <title>Globally convergent homotopies for discrete-time optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homotopy methods are attractive due to their capability of solving difficult optimisation and optimal control problems. The underlying idea is to construct a homotopy, which may be considered as a continuous (zero) curve between the difficult original problem and a related, comparatively easy one. Then, the solution of the easier one is continuously perturbed along the zero curve towards the sought-after solution of the original problem. We propose a methodology for the systematic construction of such zero curves for discrete-time optimal control problems drawing upon the theory of globally convergent homotopies for nonlinear programs. The proposed framework ensures that for almost every initial guess at a solution there exists a suitable homotopy path that is, in addition, numerically convenient to track. We demonstrate the results by solving difficult optimal path planning problems for a linear system and the nonlinear nonholonomic car (Dubins' vehicle).</description>

      <title>DISQ: Dynamic Iteration Skipping for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes DISQ to craft a stable landscape for VQA training and tackle the noise drift challenge. DISQ adopts a "drift detector" with a reference circuit to identify and skip iterations that are severely affected by noise drift errors. Specifically, the circuits from the previous training iteration are re-executed as a reference circuit in the current iteration to estimate noise drift impacts. The iteration is deemed compromised by noise drift errors and thus skipped if noise drift flips the direction of the ideal optimization gradient. To enhance noise drift detection reliability, we further propose to leverage multiple reference circuits from previous iterations to provide a well founded judge of current noise drift. Nevertheless, multiple reference circuits also introduce considerable execution overhead. To mitigate extra overhead, we propose Pauli-term subsetting (prime and minor subsets) to execute only observable circuits with large coefficient magnitudes (prime subset) during drift detection. Only this minor subset is executed when the current iteration is drift-free. Evaluations across various applications and QPUs demonstrate that DISQ can mitigate a significant portion of the noise drift impact on VQAs and achieve 1.51-2.24x fidelity improvement over the traditional baseline. DISQ's benefit is 1.1-1.9x over the best alternative approach while boosting average noise detection speed by 2.07x</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Safety Concerns in Automated Driving Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the field of deep learning and impressive performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) for perception have resulted in an increased demand for their use in automated driving (AD) systems. The safety of such systems is of utmost importance and thus requires to consider the unique properties of DNNs.
  In order to achieve safety of AD systems with DNN-based perception components in a systematic and comprehensive approach, so-called safety concerns have been introduced as a suitable structuring element. On the one hand, the concept of safety concerns is -- by design -- well aligned to existing standards relevant for safety of AD systems such as ISO 21448 (SOTIF). On the other hand, it has already inspired several academic publications and upcoming standards on AI safety such as ISO PAS 8800.
  While the concept of safety concerns has been previously introduced, this paper extends and refines it, leveraging feedback from various domain and safety experts in the field. In particular, this paper introduces an additional categorization for a better understanding as well as enabling cross-functional teams to jointly address the concerns.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Infinite-horizon Control: from a pool of samples to the design of dependable controllers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study control of constrained linear systems with only partial statistical information about the uncertainty affecting the system dynamics and the sensor measurements. Specifically, given a finite collection of disturbance realizations drawn from a generic distribution, we consider the problem of designing a stabilizing control policy with provable safety and performance guarantees despite the mismatch between the empirical and true distributions. We capture this discrepancy using Wasserstein ambiguity sets, and we formulate a distributionally robust (DR) optimal control problem, which provides guarantees on the expected cost, safety, and stability of the system. To solve this problem, we first present new results for DR optimization of quadratic objectives using convex programming, showing that strong duality holds under mild conditions. Then, by combining our results with the system-level parametrization of linear feedback policies, we show that the design problem can be reduced to a semidefinite program. We present numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of our approach and to highlight the value of empirical distributions for control design.</description>

      <title>TOP-Nav: Legged Navigation Integrating Terrain, Obstacle and Proprioception Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legged navigation is typically examined within open-world, off-road, and challenging environments. In these scenarios, estimating external disturbances requires a complex synthesis of multi-modal information. This underlines a major limitation in existing works that primarily focus on avoiding obstacles. In this work, we propose TOP-Nav, a novel legged navigation framework that integrates a comprehensive path planner with Terrain awareness, Obstacle avoidance and close-loop Proprioception. TOP-Nav underscores the synergies between vision and proprioception in both path and motion planning. Within the path planner, we present and integrate a terrain estimator that enables the robot to select waypoints on terrains with higher traversability while effectively avoiding obstacles. In the motion planning level, we not only implement a locomotion controller to track the navigation commands, but also construct a proprioception advisor to provide motion evaluations for the path planner. Based on the close-loop motion feedback, we make online corrections for the vision-based terrain and obstacle estimations. Consequently, TOP-Nav achieves open-world navigation that the robot can handle terrains or disturbances beyond the distribution of prior knowledge and overcomes constraints imposed by visual conditions. Building upon extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments, TOP-Nav demonstrates superior performance in open-world navigation compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Bounded Rationality in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nash equilibrium is a common solution concept that captures strategic interaction in electricity market analysis. However, it requires a fundamental but impractical assumption that all market participants are fully rational, implying unlimited computational resources and cognitive abilities. To tackle the limitation, level-k reasoning is proposed and studied to model the bounded rational behaviors. In this paper, we consider a Cournot competition in electricity markets with two suppliers, both following level-k reasoning. One is a self-interested firm and the other serves as a benevolent social planner. First, we observe that the optimal strategy of the social planner corresponds to a particular rationality level, where being either less or more rational may both result in reduced social welfare. We then investigate the effect of bounded rationality on social welfare performance and find that it can largely deviate from that at the Nash equilibrium point. From the perspective of the social planner, we characterize optimal, expectation maximizing and robust maximin strategies, when having access to different information. Finally, by designing its utility function, we find that social welfare is better off if the social planner cooperates with or fights the self-interested firm. Numerical experiments further demonstrate and validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Traffic signal optimization in large-scale urban road networks: an adaptive-predictive controller using Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing smooth traffic flow is important for achieving carbon neutrality. Adaptive traffic signal control, which considers traffic conditions, has thus attracted attention. However, it is difficult to ensure optimal vehicle flow throughout a large city using existing control methods because of their heavy computational load. Here, we propose a control method called AMPIC (Adaptive Model Predictive Ising Controller) that guarantees both scalability and optimality. The proposed method employs model predictive control to solve an optimal control problem at each control interval with explicit consideration of a predictive model of vehicle flow. This optimal control problem is transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables that is equivalent to the so-called Ising problem. This transformation allows us to use an Ising solver, which has been widely studied and is expected to have fast and efficient optimization performance. We performed numerical experiments using a microscopic traffic simulator for a realistic city road network. The results show that AMPIC enables faster vehicle cruising speed with less waiting time than that achieved by classical control methods, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. The model predictive approach with a long prediction horizon thus effectively improves control performance. Systematic parametric studies on model cities indicate that the proposed method realizes smoother traffic flows for large city road networks. Among Ising solvers, D-Wave's quantum annealing is shown to find near-optimal solutions at a reasonable computational cost.</description>
