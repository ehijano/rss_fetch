      <title>Hedging via Perpetual Derivatives: Trinomial Option Pricing and Implied Parameter Surface Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fairly general, recombining trinomial tree model in the natural world. Market-completeness is ensured by considering a market consisting of two risky assets, a riskless asset, and a European option.The two risky assets consist of a stock and a perpetual derivative of that stock.The option has the stock and its derivative as its underlying. Using a replicating portfolio, we develop prices for European options and generate the unique relationships between the risk-neutral and real-world parameters of the model. We discuss calibration of the model to empirical data in the cases in which the risky asset returns are treated as either arithmetic or logarithmic. From historical price and call option data for select large cap stocks, we develop implied parameter surfaces for the real-world parameters in the model.</description>

      <title>Callable convertible bonds under liquidity constraints and hybrid priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the callable convertible bond problem in the presence of a liquidity constraint modelled by Poisson signals. We assume that neither the bondholder nor the firm has absolute priority when they stop the game simultaneously, but instead, a proportion $m\in[0,1]$ of the bond is converted to the firm's stock and the rest is called by the firm. The paper thus generalizes the special case studied in [Liang and Sun, Dynkin games with Poisson random intervention times, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 57 (2019), 2962-2991] where the bondholder has priority ($m=1$), and presents a complete solution to the callable convertible bond problem with liquidity constraint. The callable convertible bond is an example of a Dynkin game, but falls outside the standard paradigm since the payoffs do not depend in an ordered way upon which agent stops the game. We show how to deal with this non-ordered situation by introducing a new technique which may be of interest in its own right, and then apply it to the bond problem.</description>

      <title>Formation of Optimal Interbank Networks under Liquidity Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of an optimal interbank network in a model where banks control both their supply of liquidity, through cash reserves, and their exposures to other banks' risky projects. The value of each bank's project may suddenly decline depending on their cash reserves and both the occurence and magnitude of liquidity shocks. In two distinct settings, we solve the system-wide optimal control problem and obtain explicit formulas for the unique optimal allocations of capital. In the first decentralized setting, banks seek only to maximize their own expected utility. Second, a central planner aims to maximize the sum of all banks' expected utilities. Both of the resulting networks exhibit a `core-periphery' structure in equilibrium. However, in the decentralized setting, banks elect to hold less cash reserves compared to the centralized setting, leading to greater susceptibility to liquidity shortages. We characterize the behavior of the planner's optimal allocation as the size of the system grows. Surprisingly, the relative welfare gap is of constant order. Finally, we derive co-investment requirements that allow the decentralized system to achieve the planner's optimal level of risk. In doing so, we find that banks in the network's core are subjected to the highest co-investment requirements -- ensuring that they are sufficiently incentivized to hold significant cash reserves. Our analysis may inform regulators' requirements on banks' liquidity reserves, as have been debated in the wake of the 2023 regional banking crisis in the US.</description>

      <title>Signature Methods in Stochastic Portfolio Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of stochastic portfolio theory we introduce a novel class of portfolios which we call linear path-functional portfolios. These are portfolios which are determined by certain transformations of linear functions of a collections of feature maps that are non-anticipative path functionals of an underlying semimartingale. As main example for such feature maps we consider the signature of the (ranked) market weights. We prove that these portfolios are universal in the sense that every continuous, possibly path-dependent, portfolio function of the market weights can be uniformly approximated by signature portfolios. We also show that signature portfolios can approximate the growth-optimal portfolio in several classes of non-Markovian market models arbitrarily well and illustrate numerically that the trained signature portfolios are remarkably close to the theoretical growth-optimal portfolios. Besides these universality features, the main numerical advantage lies in the fact that several optimization tasks like maximizing (expected) logarithmic wealth or mean-variance optimization within the class of linear path-functional portfolios reduce to a convex quadratic optimization problem, thus making it computationally highly tractable. We apply our method also to real market data based on several indices. Our results point towards out-performance on the considered out-of-sample data, also in the presence of transaction costs.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of options written on SOFR futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical approach to pricing options on SOFR futures where the underlying SOFR follows a time-dependent CEV model. By definition, these options change their type at the beginning of the reference period: before this time, this is an American option written on a SOFR forward price as an underlying, and after this point, this is an arithmetic Asian option with an American style exercise written on the daily SOFR rates. We develop a new version of the GIT method and solve both problems semi-analytically, obtaining the option price, the exercise boundary, and the option Greeks. This work is intended to address the concern that the transfer from LIBOR to SOFR has resulted in a situation in which the options of the key money market (i.e., futures on the reference rate) are options without any pricing model available. Therefore, the trading in options on 3M SOFR futures currently ends before their reference quarter starts, to eliminate the final metamorphosis into exotic options.</description>
