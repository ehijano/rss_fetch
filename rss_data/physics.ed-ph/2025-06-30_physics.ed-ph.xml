      <title>Quantum Workshop for IT-Professionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is gaining strategic relevance beyond research-driven industries. However, many companies lack the expertise to evaluate its potential for real-world applications. Traditional training formats often focus on physical principles without demonstrating practical relevance, which limits success. This paper presents a user-centered workshop concept tailored to IT professionals without prior quantum knowledge. Using a business game set in a fictitious company, participants explore quantum technologies through relatable, application-driven scenarios. The flexible design allows customization for different organizational contexts. Evaluation results from a one-day implementation at the IT-Tage 2024 indicate clear learning progress and increased awareness of practical use cases. The approach effectively bridges the gap between complex quantum concepts and industry-specific application needs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Outreach on Physics Student Development: Qualitative Results from a National Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of student experiences in physics beyond the classroom which support their development has been the subject of exciting research in recent years. Results, typically from small studies at single institutions, have illustrated that facilitating informal physics experiences for non-scientists can enhance student disciplinary identity, learning, sense of belonging, and more. However, it is essential to examine whether these impacts are the sole provenance of institutions with well-developed outreach programs or if they may be shared by institutions anywhere. This work reports on the analysis and findings of responses to three open-ended questions presented to students who indicated they had engaged in facilitating outreach programs as part of a national survey distributed through the Society of Physics Students network in spring 2023. Employing a network analysis with Girvan-Newman clusters revealed six core themes of student experiences: community participation, resilience, transformation, audience dialog, disciplinary development, and disciplinary connectedness. The first four of these clusters were observed to be highly interconnected, providing evidence that the impacts and experiences within them are interrelated with other clusters, particularly interactions with the audience, which is a central feature of informal physics programs. In particular, student experiences highlighted that facilitating informal physics programs enhanced their resilience and belonging, grew their physics identity, provided opportunities to develop essential career skills, and cultivated a growth mindset.</description>

      <title>Phone physics and the Gateway Arch: Fun with friends and physics at the AAPT Winter Meeting in St. Louis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a famous landmark and feat of engineering, the Gateway Arch was a popular destination at the 2025 AAPT Winter Meeting in St. Louis. The visit to the observation deck of the Gateway Arch is unique, climbing the steps after exiting the small tram capsules and seeing a floor that continues to slope upward assures that you are in fact at the very top. Everyone in our group excitedly took pictures, pointing out local features like the Dred Scott Courthouse. There were many selfies at the pinnacle, and we discussed how to work them into future questions for our students. During our tram ride to the top observation deck of the arch, we lamented that we should have brought pendula to measure the acceleration due to gravity. You can take physics teachers out of the physics conference, but you apparently can't get us to stop talking about physics teaching. Recognizing that we had accelerometers on our phones we collected data on the descent. The authors wanted to collect more complete measurements and returned two days later to repeat the journey, the results of which we present here. For readers wishing to repeat with their students, or who want to apply more advanced data analysis techniques, the authors have made the raw data, our spreadsheets, and a teacher's guide available.</description>
