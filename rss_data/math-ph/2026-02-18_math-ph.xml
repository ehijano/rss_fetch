      <title>Quantization as a Categorical Equivalence for Hilbert Bimodules and Lagrangian Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that classical and quantum theories carry distinct types of representations, each type of representation corresponding to possible values of generalized charges in the classical or quantum context. This paper demonstrates a sense in the structure of these representation theories is preserved from classical to quantum physics. To show this, I discuss distinct representation-theory preserving morphisms in the classical and quantum contexts. Specifically, I consider categories whose morphisms are Lagrangian relations in the classical context and Hilbert bimodules in the quantum context. These morphisms are significant because they give rise to induced representations of classical and quantum theories, respectively. I consider quantization and the classical limit as determining functors between these categories. I treat quantization via the strict deformation quantization of a Poisson algebra and the classical limit via the extension of a uniformly continuous bundle of C*-algebras. With these tools, I prove that the quantization and classical limit functors are "almost-inverse" to each other, thus establishing a categorical equivalence.</description>

      <title>Universality of the Hall conductivity for a weakly interacting magnetic fermionic gas in the Hartree-Fock approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional gas of interacting fermions in presence of an external constant magnetic field: the system is extended and homogeneous, and thus assumed to be invariant under magnetic translations. Working within the Hartree-Fock approximation, we analyze the system directly in the thermodynamic limit by solving a self-consistent fixed-point equation for the one-particle density matrix. We prove that, provided that the interactions among fermions are sufficiently weak, there exists a unique one-particle density matrix that solves the self-consistency condition. By choosing the Fermi-Dirac distribution as the function in the fixed-point equation, this approach can describe both positive and zero-temperature cases.
  At zero temperature and when the chemical potential of the non-interacting system lies in a spectral gap of the free Landau operator, our self-consistent solution is an orthogonal projection (an "interacting" effective Fermi projection). We prove that its integrated density of states varies linearly with the external magnetic field, provided the interaction is weak enough: the slope of this variation is quantized and independent of the interaction. According to the St\v{r}eda formula, this can be seen as yet another expression of the universality of the quantum Hall effect in weakly interacting systems, at least within the Hartree-Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb modules and local operators for critical ADE models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate critical restricted solid-on-solid models associated to Dynkin diagrams of type $A$, $D$ and $E$, with fixed, periodic and twisted periodic boundary conditions. These models are endowed with an action of the diagrams of the Temperley-Lieb category. For each model, we obtain the decomposition of the state space as a direct sum of irreducible modules over the Temperley-Lieb algebra $\mathsf{TL}_N(\beta)$ or its periodic incarnation $\mathsf{\mathcal EPTL}_N(\beta)$. This allows us to recover the known conformal partition functions for these models in the continuum scaling limit.
  For each irreducible factor arising in the decompositions, we define an associated local operator on the lattice, which behaves like a connectivity operator. Using knowledge from the Temperley-Lieb representation theory at roots of unity, we show that these operators satisfy certain linear difference relations, which are lattice counterparts of the singular-vector relations in conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantitative local recovery of Kerr-de Sitter parameters from high-frequency equatorial quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an inverse resonance problem for the scalar wave equation on the Kerr-de Sitter family. In a compact subextremal slow-rotation regime and at a fixed overtone index, high-frequency quasinormal modes admit semiclassical quantization and a real-analytic labeling by angular momentum indices. Using this structure, we first prove that a finite equatorial high-frequency package of quasinormal-mode frequencies determines the mass and rotation parameter $(M,a)$ (for fixed cosmological constant $\Lambda&gt;0$), with a quantitative stability estimate. As a key geometric input we compute explicit second-order (in $a$) corrections to the equatorial photon-orbit invariants which control the leading real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes. Finally, allowing $\Lambda$ to vary in a compact interval, we show that adding one damping observable (the scaled imaginary part of a single equatorial mode) yields a three-parameter inverse theorem: a finite package of three independent real observables determines $(M,a,\Lambda)$ locally in the slow-rotation regime away from $a=0$.</description>

      <title>Deformed Heisenberg algebra and its Hilbert space representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deformation of Heisenberg algebra induces among other consequences a loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Therefore, these operators are not Hermitian, nor is the Hamiltonian operator built from them. In the present paper, we propose a position deformation of Heisenberg algebra with both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties. By using a pseudo-similarity transformation to the non-Hermitian operators, we prove their Hermiticity with a suitable positive-definite pseudo-metric operator. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these pseudo-Hermitian operators. Finally, we study the eigenvalue problem of a free particle in this deformed space and we show that this deformation curved the quantum levels allowing particles to jump from one state to another with low energy transitions.</description>

      <title>Fundamental questions on robustness and accuracy for classical and quantum learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter introduces and investigates some fundamental questions on the relationship between accuracy and robustness in both classical and quantum classification algorithms under noisy and adversarial conditions. We introduce and clarify various definitions of robustness and accuracy, including corrupted-instance robustness accuracy and prediction-change robustness, distinguishing them from conventional accuracy and robustness measures. Through theoretical analysis and toy models, we establish conditions under which trade-offs between accuracy and robustness accuracy arise and identify scenarios where such trade-offs can be avoided. The framework developed highlights the nuanced interplay between model bias, noise characteristics, and perturbation types, including relevant and irrelevant perturbations. We explore the implications of some of these results for incompatible noise, adversarial quantum perturbations, the no free lunch theorem, and suggest future methods to examine these problems from the lens of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Hidden Twisted Sectors and Exponential Degeneracy in Root-of-Unity XXZ Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, product states have been identified as simple-structured eigenstates of XXZ Heisenberg spin models in arbitrary dimensions, occurring at anisotropy values corresponding to certain roots of unity. Yet, the product states typically only span parts of a larger degenerate eigenspace. Here, we classify this eigenspace in the one-dimensional periodic XXZ chain at all roots of unity $q$, where $q^2$ is an $\ell$-th primitive root of unity. For commensurate chain lengths $N$ with $q^N=1$, we prove that the minimal degeneracy is $2^{N/\ell}\ell$ using the representation theory of the affine Temperley-Lieb (aTL) algebra. For the incommensurate case, we derive analogous exponential lower bounds of $2^{2\lfloor\frac{N}{2\ell}\rfloor+1}$ if $N$ is even and $2^{2\lfloor \frac{N}{2\ell}+\frac{1}{2}\rfloor}$ if $N$ is odd and $q^\ell=1$. Our proof employs the morphisms between aTL modules discovered by Pinet and Saint-Aubin and emphasizes the importance of exact sequences and hidden twisted boundary condition sectors that mediate the degeneracy. In the case of commensurate chain lengths, we connect to the Fabricius-McCoy string construction of all Bethe roots of the degenerate subspace, which previously uncovered parts of our results. We corroborate our results numerically and demonstrate that the lower bound is saturated for chain lengths $N\leq20$. Our work demonstrates for a concrete system how the interplay of the Bethe ansatz, aTL representation theory, and twisted boundary conditions explains degeneracy connected to long-lived product states, stimulating research towards generalization to higher dimensions. Exponential degeneracy could boost applications of spin chains as quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to Matrix Models and String Theories: The Local Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact nonperturbative solutions to hermitian one-matrix models, their topological string duals, as well as their double-scaling limits to multicritical and minimal string theories, may be obtained via the use of resurgent transseries. These solutions are generically resonant, entailing both eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues, or, equivalently, both D-branes and negative-tension D-branes -- but are otherwise intricate to write down, having been previously addressed on a case-by-case approach. This work shows how there is a general and rather compact way to write down all these exact and fully nonperturbative transseries solutions in closed-form, immediately starting from the spectral geometry of the matrix model or string theory at hand, in the form of a discrete Fourier or Zak transform for their partition functions. This structure is inherently associated to the existence of anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes. The validity of these solutions is testable across all values of the parameters -- from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling, from small to large N; equivalently, from semi-classical to deeply quantum regimes -- and many such nonperturbative tests are performed against diverse examples ranging from matrix models to non-critical strings, fully validating our analytical and exact expressions. In particular, anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes are absolutely required to find sharp numerical matches. In order to study these solutions globally across their phase diagrams, however, complete non-linear Stokes data is still needed -- which will be addressed in a complementary follow-up paper.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving &amp; objective discretisation of SO(3)-matrix rotation fields for finite Cosserat micropolar continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method, dubbed \textbf{\textit{Geometric Structure-Preserving Interpolation ({\Gamma}-SPIN)}}, to simultaneously preserve physics-constraints inherent in the material parameter limits of the finite-strain Cosserat micropolar model, and satisfy objectivity under superimposed rigid body motions. The method advocates to interpolate the Cosserat rotation tensor using geodesic elements, which maintain objectivity and correctly represent curvature measures. At the same time, it proposes relaxing the interaction between the rotation tensor and the deformation tensor to alleviate locking effects. This relaxation is achieved in two steps. First, the regularity of the Cosserat rotation tensor is reduced by interpolating it into the N\'ed\'elec space. Second, the resulting field is projected back onto the Lie-group of rotations. Together, these steps define a lower-regularity projection-based interpolation. This construction allows the discrete Cosserat rotation tensor to match the polar part of the discrete deformation tensor while remaining objective. This ensures stable behaviour in the asymptotic regime as the Cosserat couple modulus tends to infinity, which constrains the model towards its couple-stress limit. We establish the consistency, stability, and optimality of the proposed method through several benchmark problems. The study culminates in a demonstration of its efficacy on a more intricate curved domain, contrasted with outcomes obtained from conventional interpolation techniques.</description>

      <title>Environment-Driven Emergence of Higher-Order Collective Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective behavior is commonly attributed to direct interactions among system components. Using a minimal stochastic model, we show that higher-order collective structure can instead emerge from shared stochastic environments, even in the absence of interactions. Quantified via the O-information, environmental fluctuations induce both redundant and synergistic dependencies, with the latter occupying larger regions of the correlation space. We establish a no-go theorem showing that time-independent coupling between the system variables and a shared stochastic environment rules out synergistic higher-order behavior. Crucially, this constraint can be overcome dynamically: transitions between redundancy and synergy arise from time-dependent environmental coupling or from the nontrivial interplay between shared environments and direct interactions. Together, these results identify environmental mediation as a distinct mechanism of higher-order collective organization beyond the conventional interaction-centric paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While $CP^N$ models with analytic potentials are known to support finite-energy compact Q-ball and Q-shell solutions, their behavior in more complex Lagrangian frameworks remains a subject of active research. This work explores these non-topological structures within an extended Skyrme-Faddeev-type model that incorporates quartic derivative terms. In this context, harmonic time dependence and the presence of quartic terms constitute two independent stabilization mechanisms that allow the configurations to circumvent Derrick's scaling argument. We investigate the necessary conditions for the existence of these solutions and analyze the influence of quartic terms on the properties of the resulting compactons, specifically examining the $E(Q)$ relationship between energy and Noether charge. Our findings provide valuable insights into the stability and characteristics of compact boson stars within $CP^N$ models featuring higher-order derivative terms.</description>

      <title>On the efficiency of pairwise Hamiltonian control to desynchronize the higher-order Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is observed in many natural and engineered systems and emerges due to the interactions within the system. It can be both beneficial, e.g., in power grids, and harmful, e.g., in epileptic seizures. In the latter case, efficient control methods to desynchronize the systems are crucial. Recent studies have shown that interactions are not always pairwise, but higher-order, i.e., many-body, and this greatly affects the dynamics. For instance, higher-order interactions increase the linear stability of synchronized states but simultaneously shrink their attraction basin, with potentially opposite effects on control methods. Here, we use a minimally invasive pairwise control based on Hamiltonian control theory, and investigate its efficiency on phase oscillators with higher-order interactions. We show that, if the initial phases are close to the synchronized state, higher-order interactions make desynchronization more difficult to achieve. Otherwise, a non-monotonic effect appears: intermediate strengths of higher-order interactions impede desynchronization while larger ones facilitate it. In all cases, the control can desynchronize the system with a sufficient number of controlled nodes and intensity.</description>

      <title>Passive Imaging with Ambient Noise Under Wave Speed Mismatch: Mathematical Analysis and Wave Speed Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that waves generated by ambient noise sources and recorded by passive receivers can be used to image the reflectivities of an unknown medium. However, reconstructing the reflectivity of the medium from partial boundary measurements remains a challenging problem, particularly when the background wave speed is unknown. In this paper, we investigate passive correlation-based imaging in the daylight configuration, where uncontrolled noise sources illuminate the medium and only ambient fields are recorded by a sensor array. We first analyze daylight migration for a point reflector embedded in a homogeneous background. By introducing a searching wave speed into the migration functional, we derive an explicit characterization of the deterministic shift and defocusing effects induced by wave-speed mismatch. We show that the maximum of the envelope of the resulting functional provides a reliable estimator of the true wave speed. We then extend the analysis to a random medium with correlation length smaller than the wavelength. Leveraging the shift formula obtained in the homogeneous case, we introduce a virtual guide star that remains fixed under migration with different searching speeds. This property enables an effective wave-speed estimation strategy based on spatial averaging around the virtual guide star. For both homogeneous and random media, we establish resolution analyses for the proposed wave-speed estimators. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical result.</description>

      <title>Quantitative enstrophy bounds for measure vorticities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with measure initial vorticity. By means of improved Nash inequalities, we establish quantitative estimates for the enstrophy depending on the absolute vorticity decay on balls. The bounds are optimal in several aspects and yield to a conjecturally sharp rate of the dissipation in the Delort's class.</description>

      <title>Timelike bounce hypersurfaces in charged null dust collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish results on the dynamics of interacting charged null fluids in general relativity, specifically in the context of the bouncing continuation proposed in [Ori91]. In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $\gamma$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{\mu\nu})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Vaidya regions. Across $\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{\mu\nu}\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition.</description>

      <title>Displacement general solutions in strain gradient elasticity: review and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide an overview of general solutions for displacement fields in static problems of isotropic strain gradient elasticity (SGE). We not only review existing solutions but also derive new representations, showing that all classical elasticity solutions - including those of Boussinesq-Galerkin, Papkovich-Neuber, Naghdi, Lame, Love and Boussinesq - can be simply generalized to SGE framework. In general, it is shown that SGE enables the use of any classical general solution representation combined with a Helmholtz decomposition for the gradient part of the displacement field. Consistency is also established between the presented Papkovich-Neuber representation and the general solutions of SGE proposed previously by Mindlin (1964), Lurie et al. (2006) and Charalambopoulos et al. (2020). Furthermore, we establish the relationships between the stress functions of different general solutions and show their completeness.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in the Dicke subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a complete mathematical theory for the entanglement of mixtures of Dicke states. These quantum states form an important subclass of bosonic states arising in the study of indistinguishable particles. We introduce a tensor-based parametrization where the diagonal entries of these states are encoded as a symmetric tensor, enabling a direct translation between entanglement properties and well-studied convex cones of tensors. Our results bridge multipartite entanglement theory with semialgebraic geometry and the theory of completely positive and copositive tensors. This dictionary maps separability to completely positive tensors, the PPT property to moment tensors, entanglement witnesses to copositive tensors, and decomposable witnesses to sum of squares tensors. Using this framework, we construct explicit PPT entangled states in three or more qutrits. In this class of states, we establish that PPT entanglement exists for all multipartite systems with three qutrits or more, disproving a recent conjecture in [J. Math. Phys. 66, 022203 (2025)]. We also show that, for mixtures of Dicke states, the PPT condition with respect to the most balanced bipartition implies PPT with respect to any other bipartition. We further connect bosonic extendibility of mixtures of Dicke states to the duals of known hierarchies for non-negative polynomials, such as the ones by Reznick and Polya. We thus provide semidefinite programming relaxations for separability and entanglement testing in the Dicke subspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider a stationary $N$-dimensional Galerkin-Navier-Stokes type evolution with Brownian forcing and random stirring (of arbitrarily small strength). We show that the stationary diffusion in an open two-dimensional cone constructed in a companion article, stands as the inviscid limit of the laws of the ``enstrophy-energy'' process of the $N$-dimensional diffusion process considered here, this regardless of the strength of the stirring. With the help of the quantitative condensation bounds of the companion article, we infer quantitative inviscid condensation bounds, which for suitable forcings show an attrition of all but the lowest modes in the inviscid limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we use Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^N$ to define the coefficients of an elliptic diffusion on an open cone of $\mathbb{R}^2$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary distribution for this diffusion. In a companion article, we show that the diffusion constructed in this work is the inviscid limit of the laws of the ``enstrophy-energy'' process of a stationary $N$-dimensional Galerkin-Navier-Stokes type evolution with Brownian forcing and random stirring (the strength of which can be made to go to zero in the inviscid limit). In the present work, owing to the special properties of the coefficients constructed with the Gaussian measure, we bound the distance to $1$ of the ratio of the expected energy to the expected enstrophy (this ratio is at most $1$ with our normalization). Together with our companion article, this shows that for suitable Brownian forcings an inviscid condensation inducing an attrition of all but the lowest modes takes place.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on density manifolds from reciprocal relations in hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics describes the evolution of macroscopic states in non--equilibrium thermodynamics. Following Onsager reciprocal relations, one can formulate a large class of hydrodynamic equations as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, such Onsager gradient flows have been extensively investigated on optimal transport type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, known as hydrodynamical density manifolds. A typical example is the gradient--drift Fokker--Planck equation, which can be characterized as the gradient flow of the free energy in the Wasserstein-2 metric space. This paper studies geometric calculations on general hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate the associated Levi--Civita connections, gradients, Hessians, and parallel transports, and then derive the corresponding Riemannian and sectional curvatures. Finally, we obtain closed-form formulas for sectional curvatures in one dimensional density manifolds, where the signs of the curvatures are determined by the convexity of the mobility functions. As illustrations, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures for several zero range models, including independent particle systems, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis--Marchioro--Presutti models.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Dirac Equation in the Metric Affine Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the most general form of Dirac equation in the non$-$Riemannian spacetimes containing curvature, torsion and non$-$metricity. It includes all bases of the Clifford algebra $cl(1,3)$ within the spinor connection. We adopt two approaches. First, the generalized Dirac equation is directly formulated by applying the minimal coupling prescription to the original Dirac equation. It is referred to as the {\it direct Dirac equation} for seek of clarity and to preserve the tractability. Second, through the application of variational calculation to the original Dirac Lagrangian, the resulting Dirac equation is referred to as the {\it variational Dirac equation}. A consistency crosscheck is performed between these two approaches, leading to novel constraints on the arbitrary coupling constants appearing in the covariant derivative of spinor. Following short analysis on the generalized Dirac Lagrangian, it is observed that two of the novel terms give rise to a shift in the spinor mass by sensing its handedness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalism, we propose a Poisson bracket for the electromagnetic field that, in addition to satisfying the restricted principle of relativity, reproduces well-established results from the standard formulations of field theories. To this end, it is necessary to translate the multisymplectic description of the system to the field's momentum representation, where a bilinear and Lorentz-covariant form emerges in a straightforward manner. Consequently, we establish a description for a system consisting of an electromagnetic field and a point particle interacting with each other that is based on a single Lorentz-covariant Poisson bracket with respect to all the canonical variables of the system. The results obtained from this proposal offer a solid foundation for the development of a Lorentz-covariant quantization process.</description>

Abstract: We compute the leading order asymptotic of the maximum of the characteristic polynomial for i.i.d. matrices with real or complex entries. In particular, this result is new even for real Ginibre matrices, which was left as an open problem in [arXiv:2303.09912]; the complex Ginibre case was covered in [arXiv:1902.01983]. These are the first universality results for the non--Hermitian analog of the first order term of the Fyodorov--Hiary--Keating conjecture. Our methods are based on constructing a coupling to the branching random walk via Dyson Brownian motion. In particular, we find a new connection between real i.i.d. matrices and inhomogeneous branching random walk.</description>

      <title>Equivalence functors in graded supergeometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that the category of N-manifolds of degree $n$, that is, $\mathbb N$-graded supermanifolds of degree $n$ for which the parity agrees with the gradation, is equivalent to the category of purely even $n$-tuple vector superbundles equipped with a suitable action of the symmetric group $S_n$ permuting the vector bundle structures. This equivalence may be interpreted as a `desuperization' of N-manifolds. In the present paper, we place this result within a broader framework of graded structures on supermanifolds and explicitly describe several canonical equivalences between the corresponding categories in a purely geometric, constructive manner. The desuperization equivalence functor appears as a composition of some of these canonical equivalences. Our constructions are entirely canonical and rely on standard tools of supergeometry, including iterated tangent functors, parity reversion in vector superbundles, and the interpretation of $n$-tuple vector bundles in terms of commuting Euler vector fields associated with the underlying vector bundle structures.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses Faber-Krahn-type inequalities for quantum dot Dirac operators with nonnegative mass on bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that this family of inequalities is equivalent to a family of Faber-Krahn-type inequalities for $\overline\partial$-Robin Laplacians. Thanks to this, we prove them in the case of simply connected domains for quantum dot boundary conditions asymptotically close to zigzag boundary conditions. Finally, we also study the case of negative mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The maximal gauged supergravities in five spacetime dimensions with gauge groups contained in $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are described. The $\textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ factor is the duality group of ungauged maximal supergravity and $\mathbb{R}^+$ is the scaling symmetry of the five-dimensional metric, usually called the \textit{trombone} symmetry. The equations of motion and supersymmetry variations for these supergravities are given to lowest order in fermions, and the mass matrices are provided. Then, the theories with gauge groups contained in a maximal subgroup of $\mathbb{R}^+ \times \textrm{E}_{6(6)}$ are classified, and a new family of such supergravities uncovered. For a concrete theory in this class, some supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua are found and their mass spectra computed within the gauged supergravity. These vacua are argued to be related to superconformal phases of the M5-brane field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lubrication theory makes use of the assumptions of a long and thin fluid domain and a small scaled Reynolds number to formulate a linearized approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. Extended lubrication theory aims to improve the model accuracy by relaxing these assumptions and including additional terms in the formulation. However, such models are sensitive to large surface gradients which lead the assumptions of the model to break down. In this paper, we present a formulation of extended lubrication theory, and compare our model with several existing models, along with the numerical solution to the Stokes equations. The error in pressure and velocity is characterized for a variety of fluid domain geometries. Our results indicate that the new solution is suitable for a wide range of geometries. The magnitude of surface variation and the length scale ratio are both important factors influencing the accuracy of the extended lubrication theory models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the holding of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke for a family of four-dimensional discrete dynamical systems that are naturally associated to ODE systems describing coupled oscillators subject to an external non-conservative force, also giving an example of a discrete map that is Li-Yorke chaotic but not topologically transitive. Analytical results are generalized to a modular definition of the problem and to a system of nonlinear oscillators described by polynomial potentials in one coordinate. We perform numerical simulations looking for a strange attractor of the system; furthermore, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the system presenting 1D and 2D bifurcation diagrams, together with spectra of Lyapunov exponents and basins of attraction.</description>

      <title>Positive Genus Pairs from Amplituhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11142</link>

Abstract: A main conjecture in the field of Positive Geometry states that amplituhedra, which are certain semi-algebraic sets in the Grassmannian, are positive geometries. It is motivated by examples showing that the canonical forms of certain amplituhedra compute scattering amplitudes in particle physics. Beyond a small number of special cases, this conjecture is still open. In recent work, Brown and Dupont introduced a new framework, based on mixed Hodge theory, connecting canonical forms and de Rham cohomology via genus zero pairs. We give short proofs that the amplituhedron gives rise to a genus zero pair in the cases when it is known to be a positive geometry. However, in the general case we show that amplituhedra inside the Grassmannian give rise to pairs of strictly positive genus. We provide an explicit example of a genus one pair arising from a positive geometry in projective space, showing that having genus zero is not a necessary condition to be a positive geometry. Finally, we show that this positive geometry still gives rise to a genus zero pair in a different ambient variety.</description>

      <title>Fast Solver for the Reynolds Equation on Piecewise Linear Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation is derived from the incompressible Navier Stokes equations under the lubrication assumptions of a long and thin domain geometry and a small scaled Reynolds number. The Reynolds equation is an elliptic differential equation and a dramatic simplification from the governing equations. When the fluid domain is piecewise linear, the Reynolds equation has an exact solution that we formulate by coupling the exact solutions of each piecewise component. We consider a formulation specifically for piecewise constant heights, and a more general formulation for piecewise linear heights; in both cases the linear system is inverted using the Schur complement. These methods can also be applied in the case of non-linear heights by approximating the height as piecewise constant or piecewise linear, in which case the methods achieve second order accuracy. We assess the time complexity of the two methods, and determine that the method for piecewise linear heights is linear time for the number of piecewise components. As an application of these methods, we explore the limits of validity for lubrication theory by comparing the solutions of the Reynolds and the Stokes equations for a variety of linear and non-linear textured slider geometries.</description>

      <title>The metaplectic semigroup and its applications to time-frequency analysis and evolution operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic analysis of the metaplectic semigroup $\mathrm{Mp}_+(d,\mathbb{C})$ associated with positive complex symplectic matrices, a notion introduced almost simultaneously and independently by H\"ormander, Brunet, Kramer, and Howe, thereby extending the classical metaplectic theory beyond the unitary setting.
  While the existing literature has largely focused on propagators of quadratic evolution equations, for which results are typically obtained via Mehler formulas, our approach is operator-theoretic and symplectic in spirit and adapts techniques from the standard metaplectic group $\mathrm{Mp}(d,\mathbb{R})$ to a substantially broader framework that is not driven by differential problems or particular propagators.
  This point of view provides deeper insight into the structure of the metaplectic semigroup, and allows us to investigate its generators, polar decomposition, and intertwining relations with complex conjugation and with the Wigner distribution. We then exploit these structural results to characterize, from a metaplectic perspective, classes of time-frequency representations satisfying prescribed structural properties. Finally, we discuss further implications for parabolic equations with complex quadratic Hamiltonians, we study the boundedness of their propagators on modulation spaces, we obtain estimates in time of their operator norms. Finally, we apply our theory to the study of propagation of Wigner singularities.</description>

      <title>Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative $L_p$-differentiability and trace formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a semifinite von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful semifinite trace $\tau$, and let $L_p(\mathcal{M})$ denote the associated noncommutative $L_p$-space for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and let $a, b$ be $\tau$-measurable self-adjoint operators such that $b\in L_p(\mathcal{M})\cap L_{np}(\mathcal{M})$. For a function $f\in C^n(\mathbb{R})$ whose derivatives $f^{(k)}$ are bounded for $1\le k\le n$, we prove that the map $\phi:t\in\mathbb{R}\mapsto f(a+tb)-f(a)$ is $n$-times differentiable in the $\|\cdot\|_{L_p}$-norm. This strengthens the corresponding result of de Pagter and Sukochev for $p\neq 2$ and extends it to higher-order derivatives. In addition, if $f^{(n)}\in C_0(\mathbb{R})$ or $b\in \mathcal{M}$, then $\phi^{(n)}$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. Consequently, we extend the Potapov--Skripka--Sukochev higher-order trace formula from bounded $L_n$-perturbations to not necessarily bounded perturbations in $L_n(\mathcal{M})\cap L_{n^{2}}(\mathcal{M})$. Moreover, we show that this trace formula holds for a broader class of admissible functions than the classes previously considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description>
