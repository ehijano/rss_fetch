      <title>Approximating Nash Equilibria in General-Sum Games via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nash equilibrium is perhaps the best-known solution concept in game theory. Such a solution assigns a strategy to each player which offers no incentive to unilaterally deviate. While a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to always exist, the problem of finding one in general-sum games is PPAD-complete, generally considered intractable. Regret minimization is an efficient framework for approximating Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. However, in general-sum games, such algorithms are only guaranteed to converge to a coarse-correlated equilibrium (CCE), a solution concept where players can correlate their strategies. In this work, we use meta-learning to minimize the correlations in strategies produced by a regret minimizer. This encourages the regret minimizer to find strategies that are closer to a Nash equilibrium. The meta-learned regret minimizer is still guaranteed to converge to a CCE, but we give a bound on the distance to Nash equilibrium in terms of our meta-loss. We evaluate our approach in general-sum imperfect information games. Our algorithms provide significantly better approximations of Nash equilibria than state-of-the-art regret minimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Welfare and Beyond in Multi-Agent Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal delegates a project to a team $S$ from a pool of $n$ agents. The project's value if all agents in $S$ exert costly effort is $f(S)$. To incentivize the agents to participate, the principal assigns each agent $i\in S$ a share $\rho_i\in [0,1]$ of the project's final value (i.e., designs $n$ linear contracts). The shares must be feasible -- their sum should not exceed $1$. It is well-understood how to design these contracts to maximize the principal's own expected utility, but what if the goal is to coordinate the agents toward maximizing social welfare?
  We initiate a systematic study of multi-agent contract design with objectives beyond principal's utility, including welfare maximization, for various classes of value functions $f$. Our exploration reveals an arguably surprising fact: If $f$ is up to XOS in the complement-free hierarchy of functions, then the optimal principal's utility is a constant-fraction of the optimal welfare. This is in stark contrast to the much larger welfare-utility gaps in auction design, and no longer holds above XOS in the hierarchy, where the gap can be unbounded.
  A constant bound on the welfare-utility gap immediately implies that existing algorithms for designing contracts with approximately-optimal principal's utility also guarantee approximately-optimal welfare. The downside of reducing welfare to utility is the loss of large constants. To obtain better guarantees, we develop polynomial-time algorithms directly for welfare, for different classes of value functions. These include a tight $2$-approximation to the optimal welfare for symmetric XOS functions.
  Finally, we extend our analysis beyond welfare to the project's value under general feasibility constraints. Our results immediately translate to budgeted welfare and utility.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning in Self-Play Regret Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regret minimization is a general approach to online optimization which plays a crucial role in many algorithms for approximating Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. The literature mainly focuses on solving individual games in isolation. However, in practice, players often encounter a distribution of similar but distinct games. For example, when trading correlated assets on the stock market, or when refining the strategy in subgames of a much larger game. Recently, offline meta-learning was used to accelerate one-sided equilibrium finding on such distributions. We build upon this, extending the framework to the more challenging self-play setting, which is the basis for most state-of-the-art equilibrium approximation algorithms for domains at scale. When selecting the strategy, our method uniquely integrates information across all decision states, promoting global communication as opposed to the traditional local regret decomposition. Empirical evaluation on normal-form games and river poker subgames shows our meta-learned algorithms considerably outperform other state-of-the-art regret minimization algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We model search in settings where decision makers know what can be found but not where to find it. A searcher faces a set of choices arranged by an observable attribute. Each period, she either selects a choice and pays a cost to learn about its quality, or she concludes search to take her best discovery to date. She knows that similar choices have similar qualities and uses this to guide her search. We identify robustly optimal search policies with a simple structure. Search is directional, recall is never invoked, there is a threshold stopping rule, and the policy at each history depends only on a simple index.</description>

      <title>How Group Lives Go Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the ontological space of group well being, proposing a framework for representing collective welfare, group functions, and long term contributions within an ontology engineering context. Traditional well being theories focus on individual states, often relying on hedonistic, desire satisfaction, or objective list models. Such approaches struggle to account for cases where individual sacrifices contribute to broader social progress, a critical challenge in modeling group flourishing. To address this, the paper refines and extends the Counterfactual Account (CT) of well being, which evaluates goodness of an event by comparing an individual's actual well being with a hypothetical counterpart in a nearby possible world. While useful, this framework is insufficient for group level ontologies, where well being depends on functional persistence, institutional roles, and historical impact rather than immediate individual outcomes. Drawing on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the paper introduces a model in which group flourishing is evaluated in terms of group functional, where members bear roles and exhibit persistence conditions akin to biological systems or designed artifacts. This approach enables semantic interoperability for modeling longitudinal social contributions, allowing for structured reasoning about group welfare, social institutions, and group flourishing over time.</description>

      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Online Allocation via Dynamic Max-min Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the allocation of shared resources over multiple rounds among competing agents, via the dynamic max-min fair (DMMF) mechanism: the good in each round is allocated to the requesting agent with the least number of allocations received to date. We show that in large markets when an agent has i.i.d. values across rounds, under mild distributional assumptions (e.g., bounded PDF function), the DMMF mechanism allows each agent to realize a $1 - o(1)$ fraction of her ideal utility -- her highest achievable utility given her nominal share of resources. This guarantee holds under arbitrary behavior by other agents and is achieved by characterizing the agent's utility under a rich space of strategies, wherein an agent can tune how aggressive to be in requesting the item. Our techniques also allow us to handle settings where an agent's values are correlated across rounds, thereby allowing an adversary to predict and block her future values. By tuning the aggressiveness, an agent can guarantee $\Omega(\gamma)$ fraction of her ideal utility, where $\gamma\in [0, 1]$ is a parameter that quantifies dependence across rounds (with $\gamma = 1$ indicating full independence and lower values indicating more correlation). Finally, we extend our efficiency results to the case of reusable resources, where an agent might need to hold the item over multiple rounds to receive utility. Our results subsume previous guarantees obtained using a more complicated mechanism proving a half ideal utility guarantee under i.i.d. values sampled from worst-case distributions.</description>

      <title>An extension of May's Theorem to three alternatives: axiomatizing Minimax voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: May's Theorem [K. O. May, Econometrica 20 (1952) 680-684] characterizes majority voting on two alternatives as the unique preferential voting method satisfying several simple axioms. Here we show that by adding some desirable axioms to May's axioms, we can uniquely determine how to vote on three alternatives (setting aside tiebreaking). In particular, we add two axioms stating that the voting method should mitigate spoiler effects and avoid the so-called strong no show paradox. We prove a theorem stating that any preferential voting method satisfying our enlarged set of axioms, which includes some weak homogeneity and preservation axioms, must choose from among the Minimax winners in all three-alternative elections. When applied to more than three alternatives, our axioms also distinguish Minimax from other known voting methods that coincide with or refine Minimax for three alternatives.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Societies via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17466v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are typically constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. We propose a methodology that enables simulating populations of Reinforcement Learning agents at evolutionary scale. More specifically, we derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Policy Gradient (PG) and Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), tailored for evolutionary simulations where agents undergo random pairwise interactions in stateless normal-form games. We demonstrate our approach by simulating the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. In our experiments, 200,000 PG or LOLA agents evolve in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game provides distinct insights into how populations evolve under both naive and advanced MARL rules, including compelling ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects social evolution.</description>

      <title>MetaTrading: An Immersion-Aware Model Trading Framework for Vehicular Metaverse Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Timely updating of Internet of Things (IoT) data is crucial for immersive vehicular metaverse services. However, challenges such as latency caused by massive data transmissions, privacy risks associated with user data, and computational burdens on metaverse service providers (MSPs) hinder continuous collection of high-quality data. To address these issues, we propose an immersion-aware model trading framework that facilitates data provision for services while ensuring privacy through federated learning (FL). Specifically, we first develop a novel multi-dimensional metric, the immersion of model (IoM), which assesses model value comprehensively by considering freshness and accuracy of learning models, as well as the amount and potential value of raw data used for training. Then, we design an incentive mechanism to incentivize metaverse users (MUs) to contribute high-value models under resource constraints. The trading interactions between MSPs and MUs are modeled as an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC) to analyze and balance their costs and gains, where MSPs as leaders determine rewards, while MUs as followers optimize resource allocation. Furthermore, considering dynamic network conditions and privacy concerns, we formulate the reward decisions of MSPs as a multi-agent Markov decision process. To solve this, we develop a fully distributed dynamic reward algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, without accessing any private information about MUs and other MSPs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving improvements in IoM of 38.3% and 37.2%, and reductions in training time to reach the target accuracy of 43.5% and 49.8%, on average, for the MNIST and GTSRB datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Collective Accuracy in Socially Connected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the accuracy of collective decision-making in socially connected populations, where agents update binary choices through local interactions on a network. Each agent receives a private signal that is biased -- even marginally -- toward the correct alternative, and social influence mediates the aggregation of these signals. We show analytically that, in the large-population limit, the probability of a correct majority converges to a nontrivial expression involving the regularized incomplete beta function. Remarkably, this collective accuracy surpasses that of any individual agent whenever private signals are better than random, revealing that network-mediated influence can enhance, rather than impair, group performance. Our findings may inform the design of resilient decision-making systems in social, biological, and engineered networks, where accuracy must emerge from interdependent and noisy agents.</description>
