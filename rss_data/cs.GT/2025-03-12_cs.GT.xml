      <title>Incentive Analysis for Agent Participation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning offers a decentralized approach to machine learning, where multiple agents collaboratively train a model while preserving data privacy. In this paper, we investigate the decision-making and equilibrium behavior in federated learning systems, where agents choose between participating in global training or conducting independent local training. The problem is first modeled as a stage game and then extended to a repeated game to analyze the long-term dynamics of agent participation. For the stage game, we characterize the participation patterns and identify Nash equilibrium, revealing how data heterogeneity influences the equilibrium behavior-specifically, agents with similar data qualities will participate in FL as a group. We also derive the optimal social welfare and show that it coincides with Nash equilibrium under mild assumptions. In the repeated game, we propose a privacy-preserving, computationally efficient myopic strategy. This strategy enables agents to make practical decisions under bounded rationality and converges to a neighborhood of Nash equilibrium of the stage game in finite time. By combining theoretical insights with practical strategy design, this work provides a realistic and effective framework for guiding and analyzing agent behaviors in federated learning systems.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Equilibrium Finding in Polymatrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equilibrium finding in polymatrix games under differential privacy constraints. To start, we show that high accuracy and asymptotically vanishing differential privacy budget (as the number of players goes to infinity) cannot be achieved simultaneously under either of the two settings: (i) We seek to establish equilibrium approximation guarantees in terms of Euclidean distance to the equilibrium set, and (ii) the adversary has access to all communication channels. Then, assuming the adversary has access to a constant number of communication channels, we develop a novel distributed algorithm that recovers strategies with simultaneously vanishing Nash gap (in expected utility, also referred to as exploitability and privacy budget as the number of players increases.</description>

      <title>Fair Play in the Fast Lane: Integrating Sportsmanship into Autonomous Racing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing has gained significant attention as a platform for high-speed decision-making and motion control. While existing methods primarily focus on trajectory planning and overtaking strategies, the role of sportsmanship in ensuring fair competition remains largely unexplored. In human racing, rules such as the one-motion rule and the enough-space rule prevent dangerous and unsportsmanlike behavior. However, autonomous racing systems often lack mechanisms to enforce these principles, potentially leading to unsafe maneuvers. This paper introduces a bi-level game-theoretic framework to integrate sportsmanship (SPS) into versus racing. At the high level, we model racing intentions using a Stackelberg game, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed to derive optimal strategies. At the low level, vehicle interactions are formulated as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP), ensuring that all agents follow sportsmanship constraints while optimizing their trajectories. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enforcing sportsmanship rules while maintaining competitive performance. We analyze different scenarios where attackers and defenders adhere to or disregard sportsmanship rules and show how knowledge of these constraints influences strategic decision-making. This work highlights the importance of balancing competition and fairness in autonomous racing and provides a foundation for developing ethical and safe AI-driven racing systems.</description>
