      <title>Isolation of Pu-isotopes from environmental samples using ion chromatography for accelerator mass spectrometry and alpha spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A radiochemical method for the isolation of plutonium isotopes from environmental samples, based on the use of specific chromatography resins for actinides (TEVA, Eichrom Industries), has been set up in our laboratory and optimised for their posterior determination by alpha spectrometry (AS) or accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The proposed radiochemical method has replaced in our lab a well established one based on the use of a relatively un-specific anion-exchange resin (AG1X8, Biorad), because it is clearly less time consuming, reduces the amounts and molarities of acid wastes produced, and reproducibly gives high radiochemical yields.
  In order to check the reliability of the proposed radiochemical method for the determination of plutonium isotopes in different environmental matrixes, twin aliquots of a set of samples were prepared with TEVA and with AG 1X8 resins and measured by AS. Some samples prepared with TEVA resins were measured as well by AMS. As it is shown in the text, there is a comfortable agreement between AS and AMS, which adequately validates the method.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the plutonium isotopic composition of a sediment core from Palomares, Spain, by low-energy AMS and alpha-spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, at 670 kV on the compact accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) system at the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Seville, Spain, is now a reality. In this work, we present first Pu AMS results for environmental samples: a sediment core collected in a submarine canyon in the Mediterranean coast of the Spanish region of Palomares, affected by a nuclear accident in 1966. From the study of the 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio profile, showing on average levels lower than 11%, we confirm that the weapon-grade plutonium released on land during the accident, with a characteristic 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratio of 5.8%, has found its way into the marine environment. A two-plutonium sources mixture model (Palomares and fallout) is used to elucidate the percentage of the plutonium coming from the accident. As a validation exercise of the Pu AMS measuring technique and in order to obtain the 238Pu/(239+240)Pu activity ratios, samples were also studied by alpha-spectrometry (AS). The obtained AS 239+240Pu activity concentration results fit in with the AMS ones in a wide dynamic range, thus validating the AMS technique.</description>

      <title>Design of a Large Area Digital SiPM with High Fill Factor and Fully Serial Digital Readout for Single Photon Detection in Liquid Noble Gas Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 'digital SiPM' photo-detection chip combining single photon sensitive avalanche photo diodes and CMOS readout electronics on a single die. The chip has a size of $8046\times9032\,\mu m^2$ with $72.5\%$ of photo sensitive area. It is subdivided into $32\times30$ pixels with an average size of $250\times291\,\mu m^2$. For each photon hit, the chip records the pixel coordinate and the arrival time with a granularity of $\approx 10\,ns$. Readout and chip control are purely digital, requiring only 4 CMOS signals. Several chips can be daisy chained and grouped on larger modules so that detector planes with $\approx70\%$ photo sensitive area can be build. Our chip may be used in experiments that need to detect rare scintillation events, for instance dark matter searches using liquid noble gases.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Radon-222 concentration in N2 using an activated charcoal trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14559v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radon-222 is a limiting background in many leading dark matter and low energy neutrino experiments. One way to mitigate Radon-222 is to fill external experimental components with a clean cover gas such as N2. At the SNOLAB facility in Canada, the 222Rn concentration in the cover gas systems of the experiments are monitored using a radon assay board developed by the SNO collaboration. To improve the sensitivity of N2 assays, a new trapping mechanism based on activated charcoal has been developed. The trap was purified and tested at SNOLAB. The methods for determining the efficiency, background, and sensitivity of the trap were described. Additionally, as part of the efficiency measurement, a radon calibration source was developed and characterized.</description>

      <title>Scintillating Fibre Detector for the Mu3e Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact scintillating fibre timing detector developed for the Mu3e experiment. Mu3e is one of the flagship experiments of the Swiss particle physics scene, aiming to search for the charged lepton flavour violating (neutrinoless) muon decay $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+e^-e^+$. Mu3e is planned to start taking data in 2025 at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, using the most intense continuous surface muon beam in the world (10$^8$ muons per second).
  At the University of Geneva, together with partners from ETH Zurich, we are developing a scintillating fibre detector formed by staggering three layers of 250 $\mu m$ diameter round scintillating fibres. The fibre ribbons are coupled at both ends to multi-channel silicon photo-multiplier arrays, which are read out with the MuTRiG ASIC, specifically developed for this experiment.
  This presentation is focused on the performances of the scintillating fibre detector, notably on the time resolution around 250 ps, the efficiency greater than 97\% and the spatial resolution of $\sim$ 100 $\mu m$. In this presentation, we also include the challenges overcome to build this very thin scintillating fibre detector, having a thickness smaller than 0.2\% of the radiation length. Furthermore, we discuss the operation and performance of the MuTRiG ASIC, used for reading out the 3072 channels of the fibre detector.</description>

      <title>The Mu3e Experiment: Status and Short-Term Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mu3e is an experiment currently under construction at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, designed to search for the Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) decay $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+e^-e^+$. In extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that account for neutrino masses, this decay is theoretically allowed but occurs only through extremely rare loop processes, with a predicted branching ratio of approximately $\mathcal{O}(10^{-54})$. Such a small probability implies that any observation of this decay would provide clear evidence for physics beyond the SM.
  The Mu3e experiment aims to probe the $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+e^-e^+$ decay with a sensitivity of approximately $\mathcal{O}(10^{-15})$ in its Phase-1 and plans to achieve a sensitivity of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})$ after future upgrades. To reach its Phase-1 ambitious goals, Mu3e is going to use the most intense continuous muon beam in the world, generating 10$^{8}$ muon stops per second in the target placed at the center of the Mu3e.
  Mu3e will use three main technologies for particle detection. The tracking will done through ultra-thin (50 - 70 $\mu m$) pixel detectors based on MuPix11 sensors. These are high-voltage monolithic active pixel sensors (HV-MAPS) with a $\sim$ 23~$\mu$m spatial resolution. The timing will be done through scintillating fibres ($\sim$ 250 ps) and tiles ($\sim$ 40 ps), coupled to silicon photomultipliers and read out by MuTRiG3 ASICs. A triggerless DAQ system based on FPGAs will collect data from the detectors, which will then undergo reconstruction in a GPU filter farm. The assembly of the detectors has started, with a detector commissioning beam time planned for 2025. This document reports on the status of the construction, installation, and data-taking plans for the near future.</description>

      <title>Upgrades and maintenance of the CRYRING@ESR electron cooler for improved internal electron target operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electron cooler of the CRYRING@ESR storage ring at the GSI-FAIR accelerator complex is a unique instrument, which not only provides beam cooling of the stored ions, but also serves as a low-energy electron target for Dielectronic Recombination experiments. The minimisation of vacuum contamination and the response to rapid energy changes are key requirements of the cooler in electron target mode. Therefore, a test bench was prepared to study the outgassing behaviour of the electron gun components and a setup was constructed to evaluate the drift-electrode-modulation of the acceleration voltage of the cooler. The vacuum studies showed that the electron gun cathode was severely malfunctioning and resulted in its replacement. The drift-electrode-modulation of the acceleration voltage showed significant improvements compared to direct modulation of the terminal voltage of the cooler.</description>

      <title>Emittance Minimization for Aberration Correction II: Physics-informed Bayesian Optimization of an Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-{\AA}ngstr\"om probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.</description>
