      <title>AIRMap - AI-Generated Radio Maps for Wireless Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, low-latency channel modeling is essential for real-time wireless network simulation and digital-twin applications. Traditional modeling methods like ray tracing are however computationally demanding and unsuited to model dynamic conditions. In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and building heights. Trained and evaluated on 60,000 Boston-area samples, spanning coverage areas from 500 m to 3 km per side, AIRMap predicts path gain with under 5 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S -over 7000x faster than GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error. Integration into the Colosseum emulator and the Sionna SYS platform demonstrate near-zero error in spectral efficiency and block-error rate compared to measurement-based channels. These findings validate AIRMap's potential for scalable, accurate, and real-time radio map estimation in wireless digital twins.</description>

      <title>Bridging Accuracy and Explainability in EEG-based Graph Attention Network for Depression Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression is a major cause of global mental illness and significantly influences suicide rates. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights. These studies highlight features, cerebral areas, and connectivity associations that are especially relevant to MDD, many of which correspond with clinical data. Our findings demonstrate a reliable and transparent method for EEG-based screening of MDD, using deep learning with clinically relevant results.</description>

      <title>Well-Designed k-Space Coverage is Important for Good MRI Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object: Modern computational MRI denoising approaches are often designed assuming fixed k-space coverage. This contrasts with earlier acquisition-design literature that leveraged k-space coverage modifications (e.g., reducing spatial resolution) to improve SNR. This work investigates whether the performance of modern computational denoising methods can be further enhanced by k-space coverage modifications.
  Materials and Methods: Using realistic simulations of noisy data, k-space coverage and averaging patterns were optimized for two advanced image denoising/reconstruction approaches: parallel imaging with total variation regularization and a U-Net neural network. For reference, comparisons against classical linear filtering/apodization methods were also performed. Performance was quantified using normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) and structural similarity (SSIM) metrics.
  Results: Advanced computational denoising methods can be substantially enhanced, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by reducing the spatial resolution of the acquisition to improve SNR. Indeed, even simple linear filtering/apodization with optimized k-space coverage can rival advanced methods using naive higher-resolution coverage.
  Discussion: Classical acquisition design principles that allow spatial resolution to be traded for SNR enhancement are still very relevant for modern computational denoising techniques. However, the optimization of k-space coverage and denoising/reconstruction methods can also be somewhat confounded because the NRMSE and SSIM metrics have low sensitivity to spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware MIMO Channel Estimation in Pilot-Constrained Upper Mid-Band Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation is critical for next-generation wireless systems, enabling enhanced communication and sensing performance. Traditional model-based channel estimation methods suffer, however, from performance degradation in complex environments with a limited number of pilots, while purely data-driven approaches lack physical interpretability, require extensive data collection, and are usually site-specific. This paper presents a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that combines model-based channel estimation with a deep network to exploit prior information about the propagation environment and achieve superior performance under pilot-constrained scenarios. The proposed approach employs an enhanced U-Net architecture with cross-attention mechanisms to fuse initial channel estimates with received signal strength (RSS) maps to provide refined channel estimates. Comprehensive evaluation using realistic ray-tracing data from urban environments demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving over 5 dB gain in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to state-of-the-art methods, with particularly strong performance in pilot-limited scenarios and robustness across different frequencies and environments with only minimal fine-tuning. The proposed framework maintains practical computational complexity, making it viable for massive MIMO systems in upper mid-band frequencies.</description>

      <title>Fast Time-Varying mmWave MIMO Channel Estimation and Reconstruction: An Efficient Rank-Aware Matrix Completion Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of fast time-varying channel estimation in millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems with imperfect channel state information (CSI) and facilitate efficient channel reconstruction. Specifically, leveraging the low-rank and sparse characteristics of the mmWave channel matrix, a two-phase rank-aware compressed sensing framework is proposed for efficient channel estimation and reconstruction. In the first phase, a robust rank-one matrix completion (R1MC) algorithm is used to reconstruct part of the observed channel matrix through low-rank matrix completion (LRMC). To address abrupt rank changes caused by user mobility, a discrete-time autoregressive (AR) model is established that leverages temporal rank correlations across consecutive time instances to enable adaptive observation matrix completion, thereby improving estimation accuracy under dynamic conditions. In the second phase, a rank-aware block orthogonal matching pursuit (RA-BOMP) algorithm is developed for sparse channel recovery with low computational complexity. Furthermore, a rank-aware measurement matrix design is introduced to improve angle estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with existing benchmark algorithms, the proposed approach achieves superior channel estimation performance while significantly reducing computational complexity and training overhead.</description>

      <title>RadioSim Agent: Combining Large Language Models and Deterministic EM Simulators for Interactive Radio Map Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic electromagnetic (EM) simulators provide accurate radio propagation modeling but often require expert configuration and lack interactive flexibility. We present RadioSim Agent, an agentic framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with physics-based EM solvers and vision-enabled reasoning to enable interactive and explainable radio map generation. The framework encapsulates ray-tracing models as callable simulation tools, orchestrated by an LLM capable of interpreting natural language objectives, managing simulation workflows, and visually analyzing resulting radio maps. Demonstrations in urban UAV communication scenarios show that the agent autonomously selects appropriate propagation mechanisms, executes deterministic simulations, and provides semantic and visual summaries of pathloss behavior. The results indicate that RadioSim Agent provides multimodal interpretability and intuitive user interaction, paving the way for intelligent EM simulation assistants in next-generation wireless system design.</description>

      <title>Near-field Anchor-free Localization using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field localization is expected to play a crucial role in enabling a plethora of applications under the paradigm of 6G networks. The conventional localization methods rely on complex infrastructure for providing cooperative anchor nodes that often contribute to higher network overload and energy consumption. To address this, the passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be leveraged as perfectly synced reference nodes for developing anchor-free localization. This work proposes a two-stage framework for localizing user equipment (UE) equipped with multiple antennas. At first, we show that the optimal RIS phase shift matrix maximizing the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for RIS-assisted anchor-free localization is independent of UE location, making the proposed framework scalable without increasing the overhead to control RIS. The proposed two-stage framework first obtains a coarse estimate of UE's location by correlating the received RIS-reflected signal with a dictionary constructed using line-of-sight (LoS) components at a few reference positions. Next, the coarse estimate is refined using Newton's refinement. The numerical results show that the small-sized dictionary, constructed using fewer reference positions, can be employed for accurate localization with a slight increase in the required number of refinement iterations.</description>

      <title>Invariants in Eddy Current Testing via Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Buckingham's $\pi$, theorem has been recently introduced in the context of Non destructive Testing \&amp; Evaluation (NdT\&amp;E) , giving a theoretical basis for developing simple but effective methods for multi-parameter estimation via dimensional analysis. Dimensional groups, or $\pi-$groups, allow for the reduction of the number of parameters affecting the dimensionless measured quantities.
  In many real-world applications, the main interest is in estimating only a subset of the variables affecting the measurements. An example is estimating the thickness and electrical conductivity of a plate from Eddy Current Testing data, regardless of the lift-off of the probe, which may be either uncertain and/or variable. Alternatively, one may seek to estimate thickness and lift-off while neglecting the influence of the electrical conductivity, or to estimate the electrical conductivity and the lift-off, neglecting the thickness.
  This is where the concept of invariants becomes crucial. An invariant transformation is a mathematical mapping that makes the measured signal independent of one or more of these uncertain parameters. Invariant transformations provide a way to isolate useful signals from uncertain ones, improving the accuracy and reliability of the NdT results.
  The main contribution of this paper is a systematic method to derive \emph{invariant} transformations for frequency domain Eddy Current Testing data, via dimensional analysis. The proposed method is compatible with real-time and in-line operations.
  After its theoretical foundation is introduced, the method is validated by means of experimental data, with reference to configurations consisting of plates with different thicknesses, electrical conductivity, and lift-off. The experimental validation proves the effectiveness of the method in achieving excellent accuracy on a wide range of parameters of interest.</description>

      <title>Towards Human-AI-Robot Collaboration and AI-Agent based Digital Twins for Parkinson's Disease Management: Review and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current body of research on Parkinson's disease (PD) screening, monitoring, and management has evolved along two largely independent trajectories. The first research community focuses on multimodal sensing of PD-related biomarkers using noninvasive technologies such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), force/pressure insoles, electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), speech and acoustic analysis, and RGB/RGB-D motion capture systems. These studies emphasize data acquisition, feature extraction, and machine learning-based classification for PD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression modeling. In parallel, a second research community has concentrated on robotic intervention and rehabilitation, employing socially assistive robots (SARs), robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) systems, and virtual reality (VR)-integrated robotic platforms for improving motor and cognitive function, enhancing social engagement, and supporting caregivers. Despite the complementary goals of these two domains, their methodological and technological integration remains limited, with minimal data- level or decision-level coupling between the two. With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, a unique opportunity now exists to unify these research streams. We envision a closed-loop sensor-AI-robot framework in which multimodal sensing continuously guides the interaction between the patient, caregiver, humanoid robot (and physician) through AI agents that are powered by a multitude of AI models such as robotic and wearables foundation models, LLM-based reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning. Such closed-loop system enables personalized, explainable, and context-aware intervention, forming the basis for digital twin of the PD patient that can adapt over time to deliver intelligent, patient-centered PD care.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Modular Bayesian Deep Receivers: Single-Step Adaptation with Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based receivers offer a powerful alternative to classical model-based designs for wireless communication, especially in complex and nonlinear propagation environments. However, their adoption is challenged by the rapid variability of wireless channels, which makes pre-trained static DNN-based receivers ineffective, and by the latency and computational burden of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based learning. In this work, we propose an online learning framework that enables rapid low-complexity adaptation of DNN-based receivers. Our approach is based on two main tenets. First, we cast online learning as Bayesian tracking in parameter space, enabling a single-step adaptation, which deviates from multi-epoch SGD . Second, we focus on modular DNN architectures that enable parallel, online, and localized variational Bayesian updates. Simulations with practical communication channels demonstrate that our proposed online learning framework can maintain a low error rate with markedly reduced update latency and increased robustness to channel dynamics as compared to traditional gradient descent based method.</description>

      <title>Positioning Using LEO Satellite Communication Signals Under Orbital Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites offer a promising alternative to global navigation satellite systems for precise positioning; however, their relatively low altitudes make them more susceptible to orbital perturbations, which in turn degrade positioning accuracy. In this work, we study LEO-based positioning under orbital errors within a signal-of-opportunity framework. First, we introduce a LEO orbit model that accounts for Earth's non-sphericity and derive a wideband communication model that captures fast- and slow-time Doppler effects and multipath propagation. Subsequently, we perform a misspecified Cram\'er-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis to evaluate the impact of orbital errors on positioning performance. Then, we propose a two-stage positioning method starting with a (i) MCRB-based weighted orbit calibration, followed by (ii) least-squares user positioning using the corrected orbit. The MCRB analysis indicates that orbital errors can induce kilometer-level position biases. Extensive simulations show that the proposed estimator can considerably enhance the positioning accuracy relative to the orbit-mismatched baseline, yielding errors on the order of a few meters.</description>

      <title>Hierarchically Block-Sparse Recovery With Prior Support Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new recovery bounds for hierarchical compressed sensing (HCS) based on prior support information (PSI). A detailed PSI-enabled reconstruction model is formulated using various forms of PSI. The hierarchical block orthogonal matching pursuit with PSI (HiBOMP-P) algorithm is designed in a recursive form to reliably recover hierarchically block-sparse signals. We derive exact recovery conditions (ERCs) measured by the mutual incoherence property (MIP), wherein hierarchical MIP concepts are proposed, and further develop reconstructible sparsity levels to reveal sufficient conditions for ERCs. Leveraging these MIP analyses, we present several extended insights, including reliable recovery conditions in noisy scenarios and the optimal hierarchical structure for cases where sparsity is not equal to zero. Our results further confirm that HCS offers improved recovery performance even when the prior information does not overlap with the true support set, whereas existing methods heavily rely on this overlap, thereby compromising performance if it is absent.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning-Driven GFlowNets for 3D Directional Modulation in Mobile Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our prior work we have proposed the use of GFlowNets, a generative AI (GenAI) framework, for designing a secure communication system comprising a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS). However, GFlowNet-based approaches assume static environments, limiting their applicability in mobile wireless networks. In this paper, we proposes a novel Meta-GFlowNet framework that achieves rapid adaptation to dynamic conditions using model-agnostic meta-learning. As the communication user is moving, the framework learns a direction-general prior across user directions via inner trajectory-balance updates and outer meta-updates, enabling quick convergence to new user directions. The approach requires no labeled data, employing a pseudo-supervised consistency objective derived from the learned reward by GFlowNet and the actual sum-rate reward of the TM-IRS system. Simulation results show that the proposed method attains faster adaptation and higher secrecy performance than retrained GFlowNets, offering an efficient GenAI framework for dynamic wireless environments. Although the scenario considered here focuses on directional modulation-based physical-layer security, the proposed framework can also be applied to other mobile wireless systems, such as joint sensing-communication networks, that utilize GFlowNets.</description>

      <title>Fast Reconstruction of Motion-Corrupted Data with Mobile-GRAPPA: Motion and dB0 Inhomogeneity Correction Leveraging Efficient GRAPPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced motion navigations now enable rapid tracking of subject motion and dB0-induced phase, but accurately incorporating this high-temporal-resolution information into SENSE (Aligned-SENSE) is often computationally prohibitive. We propose "Mobile-GRAPPA", a k-space "cleaning" approach that uses local GRAPPA operators to remove motion and dB0 related corruption so that the resulting data can be reconstructed with standard SENSE. We efficiently train a family of k-space-position-specific Mobile-GRAPPA kernels via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) and apply them across k-space to generate clean data. In experiments on highly motion-corrupted 1-mm whole-brain GRE (Tacq = 10 min; 1,620 motion/dB0 trackings) and EPTI (Tacq = 2 min; 544 trackings), Mobile-GRAPPA enabled accurate reconstruction with negligible time penalty, whereas full Aligned-SENSE was impractical (reconstruction times &gt; 10 h for GRE and &gt; 10 days for EPTI). These results show that Mobile-GRAPPA incorporates detailed motion and dB0 tracking into SENSE with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast, high-quality reconstructions of challenging data.</description>

      <title>Blocker-Aware Beamforming and Dynamic Power Allocation for Multicarrier ISAC-NOMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a blocker-aware multicarrier integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-non orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, leveraging hybrid beamforming and dynamic power allocation to enhance spectrum efficiency in 6G networks. Recognizing the performance degradation caused by environmental blockers, the system introduces a joint waveform design that ensures robust operation under varying channel conditions. A channel switching mechanism is deployed to reroute communication through alternative non-line-of-sight paths when the primary line-of-sight links are obstructed. Moreover, a dynamic power allocation strategy enforces a minimum rate constraint for the weak NOMA user, ensuring consistent quality of service. Extensive simulations over multiple blockage scenarios and signal to noise (SNR) conditions validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Notably, under severe blockage, the system achieves up to a 400% sensing rate enhancement at 15 dB SNR, with only a 20% reduction in communication rate. These results corroborate the system's ability to adapt and optimize joint sensing-communication performance in practical deployment environments.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate and Worst Case SINR Optimization in Multi HAPS Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing throughput and fairness promises to be a key enabler for achieving large-scale digital inclusion in future vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets). In an attempt to address the global digital divide problem, this paper explores a multi-high-altitude platform system (HAPS)-ground integrated network, in which multiple HAPSs collaborate with ground base stations (BSs) to enhance the users' quality of service on the ground to achieve the highly sought-after digital equity. To this end, this paper considers maximizing both the network-wide weighted sum rate function and the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) function subject to the same system level constraints. More specifically, the paper tackles the two different optimization problems so as to balance throughput and fairness, by accounting for the individual HAPS payload connectivity constraints, HAPS and BS distinct power limitations, and per-user rate requirements. This paper solves the considered problems using techniques from optimization theory by adopting a generalized assignment problem (GAP)-based methodology to determine the user association variables, jointly with successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithms for optimizing the corresponding beamforming vectors. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithms is their amenability for distributed implementation across the multiple HAPSs and BSs. The simulation results particularly validate the performance of the presented algorithms, demonstrating the capability of multi-HAPS networks to boost-up the overall network digital inclusion toward democratizing future digital services.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg Game-Driven Defense for ISAC Against Channel Attacks in Low-Altitude Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing saturation of terrestrial resources has driven economic activities into low-altitude airspace. These activities, such as air taxis, rely on low-altitude wireless networks, and one key enabling technology is integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, in low-altitude airspace, ISAC is vulnerable to channel-access attacks, thereby degrading performance and threatening safety. To address this, we propose a defense framework based on a Stackelberg game. Specifically, we first model the system under attack, deriving metrics for the communication and the sensing to quantify performance. Then, we formulate the interaction as a three-player game where a malicious attacker acts as the leader, while the legitimate drone and ground base station act as followers. Using a backward induction algorithm, we obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium, allowing the defenders to dynamically adjust their strategies to mitigate the attack. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm converges to a stable solution and outperforms existing baselines, ensuring reliable ISAC performance for critical low-altitude applications.</description>

      <title>CSIT-Free Multi-Group Multicast Transmission in Overloaded mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the downlink multi-group multicast (MGM) transmission problem in overloaded mmWave systems. In particular, the conventional MGM beamforming requires substantial computational complexity and feedback (or pilot) overhead for acquisition of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), while simultaneous interference management and multicast beamforming optimization across multi-group inevitably incurs a significant rate loss. To address this, we propose a CSIT-free MGM (CF-MGM) transmission that eliminates the need for a complex CSIT acquisition. A deterministic CSIT-free precoding and proposed closed-form power allocation based on max-min fairness (MMF) allow each user to detect the common multicast stream completely canceling the inter-group interference with a significantly low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and scalability of the proposed CF-MGM for the achievable rate and increase of users in a group outperforming the existing CSIT-based methods.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Velocity Estimation and Predictive Beamforming with Modular Linear Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity estimation is a cornerstone of recently introduced near-field predictive beamforming. This paper derives the closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint velocity estimation using a modular linear array (MLA) within a predictive-beamforming framework. The analysis shows that increasing inter-module separation enlarges the effective aperture and reduces the transverse-velocity CRB, whereas the radial-velocity CRB is largely insensitive to separation. We further obtain a simple closed-form relation linking the achievable antenna savings to the inter-module separation while preserving the same transverse accuracy of a uniform linear array (ULA). We further investigate how velocity mismatch affects array gain and show that transverse-velocity errors cause more severe performance degradation than radial-velocity errors. Simulations show that predictive beamforming with MLAs maintains high localization accuracy for target tracking.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted Downlink Satellite Covert Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to assist covert communication between a low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite and a ground user under the surveillance of a passive warden. The UAV simultaneously serves its own ground network and acts as a friendly jammer to enhance the covertness of satellite transmissions. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the warden's average minimum detection error probability which is then used to define the covert constraint. Building on this, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the UAV's 3D placement, its power allocation, and the satellite's transmit power to maximize the system's covert rate. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, and further develop a Dinkelbach's algorithm for a special case. Numerical results validate the tightness of the derived bound and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in configuring optimal system parameters.</description>

      <title>Distributed MIMO Positioning: Fundamental Limit Analysis and User Tracking Framework Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the 3D positioning capabilities of users in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy. In addition, the PEB-aware AP management strategy is shown to maintain robust tracking performance while significantly reducing the number of concurrently active APs, thus lowering the overall system overhead.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SaPINNs) for Input-State-Parameter Estimation in Dynamic Systems Subjected to Natural Hazards-Induced Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System identification under unknown external excitation is an inherently ill-posed problem, typically requiring additional knowledge or simplifying assumptions to enable reliable state and parameter estimation. The difficulty of the problem is further amplified in structural systems subjected to natural hazards such as earthquakes or windstorms, where responses are often highly transient, nonlinear, and spatially distributed. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectrum and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SaPINNs) for efficient input--state--parameter estimation in systems under complex excitations characteristic of natural hazards. The proposed model enhances the neural network with governing physics of the system dynamics and incorporates spectral information of natural hazards by using empirically derived spectra as priors on the unknown excitations. This integration improves inference of unmeasured inputs, system states, and parameters without imposing restrictive assumptions on their dynamics. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated through comparative studies on both linear and nonlinear systems under various types of excitation, including the El Centro earthquake, where the seismic spectrum is assumed to be not precisely known. To account for predictive uncertainty, the proposed architecture is embedded within a Deep Ensemble (DEns) networks architecture, providing distributions over possible solutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional PINNs, as the incorporation of spectral information introduces an inductive bias that guides the network more effectively through the solution space and enhances its ability to recover physically consistent state and parameter estimates with realistic uncertainty levels.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Near-Field Radio Map Recovery via RBF-Assisted Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel structure-aware matrix completion framework assisted by radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for near-field radio map construction in extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Unlike the far-field scenario, near-field wavefronts exhibit strong dependencies on both angle and distance due to spherical wave propagation, leading to complicated variations in received signal strength (RSS). To effectively capture the intricate spatial variations structure inherent in near-field environments, a regularized RBF interpolation method is developed to enhance radio map reconstruction accuracy. Leveraging theoretical insights from interpolation error analysis of RBF, an inverse {\mu}-law-inspired nonuniform sampling strategy is introduced to allocate measurements adaptively, emphasizing regions with rapid RSS variations near the transmitter. To further exploit the global low-rank structure in the near-field radio map, we integrate RBF interpolation with nuclear norm minimization (NNM)-based matrix completion. A robust Huberized leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme is then proposed for adaptive selection of the tolerance parameter, facilitating optimal fusion between RBF interpolation and matrix completion. The integration of local variation structure modeling via RBF interpolation and global low-rank structure exploitation via matrix completion yields a structure-aware framework that substantially improves the accuracy of near-field radio map reconstruction. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 10% improvement in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to standard interpolation and matrix completion methods under varying sampling densities and shadowing conditions.</description>

      <title>Learning Performance Optimization for Edge AI System with Time and Energy Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge AI, which brings artificial intelligence to the edge of the network for real-time processing and decision-making, has emerged as a transformative technology across various applications. However, the deployment of Edge AI systems faces significant challenges due to high energy consumption and extended operation time.
  In this paper, we consider an Edge AI system which integrates the data acquisition, computation and communication processes, and focus on improving learning performance of this system. We model the time and energy consumption of different processes and perform a rigorous convergence analysis to quantify the impact of key system parameters, such as the amount of collected data and the number of training rounds, on the learning performance. Based on this analysis, we formulate a system-wide optimization problem that seeks to maximize learning performance under given time and energy constraints. We explore both homogeneous and heterogeneous device scenarios, developing low-complexity algorithms based on one-dimensional search and alternating optimization to jointly optimize data collection time and training rounds. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our convergence analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, providing valuable insights into designing energy-efficient Edge AI systems under real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Joint Access Point Selection and Beamforming Design for Bistatic Backscatter Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future Internet-of-Things networks are envisioned to use small and cheap sensor nodes with extremely low power consumption to avoid the extensive use of batteries. To provide connectivity to a massive number of these nodes, backscatter communication (BC) is emerging as an energy- and cost-efficient technology exploiting the reflection of radio frequency signals. However, challenges such as round-trip path loss and direct link interference (DLI) between the carrier emitter and the reader limit its performance. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a joint access point role selection and a novel beamforming technique for bistatic BC in a distributed multiple-input multiple- output setup. The proposed approach boosts the received backscattered energy while effectively mitigating DLI, thereby reducing the error probability. We also propose a channel estimation method tailored to operate under DLI conditions and propose a mismatch detector using estimated channel coefficients. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability of error for the detectors and model the quantization noise caused by DLI. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the proposed method with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) effectively mitigates DLI, reduces the quantization noise, and enhances backscattered signal energy, achieving performance comparable to the benchmark scenario with 8-bit ADCs.</description>

      <title>Radio-Coverage-Aware Path Planning for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fleets of autonomous vehicles (AV) often are at the core of intelligent transportation scenarios for smart cities, and may require a wireless Internet connection to offload computer vision tasks to data centers located either in the edge or the cloud section of the network. Cooperation among AVs is successful when the environment is unknown, or changes dynamically, so as to improve coverage and trip time, and minimize the traveled distance. The AVs, while mapping the environment with range-based sensors, move across the wireless coverage areas, with consequences on the achieved access bit rate, latency, and handover rate. In this paper, we propose to modify the cost of path planning algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, so that not only the traveled distance is considered in the best path solution, but also the radio coverage experience. To this aim, several radio-related cost-weighting functions are introduced and tested, to assess the performance of the proposed techniques with extensive simulations. The proposed mapping algorithm can achieve a mapping error probability below 2%, while the proposed path-planning algorithms extend the experienced radio coverage of the AVs, with limited distance increase with respect to shortest-path existing methods, such as conventional Dijkstra and A* algorithms.</description>

      <title>MARBLE-Net: Learning to Localize in Multipath Environment with Adaptive Rainbow Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems demand precise and efficient target localization, a task challenged by rich multipath propagation in complex wireless environments. This paper introduces MARBLE-Net (Multipath-Aware Rainbow Beam Learning Network), a deep learning framework that jointly optimizes the analog beamforming parameters of a frequency-dependent rainbow beam and a neural localization network for high-accuracy position estimation. By treating the phase-shifter (PS) and true-time-delay (TTD) parameters as learnable weights, the system adaptively refines its sensing beam to exploit environment-specific multipath characteristics. A structured multi-stage training strategy is proposed to ensure stable convergence and effective end-to-end optimization. Simulation results show that MARBLE-Net outperforms both a fixed-beam deep learning baseline (RaiNet) and a traditional k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, reducing localization error by more than 50\% in a multipath-rich scene. Moreover, the results reveal a nuanced interaction with multipath propagation: while confined uni-directional multipath degrades accuracy, structured and directional multipath can be effectively exploited to achieve performance surpassing even line-of-sight (LoS) conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of wireless devices necessitates more robust and reliable emitter detection and identification for critical tasks such as spectrum management and network security. Existing studies exploring methods for unknown emitters identification, however, are typically hindered by their dependence on labeled or proprietary datasets, unrealistic assumptions (e.g. all samples with identical transmitted messages), or deficiency of systematic evaluations across different architectures and design dimensions. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of unknown emitter detection systems across key aspects of the design space, focusing on data modality, learning approaches, and feature learn- ing modules. We demonstrate that prior self-supervised, zero-shot emitter detection approaches commonly use datasets with identical transmitted messages. To address this limitation, we propose a 2D- Constellation data modality for scenarios with varying messages, achieving up to a 40\% performance improvement in ROC-AUC, NMI, and F1 metrics compared to conventional raw I/Q data. Furthermore, we introduce interpretable Kolmogorov--Arnold Net- works (KANs) to enhance model transparency, and a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based initialization procedure for feature learning modules operating on sparse 2D-Constellation data, which improves the performance of Deep Clustering approaches by up to 40\% across the same metrics comparing to the modules without SVD initialization. We evaluate all data modalities and learning modules across three learning approaches: Deep Clustering, Auto Encoder and Contrastive Learning.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Design for UAV-Assisted Logistics Collection in Low-Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly emerging as a key driver of innovation, encompassing economic activities taking place in airspace below 500 meters. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide valuable tools for logistics collection within LAE systems, offering the ability to navigate through complex environments, avoid obstacles, and improve operational efficiency. However, logistics collection tasks involve UAVs flying through complex three-dimensional (3D) environments while avoiding obstacles, where traditional UAV trajectory design methods,typically developed under free-space conditions without explicitly accounting for obstacles, are not applicable. This paper presents, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) methods to minimize the total collection time. Specifically, the LKH algorithm determines the optimal order of item collection, while the DDPG algorithm designs the flight trajectory between collection points. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed LKH-DDPG algorithm significantly reduces collection time by approximately 49 percent compared to baseline approaches, thereby highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing UAV trajectories and enhancing operational efficiency for logistics collection tasks in the LAE paradigm.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity ADMM-Based Multicast Beamforming in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient delivery of common content to multiple user equipments (UEs) has motivated significant research in physical-layer multicasting. By exploiting the beamforming capabilities of massive MIMO, multicasting provides a spectrum-efficient solution that avoids unnecessary intra-group interference. A key challenge, however, is solving the max-min fair (MMF) and quality-of-service (QoS) multicast beamforming optimization problems, which are NP-hard due to the non-convex structure and the requirement for rank-1 solutions. Traditional approaches based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) followed by randomization exhibit poor scalability with system size, while state-of-the-art successive convex approximation (SCA) methods only guarantee convergence to stationary points. In this paper, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework for MMF and QoS multicast beamforming in cell-free massive MIMO networks. The algorithm leverages SDR but incorporates a novel iterative elimination strategy within the ADMM updates to efficiently obtain near-global optimal rank-1 beamforming solutions with reduced computational complexity compared to standard SDP solvers and randomization methods. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ADMM-based procedure not only achieves superior spectral efficiency but also scales favorably with the number of antennas and UEs compared to state-of-the-art SCA-based algorithms, making it a practical tool for next-generation multicast systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced GCD through ORBGRAND-AI: Exploiting Partial and Total Correlation in Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been significant advances in recent years in the development of forward error correction decoders that can decode codes of any structure, including practical realizations in synthesized circuits and taped out chips. While essentially all soft-decision decoders assume that bits have been impacted independently on the channel, for one of these new approaches it has been established that channel dependencies can be exploited to achieve superior decoding accuracy, resulting in Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding Approximate Independence (ORBGRAND-AI). Building on that capability, here we consider the integration of ORBGRAND-AI as a pattern generator for Guessing Codeword Decoding (GCD). We first establish that a direct approach delivers mildly degraded block error rate (BLER) but with reduced number of queried patterns when compared to ORBGRAND-AI. We then show that with a more nuanced approach it is possible to leverage total correlation to deliver an additional BLER improvement of around 0.75 dB while retaining reduced query numbers.</description>

Abstract: Earth's gravity has fundamentally shaped human development by guiding the brain's integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs into an internal model of gravity: a dynamic neural representation enabling prediction and interpretation of gravitational forces. This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models. This combined framework integrates quantitative physiological modeling with generative cognitive simulation, offering a novel approach to understanding and predicting human performance in altered gravity</description>

      <title>QiVC-Net: Quantum-Inspired Variational Convolutional Network, with Application to Biosignal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the quantum-inspired variational convolution (QiVC) framework, a novel learning paradigm that integrates principles of probabilistic inference, variational optimization, and quantum-inspired transformations within convolutional architectures. The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively. These findings highlight the versatility of the QiVC framework and its promise for advancing uncertainty-aware modeling in real-world biomedical signal analysis. The implementation of the QiVConv layer is openly available in GitHub.</description>

      <title>Signal and Image Recovery with Scale and Signed Permutation Invariant Sparsity-Promoting Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse signal recovery has been a cornerstone of advancements in data processing and imaging. Recently, the squared ratio of $\ell_1$ to $\ell_2$ norms, $(\ell_1/\ell_2)^2$, has been introduced as a sparsity-prompting function, showing superior performance compared to traditional $\ell_1$ minimization, particularly in challenging scenarios with high coherence and dynamic range. This paper explores the integration of the proximity operator of $(\ell_1/\ell_2)^2$ and $\ell_1/\ell_2$ into efficient optimization frameworks, including the Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We rigorously analyze the convergence properties of these algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness in compressed sensing and image restoration applications. Numerical experiments highlight the advantages of our proposed methods in terms of recovery accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly under noise and high-coherence conditions.</description>

      <title>Catching Contamination Before Generation: Spectral Kill Switches for Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic language models compose multi step reasoning chains, yet intermediate steps can be corrupted by inconsistent context, retrieval errors, or adversarial inputs, which makes post hoc evaluation too late because errors propagate before detection. We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations. We demonstrate integration into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and discuss deployment as an inline safety monitor. The approach detects contamination while the model is still processing the text, before errors commit to the reasoning chain.</description>

      <title>Precision-Scalable Microscaling Datapaths with Optimized Reduction Tree for Efficient NPU Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging continual learning applications necessitate next-generation neural processing unit (NPU) platforms to support both training and inference operations. The promising Microscaling (MX) standard enables narrow bit-widths for inference and large dynamic ranges for training. However, existing MX multiply-accumulate (MAC) designs face a critical trade-off: integer accumulation requires expensive conversions from narrow floating-point products, while FP32 accumulation suffers from quantization losses and costly normalization. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid precision-scalable reduction tree for MX MACs that combines the benefits of both approaches, enabling efficient mixed-precision accumulation with controlled accuracy relaxation. Moreover, we integrate an 8x8 array of these MACs into the state-of-the-art (SotA) NPU integration platform, SNAX, to provide efficient control and data transfer to our optimized precision-scalable MX datapath. We evaluate our design both on MAC and system level and compare it to the SotA. Our integrated system achieves an energy efficiency of 657, 1438-1675, and 4065 GOPS/W, respectively, for MXINT8, MXFP8/6, and MXFP4, with a throughput of 64, 256, and 512 GOPS.</description>

      <title>Sensor Importance towards Observability Degree via Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor selection is an often under-appreciated aspect of state estimator or Kalman filter design. The basic minimum requirement for the choice of a sensor set while designing Kalman filters is that all states are observable. In addition, the sensors should be chosen with a view towards estimating the states with a desired accuracy. Often observability is treated as true/false check during filter design. Beyond observability -- the observability degree -- which measures \emph{how observable} the states are, has been used as the metric of choice to for sensor selection or placement applications. The higher the degree of observability, the better the possibility of designing Kalman filters that achieve the desired state estimation accuracy and consistency requirements. When a wide variety of sensors are available, sometimes with cost and physical constraints involved, sensor selection plays a crucial role in filter design. In such situations it is important to know the expected contribution of each sensor towards observability degree. Shapley values, developed in cooperative game theory for fair allocation of the payout of a multi-player game to individual players, are widely used in machine learning to assess feature importance. This paper shows that Shapley values can indeed be leveraged to quantify the expected marginal contribution of each sensor in any given sensor set towards the observability degree. This quantification of the fair contribution of each sensor towards the observability degree can be leveraged by filter designers for sensor selection, placement and filter (state estimator) design.</description>

      <title>Turbo-DDCM: Fast and Flexible Zero-Shot Diffusion-Based Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While zero-shot diffusion-based compression methods have seen significant progress in recent years, they remain notoriously slow and computationally demanding. This paper presents an efficient zero-shot diffusion-based compression method that runs substantially faster than existing methods, while maintaining performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art techniques. Our method builds upon the recently proposed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCMs) compression scheme. Specifically, DDCM compresses an image by sequentially choosing the diffusion noise vectors from reproducible random codebooks, guiding the denoiser's output to reconstruct the target image. We modify this framework with Turbo-DDCM, which efficiently combines a large number of noise vectors at each denoising step, thereby significantly reducing the number of required denoising operations. This modification is also coupled with an improved encoding protocol. Furthermore, we introduce two flexible variants of Turbo-DDCM, a priority-aware variant that prioritizes user-specified regions and a distortion-controlled variant that compresses an image based on a target PSNR rather than a target BPP. Comprehensive experiments position Turbo-DDCM as a compelling, practical, and flexible image compression scheme.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Varying Graph Signals via Koopman</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of real-world data, such as sea measurements, e.g., temperatures collected by distributed sensors and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectories, can be naturally represented as graphs, often exhibiting non-Euclidean structures. These graph representations may evolve over time, forming time-varying graphs. Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data. Specifically, we assume the existence of a hidden non-linear dynamical system, where the state vector corresponds to the graph embedding of the time-varying graph signals. To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space. In this latent space, the KAE is applied to learn the underlying non-linear dynamics governing the temporal evolution of graph features, enabling both prediction and reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Differential Space-Time Block Coding for Phase-Unsynchronized Cell-Free MIMO Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the downlink of a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system, spectral efficiency gains critically rely on joint coherent transmission, as all access points (APs) must align their transmitted signals in phase at the user equipment (UE). Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems.</description>

      <title>Wireless Sensor Networks Nodes Clustering and Optimization Based on Fuzzy C-Means and Water Strider Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face critical challenges in energy management and network lifetime optimization due to limited battery resources and communication overhead. This study introduces a novel hybrid clustering protocol that integrates the Water Strider Algorithm (WSA) with Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to achieve superior energy efficiency and network longevity. The proposed WSA-FCM method employs WSA for global optimization of cluster- head positions and FCM for refined node membership assignment with fuzzy boundaries. Through extensive experimentation across networks of 200-800 nodes with 10 independent simulation runs, the method demonstrates significant improvements: First Node Death (FND) delayed by 16.1% ($678\pm12$ vs $584\pm18$ rounds), Last Node Death (LND) extended by 11.9% ($1,262\pm8$ vs $1,128\pm11$ rounds), and 37.4% higher residual energy retention ($5.47\pm0.09$ vs $3.98\pm0.11$ J) compared to state-of-the-art hybrid methods. Intra-cluster distances are reduced by 19.4% with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.001). Theoretical analysis proves convergence guarantees and complexity bounds of $O(n\times c\times T)$, while empirical scalability analysis demonstrates near-linear scaling behaviour. The method outperforms recent hybrid approaches including MOALO-FCM, MSSO-MST, Fuzzy+HHO, and GWO-FCM across all performance metrics with rigorous statistical validation.</description>

      <title>On the Redundant Distributed Observability of Mixed Traffic Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of distributed state estimation of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is investigated in mixed traffic transportation systems. Toward this, a distributed observable state-space model is derived, which paves the way for estimation and observability analysis of HDVs in mixed traffic scenarios. In this direction, first, we obtain the condition on the network topology to satisfy the distributed observability, i.e., the condition such that each HDV state is observable to every CAV via information-exchange over the network. It is shown that strong connectivity of the network, along with the proper design of the observer gain, is sufficient for this. A distributed observer is then designed by locally sharing estimates/observations of each CAV with its neighborhood. Second, in case there exist faulty sensors or unreliable observation data, we derive the condition for redundant distributed observability as a $q$-node/link-connected network design. This redundancy is achieved by extra information-sharing over the network and implies that a certain number of faulty sensors and unreliable links can be isolated/removed without losing the observability. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of Reflective Near-Field Beamfocusing using a b-bit RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first experimental validation of reflective near-field beamfocusing using a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). While beamfocusing has been theoretically established as a key feature of large-aperture RISs, its practical realization has remained unexplored. We derive new analytical expressions for the array gain achieved with a $b$-bit RIS in near-field line-of-sight scenarios, characterizing both the finite depth and angular width of the focal region. The theoretical results are validated through a series of measurements in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz using a one-bit 1024-element RIS. The experiments confirm that near-field beamfocusing can be dynamically achieved and accurately predicted by the proposed analytical model, despite the presence of hardware imperfections and multipath propagation. These findings demonstrate that near-field beamfocusing is a robust and practically viable feature of RIS-assisted wireless communications.</description>

      <title>A Provably-Correct and Robust Convex Model for Smooth Separable NMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique for nonnegative data, with applications such as hyperspectral unmixing and topic modeling. NMF is a difficult problem in general (NP-hard), and its solutions are typically not unique. To address these two issues, additional constraints or assumptions are often used. In particular, separability assumes that the basis vectors in the NMF are equal to some columns of the input matrix. In that case, the problem is referred to as separable NMF (SNMF) and can be solved in polynomial-time with robustness guarantees, while identifying a unique solution. However, in real-world scenarios, due to noise or variability, multiple data points may lie near the basis vectors, which SNMF does not leverage. In this work, we rely on the smooth separability assumption, which assumes that each basis vector is close to multiple data points. We explore the properties of the corresponding problem, referred to as smooth SNMF (SSNMF), and examine how it relates to SNMF and orthogonal NMF. We then propose a convex model for SSNMF and show that it provably recovers the sought-after factors, even in the presence of noise. We finally adapt an existing fast gradient method to solve this convex model for SSNMF, and show that it compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and hyperspectral datasets.</description>

      <title>Parameterized TDOA: TDOA estimation for mobile target localization in a time-division broadcast positioning system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a time-division broadcast positioning system (TDBPS), localizing mobile targets using classical time difference of arrival (TDOA) methods poses significant challenges. Concurrent TDOA measurements are infeasible because targets receive signals from different anchors and extract their transmission times at different reception times, as well as at varying positions. Traditional TDOA estimation schemes implicitly assume that the target remains stationary during the measurement period, which is impractical for mobile targets exhibiting high dynamics. Existing methods for mobile target localization are mostly specialized and rely on motion modeling and do not rely on the concurrent TDOA measurements. This issue limits their direct use of the well-established classical TDOA-based localization methods and complicating the entire localization process. In this paper, to obtain concurrent TDOA estimates at any instant out of the sequential measurements for direct use of existing TDOA-based localization methods, we propose a novel TDOA estimation method, termed parameterized TDOA (P-TDOA). By approximating the time-varying TDOA as a polynomial function over a short period, we transform the TDOA estimation problem into a model parameter estimation problem and derive the desired TDOA estimates thereafter. Theoretical analysis shows that, under certain conditions, the proposed P-TDOA method closely approaches the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for TDOA estimation in concurrent measurement scenarios, despite measurements being obtained sequentially. Extensive numerical simulations validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting substantial improvements over existing approaches across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency of Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the maximum achievable downlink spectral efficiency of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations. Spectral efficiency is defined here as the total network sum rate per unit bandwidth per unit area of Earth's surface. To estimate an upper bound on spectral efficiency, the problem is reduced to a single-channel network model, where all satellites and ground terminals operate over a common narrowband frequency channel. Within this model a regular configuration is proposed and evaluated, with satellites and terminals arranged in hexagonal lattices. Numerical results validate that this configuration provides a robust upper bound for spectral efficiency in more complex multi-channel LEO networks, especially when satellite-terminal associations are based on minimum distance. Further improvements are achieved by adjusting association rules to prevent neighboring satellites from simultaneously serving terminals in the same region, highlighting the critical role of interference-aware association strategies.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Filter Spectra in CNN for Explainable Sleep Stage Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in deep learning-based sleep stage classification, the clinical adoption of automatic classification models remains slow. One key challenge is the lack of explainability, as many models function as black boxes with millions of parameters. In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by introducing an explainability tool for spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, this tools retrieves the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compares it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We apply our tool on the EEGNet and MSA-CNN models using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. The tool reveals that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-derived spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at https://github.com/sgoerttler/MSA-CNN.</description>

      <title>A Fairness-Aware Strategy for B5G Physical-layer Security Leveraging Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06344v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and lead to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. When combined with Reinforcement Learning techniques, they have the potential to enhance both system behavior and physical-layer security hardening. In addition to security improvements, it is crucial to consider the concept of fair communication. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces must ensure that User Equipment units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other units being deprived of ser- vice due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining both an efficient and fair duplex Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Reinforcement Learning system for multiple legitimate User Equipment units without reducing the level of achieved physical-layer security hardening. In terms of contributions, we uncover a fairness imbalance of a previous physical-layer security hardening solution, validate our findings and report experimental work via simulation results. We also provide an alternative reward strategy to solve the uncovered problems and release both code and datasets to foster further research in the topics of this paper.</description>

      <title>General Signal Model and Capacity Limit for Rydberg Quantum Information System</title>

Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception. However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we present a general model to compute the dynamic signal response of Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver's dynamic responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an equivalent classical system. By applying quantum transconductance, we quantify the influence of in-band blackbody radiation (BBR) noise on the atomic receiver sensitivity. Extensive simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum transconductance.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Mode Decomposition: A Morphological Segmentation Framework for Signal Analysis and Its Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While time-frequency analysis provides rich representations of multicomponent signals, current signal decomposition methods fail to fully exploit the spatial structure of time-frequency distributions, where components often manifest as morphologically distinct regions. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition (TFMD), a novel framework that reframes signal decomposition as a morphological segmentation task in the time-frequency domain. TFMD constructs a unique TF mask for each component by first identifying high-energy core regions with unsupervised k-means clustering, segmenting them with connected-component labeling and a size filter, and then expanding each core using an iterative competitive dilation algorithm to form the complete TF mask, enabling precise isolation and reconstruction of individual modes. Validation on a comprehensive suite of synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately identifies the number of components and reconstructs them with high fidelity, particularly excelling in high-noise conditions. A comparative analysis confirms that TFMD offers robust and competitive performance across diverse signal types, outperforming several benchmark methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Its practical utility is demonstrated by successfully decomposing a non-stationary wind turbine vibration signal, where a two-stage $\mathrm{TFMD}^2$ approach effectively isolates both the fundamental rotational frequency components and their weaker harmonic components across varying operational speeds. TFMD thus provides an accurate, adaptive, and efficient morphological segmentation framework for multicomponent signal analysis with broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Automated Detection of Circadian-Dependent Epileptic Biomarkers for Seizure Localization: A Machine Learning and Signal Processing Framework</title>

Abstract: Epileptic biomarkers play a crucial role in identifying the origin of seizures, an essential aspect of pre-surgical planning for epilepsy treatment. These biomarkers can vary significantly over time. By studying these temporal fluctuations, we can enhance their effectiveness in guiding surgical planning. This research focuses on examining how circadian rhythms influence epilepsy biomarkers and aims to determine the optimal times for their analysis. To investigate the relationship between epilepsy biomarkers and circadian rhythm, the sleep/wake states first need to be classified. After the biomarkers are identified, they are compared across these states. A retrospective analysis was conducted on intracranial electroencephalography data from patients with focal epilepsy. The biomarkers-spikes, spike sequences, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and pathological HFOs-were identified through automatic detection. The alpha/delta ratio was also calculated to distinguish between asleep and awake stages. Data from 9 patients were analyzed, and the classification of sleep and wake states was achieved with an area under the curve of 84%. All biomarker rates were higher during the sleep stage compared to the wake stage. Pathological HFOs and the sequence of spikes proved to be more precise indicators regarding distance to seizure onset than spikes or HFOs. Unlike previous studies that relied predominantly on long-term spike biomarker analysis, this study is the first to utilize a comprehensive set of biomarkers, including HFOs, spike sequences, and pathological HFOs, to enhance seizure onset zone prediction. The rates of epilepsy biomarkers during sleep vary considerably from those seen while awake, making sleep data analysis more effective in accurately predicting the seizure onset zone.</description>

      <title>Estimation of aboveground biomass in a tropical dry forest: An intercomparison of airborne, unmanned, and space laser scanning</title>

Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev\.minimum, Elev\.L3, lev\.MAD\.mode, Elev\.mode, Elev\.MAD\.median, and Elev\.skewness, are important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD, while Leaf Area Index, canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha. The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in estimating total biomass per plot.</description>

      <title>Stacked Flexible Intelligent Metasurface Design for Multi-User Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently emerged as an effective solution for next-generation wireless networks. A SIM comprises multiple metasurface layers that enable signal processing directly in the wave domain. Moreover, recent advances in flexible metamaterials have highlighted the potential of flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs), which can be physically morphed to enhance communication performance. In this paper, we propose a stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM)-based communication system for the first time, where each metasurface layer is deformable to improve the system's performance. We first present the system model, including the transmit and receive signal models as well as the channel model, and then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the system sum rate under constraints on the transmit power budget, morphing distance, and the unit-modulus condition of the meta-atom responses. To solve this problem, we develop an alternating optimization framework based on the gradient projection method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SFIM-based system achieves significant performance gains compared to its rigid SIM counterpart.</description>

      <title>RCMCL: A Unified Contrastive Learning Framework for Robust Multi-Modal (RGB-D, Skeleton, Point Cloud) Action Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) with multi-modal inputs (RGB-D, skeleton, point cloud) can achieve high accuracy but typically relies on large labeled datasets and degrades sharply when sensors fail or are noisy. We present Robust Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning (RCMCL), a self-supervised framework that learns modality-invariant representations and remains reliable under modality dropout and corruption. RCMCL jointly optimizes (i) a cross-modal contrastive objective that aligns heterogeneous streams, (ii) an intra-modal self-distillation objective that improves view-invariance and reduces redundancy, and (iii) a degradation simulation objective that explicitly trains models to recover from masked or corrupted inputs. At inference, an Adaptive Modality Gating (AMG) network assigns data-driven reliability weights to each modality for robust fusion. On NTU RGB+D 120 (CS/CV) and UWA3D-II, RCMCL attains state-of-the-art accuracy in standard settings and exhibits markedly better robustness: under severe dual-modality dropout it shows only an 11.5% degradation, significantly outperforming strong supervised fusion baselines. These results indicate that self-supervised cross-modal alignment, coupled with explicit degradation modeling and adaptive fusion, is key to deployable multi-modal HAR.</description>

      <title>A CNN-LSTM Quantifier for Single Access Point CSI Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.06394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a combined network structure between convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) quantifier for WiFi fingerprinting indoor localization. In contrast to conventional methods that utilize only spatial data with classification models, our CNN-LSTM network extracts both space and time features of the received channel state information (CSI) from a single router. Furthermore, the proposed network builds a quantification model rather than a limited classification model as in most of the literature work, which enables the estimation of testing points that are not identical to the reference points. We analyze the instability of CSI and demonstrate a mitigation solution using a comprehensive filter and normalization scheme. The localization accuracy is investigated through extensive on-site experiments with several mobile devices including mobile phone (Nexus 5) and laptop (Intel 5300 NIC) on hundreds of testing locations. Using only a single WiFi router, our structure achieves an average localization error of 2.5~m with $\mathrm{80\%}$ of the errors under 4~m, which outperforms the other reported algorithms by approximately $\mathrm{50\%}$ under the same test environment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) is expected to be intelligent and scalable. In this paper, we study Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled next-generation MIMO networks. Firstly, we provide an overview of the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the next-generation MIMO. Then, we propose the concept of the generative AI agent, which is capable of generating tailored and specialized contents with the aid of LLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Next, we comprehensively discuss the features and advantages of the generative AI agent framework. More importantly, to tackle existing challenges of next-generation MIMO, we discuss generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO networks from the perspective of performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we present two compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the generative AI agent for performance analysis in complex configuration scenarios. These examples highlight how the integration of generative AI agents can significantly enhance the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems. Finally, we discuss important potential research future directions.</description>

      <title>Topological Antenna: A Non-Classical Beam-Steering Micro-Antenna Based on Spin Injection from a Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antennas are the quintessential means to communicate information wirelessly over long distances via electromagnetic waves. Traditional antennas have two shortcomings that have prevented miniaturization: (1) their radiation efficiencies plummet and (2) they radiate isotropically when miniaturized to small fractions of the radiated wavelength. Here, we report a new genre of non-classical antennas that overcome these limitations by employing non-traditional principles and harnessing topological insulators. An alternating charge current of frequency 1-10 GHz injected into a thin film of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) injects a spin current of alternating spin polarization into a periodic array of cobalt nanomagnets deposited on the surface of the 3D-TI. This generates spin waves in the nanomagnets, which radiate electromagnetic waves in space, thereby implementing an antenna. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave is the same as that of the current. The antenna dimension is only 0.6-1.8% of the free space wavelength and yet it radiates with an efficiency several orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical limit for conventional antennas. Furthermore, it radiates anisotropically (despite being a "point source") and one can change the anisotropic radiation pattern by changing the direction of the injected alternating charge current, which changes the spin wave patterns within the nanomagnets because of spin-momentum locking in the 3D-TI. This enables beam steering without the use of a phased array. We have overcome several limitations of classical antennas by harnessing the quantum mechanical attributes of a quantum material, namely a 3D-TI.</description>

      <title>Low-altitude UAV Friendly-Jamming for Satellite-Maritime Communications via Generative AI-enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can be used to assist maritime wireless communications for wide-area data transmission. However, the extensive coverage of LEO satellites, combined with the openness of channels, can cause the communication process to suffer from security risks. This paper presents a LEO satellite-maritime communication system assisted by low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) friendly-jamming to ensure data security at the physical layer. Since such a system requires balancing the conflicting performance metrics of secrecy rate and energy consumption of the UAV to meet evolving scenario demands, we formulate a secure satellite-maritime communication multi-objective optimization problem (SSMCMOP). In order to solve the dynamic and long-term optimization problem, we reformulate it into a Markov decision process. We then propose a transformer-enhanced soft actor-critic (TransSAC) algorithm, which is a generative artificial intelligence-enabled deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the reformulated problem, thus capturing strong temporal correlations and diversely exploring weights. Simulation results demonstrate that the TransSAC algorithm outperforms comparative approaches and algorithms, maximizing the secrecy rate while effectively minimizing the energy consumption of the UAV. Moreover, the results identify more suitable constraints for the system.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Indoor LoRaWAN Ranging Using Path Loss Model Inversion and Adaptive RSSI Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving sub-10 m indoor ranging with LoRaWAN is difficult because multipath, human blockage, and micro-climate dynamics induce non-stationary attenuation in received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. We present a lightweight, interpretable pipeline that couples an environment-aware multi-wall path loss model with a forward-only, innovation-driven Kalman prefilter for RSSI. The model augments distance and wall terms with frequency, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and co-located environmental covariates (temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure), and is inverted deterministically for distance estimation. On a one-year single-gateway office dataset comprising over 2 million uplinks, the approach attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.74 m and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.76 m in distance estimation, improving over a COST-231 multi-wall baseline (12.07 m MAE) and its environment-augmented variant (7.76 m MAE. Filtering reduces RSSI volatility from 10.33 to 5.43 dB and halves path loss error to 5.35 dB while raising R-squared from 0.82 to 0.89. The result is a single-anchor LoRaWAN ranging method with constant per-packet cost that is accurate, robust, and interpretable, providing a strong building block for multi-gateway localization.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Dynamic Fading Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic causal discovery in wireless networks is essential due to evolving interference, fading, and mobility, which complicate traditional static causal models. This paper addresses causal inference challenges in dynamic fading wireless environments by proposing a sequential regression-based algorithm with a novel application of the NOTEARS acyclicity constraint, enabling efficient online updates. We derive theoretical lower and upper bounds on the detection delay required to identify structural changes, explicitly quantifying their dependence on network size, noise variance, and fading severity. Monte Carlo simulations validate these theoretical results, demonstrating linear increases in detection delay with network size, quadratic growth with noise variance, and inverse-square dependence on the magnitude of structural changes. Our findings provide rigorous theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing robust online causal inference mechanisms to maintain network reliability under nonstationary wireless conditions.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distribution Release of Gaussian Mixture Models via KL-Divergence Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are widely used statistical models for representing multi-modal data distributions, with numerous applications in data mining, pattern recognition, data simulation, and machine learning. However, recent research has shown that releasing GMM parameters poses significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive information about the underlying data. In this paper, we address the challenge of releasing GMM parameters while ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Specifically, we focus on the privacy protection of mixture weights, component means, and covariance matrices. We propose to use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a utility metric to assess the accuracy of the released GMM, as it captures the joint impact of noise perturbation on all the model parameters. To achieve privacy, we introduce a DP mechanism that adds carefully calibrated random perturbations to the GMM parameters. Through theoretical analysis, we quantify the effects of privacy budget allocation and perturbation statistics on the DP guarantee, and derive a tractable expression for evaluating KL divergence. We formulate and solve an optimization problem to minimize the KL divergence between the released and original models, subject to a given $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high utility.</description>

      <title>Flexible MIMO for Future Wireless Communications: Which Flexibilities are Possible?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), static array configurations struggle in dynamic environments, and further antenna scaling is bounded by cost, energy, and footprint. Emerging approaches, which can enable next-generation wireless communication networks with modest spectrum availability by leveraging flexibility and adaptability rather than sheer array growth, are therefore needed. In this paper, we present a taxonomy framework, referred to as flexible MIMO technology, that systematically categorizes a wide range of evolving MIMO technologies. The focus is on MIMO technologies with flexible physical configurations and integrated applications. We categorize twelve representative flexible MIMO technologies into three major classifications: flexible deployment characteristics-based, flexible geometry characteristics-based, and flexible real-time modifications-based. We then comprehensively overview their fundamental characteristics, potential, and challenges. In addition, we highlight three vital enablers for flexible MIMO technology, including efficient channel state information acquisition schemes, low-complexity beamforming design, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled optimization, and discuss eight representative sub-techniques. Finally, two brief case studies -- pre-optimized irregular array for high-speed railway network and cell-free movable antenna -- are presented, showing how flexible MIMO can open new design possibilities and inspire future research directions for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Convergence Rates for Plug-and-Play Methods With MMSE Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive (to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer. We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.</description>
