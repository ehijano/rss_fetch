      <title>Backward-forward characterization of attainable set for conservation laws with spatially discontinuous flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a scalar conservation law with a spatially discontinuous flux at a single point x=0, and assume that the flux is uniformly convex when x\neq 0. Given an interface connection (A,B), we define a backward solution operator consistent with the concept of AB-entropy solution [4,13,16]. We then analyze the family A^{[AB]}(T) of profiles that can be attained at time T&gt;0 by AB-entropy solutions with L^\infty-initial data. We provide a characterization of A^{[AB]}(T) as fixed points of the backward-forward solution operator. As an intermediate step we establish a full characterization of A^{[AB]}(T) in terms of unilateral constraints and Ole\v{\i}nik-type estimates, valid for all connections. Building on such a characterization we derive uniform BV bounds on the flux of AB-entropy solutions, which in turn yield the L^1_{loc}-Lipschitz continuity in time of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Singular solutions of semilinear elliptic equations with exponential nonlinearities in 2-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing a new classification of the growth rate of exponential functions, singular solutions for semilinear elliptic equations in 2-dimensions with exponential nonlinearities are constructed. The strategy is to introduce a model nonlinearity which admits an explicit singular solution. Then, using a transformation as in [8], one obtains an approximate singular solution, and then one concludes by a suitable fixed point argument. Our method covers a wide class of nonlinearities in a unified way. As a special case, our result contains a pioneering contribution by Ibrahim--Kikuchi--Nakanishi--Wei [15] for the Moser--Trudinger type nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Stability of equilibria of the spatially inhomogeneous Vicsek-BGK equation across a bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vicsek-BGK equation is a kinetic model for alignment of particles moving with constant speed between stochastic reorientation events with sampling from a von Mises distribution. The spatially homogeneous model shows a steady state bifurcation with exchange of stability. The main result of this work is an extension of the bifurcation result to the spatially inhomogeneous problem under the additional assumption of a sufficiently large Knudsen number, which is shown to be necessary. A counterexample is derived in the form of an exponentially increasing travelling wave solution of the linearized equation, indicating a possible explanation of traveling bands, which have been observed in the literature in simulations with an individual based model. The mathematical core is the proof of linearized stability, which employs a new hypocoercivity approach based on Laplace-Fourier transformation. The bifurcation result includes global existence of smooth solutions for close-to-equilibrium initial data. For large data smooth solutions might blow up in finite time whereas weak solutions with bounded Boltzmann entropy are shown to exist globally.</description>

      <title>Mean First Passage Times for Transport Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many transport processes in ecology, physics and biochemistry can be described by the average time to first find a site or exit a region, starting from an initial position. Typical mathematical treatments are based on formulations that allow for various diffusive forms and geometries but where only initial and final positions are taken into account. Here, we develop a general theory for the mean first passage time (MFPT) for velocity jump processes. For random walkers, both position and velocity are tracked and the resulting Fokker-Planck equation takes the form of a kinetic transport equation. Starting from the forward and backward formulations we derive a general elliptic integro-PDE for the MFPT of a random walker starting at a given location with a given velocity. We focus on two scenarios that are relevant to biological modelling; the diffusive case and the anisotropic case. For the anisotropic case we also perform a parabolic scaling, leading to a well known anisotropic MFPT equation. To illustrate the results we consider a two-dimensional circular domain under radial symmetry, where the MFPT equations can be solved explicitly. Furthermore, we consider the MFPT of a random walker in an ecological habitat that is perturbed by linear features, such as</description>

      <title>Sharp regularity estimates for $0$-order $p$-Laplacian evolution problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regularity properties of solutions to nonlinear and nonlocal evolution problems driven by the so-called \emph{$0$-order fractional $p-$Laplacian} type operators: $$ \partial_t u(x,t)=\mathcal{J}_p u(x,t):=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} J(x-y)|u(y,t)-u(x,t)|^{p-2}(u(y,t)-u(x,t))\,dy\,, $$ where $n\ge 1$, $p&gt;1$, $J\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded nonnegative function with compact support, $J(0)&gt;0$ and normalized such that $\|J\|_{\mathrm{L}^1(\mathbb{R}^n)}=1$, but not necessarily smooth. We deal with Cauchy problems on the whole space, and with Dirichlet and Neumann problems on bounded domains. Beside complementing the existing results about existence and uniqueness theory, we focus on sharp regularity results in the whole range $p\in (1,\infty)$. When $p&gt;2$, we find an unexpected $\mathrm{L}^q-\mathrm{L}^\infty$ regularization: the surprise comes from the fact that this result is false in the linear case $p=2$.
  We show next that bounded solutions automatically gain higher time regularity, more precisely that $u(x,\cdot)\in C^p_t$. We finally show that solutions preserve the regularity of the initial datum up to certain order, that we conjecture to be optimal ($p$-derivatives in space). When $p&gt;1$ is integer we can reach $C^\infty$ regularity (gained in time, preserved in space) and even analyticity in time. The regularity estimates that we obtain are quantitative and constructive (all computable constants), and have a local character, allowing us to show further properties of the solutions: for instance, initial singularities do not move with time. We also study the asymptotic behavior for large times of solutions to Dirichlet and Neumann problems. Our results are new also in the linear case and are sharp when $p$ is integer. We expect them to be optimal for all $p&gt;1$, supporting this claim with some numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A uniqueness theory on determining the nonlinear energy potential in phase-field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-field system is a nonlinear model that has significant applications in material sciences. In this paper, we are concerned with the uniqueness of determining the nonlinear energy potential in a phase-field system consisted of Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations. This system finds widespread applications in the development of alloys engineered to withstand extreme temperatures and pressures. The goal is to reconstruct the nonlinear energy potential through the measurements of concentration fields. We establish the local well-posedness of the phase-field system based on the implicit function theorem in Banach spaces. Both of the uniqueness results for recovering time-independent and time-dependent energy potential functions are provided through the higher order linearization technique.</description>

      <title>Strong maximum principle for generalized solutions to equations of the Monge-Amp\`ere type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong maximum principle for generalized solutions of Monge-Amp\`ere type equations. We prove that the strong maximum principle holds at points where the function is strictly convex but not necessarily $C^{1,1}$ smooth, and show that it fails at non-strictly convex points. The results we obtain can be applied to various Minkowski type problems in convex geometry by the virtue of the Gauss image map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solitary water waves on the vorticity flow in a two-dimensional channel of finite depth. The main object of study is a branch of solitary waves starting from a laminar flow and then approaching an extreme wave. In \cite{Koz1b} it was proved that there always exists a bifurcation point on such branches and the first bifurcation occurs at a simple eigenvalue. Here we describe the structure of global bifurcating branches starting from this bifurcation point.</description>

      <title>Landau-de Gennes model with sextic potentials: asymptotic behavior of minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of Landau-de Gennes energy functionals with a sextic bulk energy density in a three-dimensional domain. We examine the asymptotic behavior of uniformly bounded minimizers in two distinct scenarios: one where their energy remains uniformly bounded, and another where it logarithmically diverges as a function of the elastic constant. In the first case, we show that up to a subsequence, the minimizers converge to a locally minimizing harmonic map in both the $ H_{\loc}^1 $ and $ C_{\loc}^j, j\in \Z_+ $ norms within compact subsets that are distant from the singularities of the limit. For the second case, we establish the existence of a closed set denoted as $ \cS_{\op{line}} $. This set has finite length and consists of finite segments of lines locally such that the energy of minimizers are locally uniformly bounded away from it. This work solves an open question raised by Canevari (ARMA, 223 (2017), 591-676), specifically concerning point and line defects in the Landau-de Gennes model with sextic potentials.</description>

      <title>Variational method for fractional Hamiltonian system in bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following fractional Hamiltonian system \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} \begin{aligned} (-\Delta)^{s} u&amp;=H_v(u,v) \;\;&amp;&amp;\text{in}~\Omega,\\ (-\Delta)^{s} v&amp;=H_u(u,v) &amp;&amp;\text{in}~\Omega,\\ u,\,&amp;v=0 &amp;&amp;\text{in} ~ \mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega, \end{aligned} \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $s\in (0,1)$, $N&gt;2s$, $H \in C^1(\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R})$ and $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain with $C^{1, 1}$ boundary. To apply the variational method for this problem, the key question is to find a suitable functional setting. Instead of the usual fractional Sobolev spaces we use the solutions space of $(-\Delta)^{s}u=f$, for which we show the related (compact) embedding properties. When $H$ has subcritical and superlinear growth, we construct two frameworks respectively with interpolation and dual method. Under some technical conditions, we show the existence of nontrivial solutions. Finally, we consider fractional Lane-Emden system, i.e. $H(u, v)=\frac{1}{p+1}|u|^{p+1}+\frac{1}{q+1}|v|^{q+1}$. With subcritical condition, we consider the existence, uniqueness and radially symmetry of positive solutions.</description>

      <title>The biharmonic optimal support problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a $\Gamma$-convergence result for $h\to 0$ of a thin nonlinearly elastic 3D-plate of thickness $h&gt;0$ which is assumed to be glued to a support region in the 2D-plane $x_3=0$ over the $h$-2D-neighborhood of a given closed set $K$. In the regime of very small vertical forces we identify the $\Gamma$-limit as being the bi-harmonic energy, with Dirichlet condition on the gluing region $K$, following a general strategy by Friesecke, James, and M\"uller that we have to adapt in presence of the glued region. Then we introduce a shape optimization problem that we call "optimal support problem" and which aims to find the best glued plate. In this problem the bi-harmonic energy is optimized among all possible glued regions $K$ that we assume to be connected and for which we penalize the length. By relating the dual problem with Griffith almost-minimizers, we are able to prove that any minimizer is $C^{1,\alpha}$ regular outside a set of Hausdorff dimension strictly less then one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper [16], the authors proposed a BGK model for relativistic gas mixtures based on the Marle-type approximation, which satisfies the fundamental kinetic properties: non-negativity of distribution functions, conservation laws, H-theorem, and indifferentiability principle. In this paper, we are concerned with the stationary problems to the relativistic BGK model for gas mixtures in slab geometry. We establish the existence of a unique mild solution with the fixed inflow boundary data when the collision frequencies for each species are sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>The long-time behavior of solutions of a three-component reaction-diffusion model for the population dynamics of farmers and hunter-gatherers: the different motility case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spreading properties of solutions of the Aoki-Shida-Shigesada model. This model is a three-component reaction-diffusion system that delineates the geographical expansion of an initially localized population of farmers into a region occupied by hunter-gatherers. By considering the scenario where farmers and hunter-gatherers possess identical motility, Aoki et al. previously concluded, through numerical simulations and some formal linearization arguments, that there are four different types of spreading behaviors depending on the parameter values. In this paper, we concentrate on the general case for which farmers and hunter-gatherers possess different motility. By providing more sophisticated estimates, we not only theoretically justify the spreading speed of the Aoki-Shida-Shigesada model, but also establish sharp estimates for the long-time behaviors of solutions. These estimates enable us to validate all four types of spreading behaviors observed by Aoki et al..</description>

      <title>Long time stability and instability in the two-dimensional Boussinesq system with kinematic viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the long-time behavior of the two-dimensional incompressible Boussinesq system with kinematic viscosity in a periodic channel, focusing on instability and asymptotic stability near hydrostatic equilibria. Firstly, we prove that any hydrostatic equilibrium reveals long-time instability when the initial data are perturbed in Sobolev spaces of low regularity. Secondly, we establish asymptotic stability of the stratified density, which is strictly decreasing in the vertical direction, under sufficiently regular perturbations, proving that the solution converges to the unique minimizer of the total energy.
  Our analysis is based on the energy method. Although the total energy dissipates due to kinematic viscosity, such mechanism cannot capture the stratification of the density. We overcome this difficulty by discovering another Lyapunov functional which exhibits the density stratification in a quantitative manner.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a kind of shallow water wave model called the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (KP-BBM) equation. We firstly consider the unperturbed KP-BBM equation. Then by using the geometric singular perturbation (GSP) theory, especially the invariant manifold theory, method of dynamical system and Melnikov function, the existence of solitary wave solutions of perturbed KP-BBM equation is proved. In other words, we dissuss the equation under different nonlinear terms. Finally, we validate our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity and the growth rates of solutions to two-dimensional Monge-Amp\`ere equations with the right-hand side exhibiting polynomial growth. Utilizing this analysis, we demonstrate that the translators for the flow by sub-affine-critical powers of the Gauss curvature are smooth, strictly convex entire graphs. These graphs exhibit specific growth rates that depend solely on the power of the flow.</description>

      <title>Non-existence and multiplicity of positive solutions for Choquard equations with critical combined nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-existence and multiplicity of positive solutions of the nonlinear Choquard type equation $$ -\Delta u+ \varepsilon u=(I_\alpha \ast |u|^{p})|u|^{p-2}u+ |u|^{q-2}u, \quad {\rm in} \ \mathbb R^N, \qquad (P_\varepsilon)$$ where $N\ge 3$ is an integer, $p\in [\frac{N+\alpha}{N}, \frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}]$, $q\in (2,\frac{2N}{N-2}]$, $I_\alpha$ is the Riesz potential of order $\alpha\in (0,N)$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a parameter. We fix one of $p,q$ as a critical exponent (in the sense of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev and Sobolev inequalities ) and view the others in $p,q,\varepsilon, \alpha$ as parameters, we find regions in the $(p,q,\alpha, \varepsilon)$-parameter space, such that the corresponding equation has no positive ground state or admits multiple positive solutions. This is a counterpart of the Brezis-Nirenberg Conjecture (Brezis-Nirenberg, CPAM, 1983) for nonlocal elliptic equation in the whole space. Particularly, some threshold results for the existence of ground states and some conditions which insure two positive solutions are obtained. These results are quite different in nature from the corresponding local equation with combined powers nonlinearity and reveal the special influence of the nonlocal term. To the best of our knowledge, the only two papers concerning the multiplicity of positive solutions of elliptic equations with critical growth nonlinearity are given by Atkinson, Peletier (Nonlinear Anal, 1986) for elliptic equation on a ball and Juncheng Wei, Yuanze Wu (Proc. Royal Soc. Edinburgh, 2022) for elliptic equation with a combined powers nonlinearity in the whole space. The ODE technique is main ingredient in the proofs of the above mentioned papers, however, ODE technique does not work any more in our model equation due to the presence of the nonlocal term.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of Convex Solutions to Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Systems: Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the monotonic and symmetric properties of convex solutions Monge-Amp\`ere systems for instance, considering
  \begin{equation*}
  \det(D^2u^i)=f^i(x,{\bf u},\nabla u^i), \ 1\leq i\leq m,
  \end{equation*} over unbounded domains of various cases, including the whole spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$, the half spaces $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ and the unbounded tube shape domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We obtain monotonic and symmetric properties of the solutions to the problem with respect to the geometry of domains and the monotonic and symmetric properties of right-hand side terms. The proof is based on carefully using the moving plane method together with various maximum principles and Hopf's lemmas.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation on Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Equations and Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following fully nonlinear elliptic equations \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{rl} \left(S_{k}(D^{2}u)\right)^{\frac1k}=\lambda f(-u) &amp; in\quad\Omega \\ u=0 &amp; on\quad \partial\Omega\\ \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} and coupled systems \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{rl} (S_{k}(D^{2}u))^\frac1k=\lambda g(-u,-v) &amp; in\quad\Omega \\ (S_{k}(D^{2}v))^\frac1k=\lambda h(-u,-v) &amp; in\quad\Omega \\ u=v=0 &amp; on\quad \partial\Omega\\ \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} dominated by $k$-Hessian operators, where $\Omega$ is a $(k$-$1)$-convex bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, $\lambda$ is a non-negative parameter, $f:\left[0,+\infty\right)\rightarrow\left[0,+\infty\right)$ is a continuous function with zeros only at $0$ and $g,h:\left[0,+\infty\right)\times \left[0,+\infty\right)\rightarrow \left[0,+\infty\right)$ are continuous functions with zeros only at $(\cdot,0)$ and $(0,\cdot)$. We determine the interval of $\lambda$ about the existence, non-existence, uniqueness and multiplicity of $k$-convex solutions to the above problems according to various cases of $f,g,h$, which is a complete supplement to the known results in previous literature. In particular, the above results are also new for Laplacian and Monge-Amp\`ere operators. We mainly use bifurcation theory, a-priori estimates, various maximum principles and technical strategies in the proof.</description>

      <title>A Harris theorem for enhanced dissipation, and an example of Pierrehumbert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many situations, the combined effect of advection and diffusion greatly increases the rate of convergence to equilibrium -- a phenomenon known as enhanced dissipation. Here we study the situation where the advecting velocity field generates a random dynamical system satisfying certain Harris conditions. If $\kappa$ denotes the strength of the diffusion, then we show that with probability at least $1 - o(\kappa^N)$ enhanced dissipation occurs on time scales of order $|\ln \kappa|$, a bound which is known to be optimal. Moreover, on long time scales, we show that the rate of convergence to equilibrium is almost surely independent of diffusivity. As a consequence we obtain enhanced dissipation for the randomly shifted alternating shears introduced by Pierrehumbert '94.</description>

      <title>On polynomial solutions to the minimal surface equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in finding nonlinear polynomials $P$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that solves the minimal surface equation.
  We first prove a structure theorem on such polynomials. We show that the highest degree term $P_m$ must factor as $P_0^kQ_m$ where $k$ is odd, $Q_m\ge 0$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $P_0$ is irreducible, and that the level sets of $P_m$ are all area minimizing. Moreover, the unique tangent cone of $\operatorname{graph} P$ at $\infty$ is $\{P_0=0\}\times\mathbb{R}$. If $k\ge 3$, we know further that lower order terms down to some degree are divisible by $P_0$.
  We also show that $P$ must contain terms of both high and low degree. In particular, it cannot be homogeneous. As a corollary, we prove that there is no quadratic or cubic polynomial solution.
  Using a general decay lower bound of Green's functions on minimal hypersurfaces we are able to show that $\operatorname{deg} P_0+k^{-1}\operatorname{deg} Q_m\le n-2$.
  Finally, we prove that a polynomial minimal graph cannot have $C\times \mathbb{R}^l$ as its tangent cone at $\infty$ where $l\ge 1$ and $C$ is any isoparametric cone. We also show that the existence of a nonlinear polynomial solutions on $\mathbb{R}^8$ will imply the existence of an area minimizing but not strictly minimizing cubic cone in $\mathbb{R}^8$. These results indicate that finding an explicit polynomial solution can be hard.</description>

      <title>Green's functions on minimal submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for the Green's function on an area-minimizing boundary, it is bounded below universally by the Euclidean Green's function. We also obtain asymptotics of the Green's function near the pole and infinity. These are done by proving a $C^\alpha$ convergence of the Green's functions under the convergence of area-minimizing boundaries. For converging multiplicity 1 stationary varifolds, we have $L^p$ convergence of the Green's functions, but there are examples of stationary varifolds on which the lower bounds and asymptotics may fail. An application of the lower bound will be given in [9].</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Cardano-Lyapunov Feedback for PDEs with Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inverse optimal control design for systems that are not affine in the control. In particular, we consider some classes of partial differential equations (PDEs) with quadratic convection and counter-convection, for which the L2 norm is a control Lyapunov function (CLF) whose derivative has either a depressed cubic or a quadratic dependence in the boundary control input. We also consider diffusive PDEs with or without linear convection, for which a weighted L2 norm is a CLF whose derivative has a quadratic dependence in the control input. For each structure on the derivative of the CLF, we achieve inverse optimality with respect to a meaningful cost functional. For the case where the derivative of the CLF has a depressed cubic dependence in the control, we construct a cost functional for which the unique minimizer is the unique real root of a cubic polynomial: the Cardano-Lyapunov controller. When the derivative of the CLF is quadratic in the control, we construct a cost functional that is minimized by two distinct feedback laws, that correspond to the two distinct real roots of a quadratic equation. We show how to switch from one root to the other to reduce the control effort.</description>

      <title>Robust and structure-preserving time-discretisation and linearisation schemes for singular and degenerate evolution systems arising in models for biofilm growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse numerical schemes for a system of quasilinear, degenerate evolution equations modelling biofilm growth as well as other processes such as flow through porous media and the spreading of wildfires. The first equation in the system is parabolic and exhibits degenerate and singular diffusion, while the second is either uniformly parabolic or an ordinary differential equation. First, we introduce a semi-implicit time discretisation that has the benefit of decoupling the equations. We prove the positivity, boundedness, and convergence of the time-discrete solutions to the time-continuous solution. Then, we introduce an iterative linearisation scheme to solve the resulting nonlinear time-discrete problems. Under weak assumptions on the time-step size, we prove that the scheme converges irrespective of the space discretisation and mesh. Moreover, if the problem is non-degenerate, the convergence becomes faster as the time-step size decreases. Finally, employing the finite element method for the spatial discretisation, we study the behaviour of the scheme, and compare its performance to other commonly used schemes. These tests confirm that the proposed scheme is robust and fast.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian free-field as a stream function: continuum version of the scale-by-scale homogenization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note is about a drift-diffusion process $X$ with a time-independent, divergence-free drift $b$, where $b$ is a smooth Gaussian field that decorrelates over large scales. In two space dimensions, this just fails to fall into the standard theory of stochastic homogenization, and leads to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. In a previous paper by Chatzigeorgiou, Morfe, Otto, and Wang (2022), precise asymptotics of the annealed second moments of $X$ were derived by characterizing the asymptotics of the effective diffusivity $\lambda_L$ in terms of an artificially introduced large-scale cut-off $L$. The latter was carried out by a scale-by-scale homogenization, and implemented by monitoring the corrector $\phi_L$ for geometrically increasing cut-off scales $L^+=ML$. In fact, proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ for the corrector and flux corrector were introduced incrementally and the residuum $f_L$ estimated.
  In this short supplementary note, we reproduce the arguments of the above paper in the continuum setting of $M\downarrow 1$. This has the advantage that the definition of the proxies $(\tilde\phi_L,\tilde\sigma_L)$ becomes more transparent -- it is given by a simple It\^{o} SDE with $\ln L$ acting as a time variable. It also has the advantage that the residuum $f_L$, which is a martingale, can be efficiently and precisely estimated by It\^{o} calculus. This relies on the characterization of the quadratic variation of the (infinite-dimensional) Gaussian driver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of a diffusion process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ advected by a stationary random vector field which is assumed to be divergence-free, dihedrally symmetric in law and have a log-correlated potential. A special case includes $\nabla^\perp$ of the Gaussian free field in two dimensions. We show the variance of the diffusion process at a large time $t$ behaves like $2 c_* t (\log t)^{1/2}$, in a quenched sense and with a precisely determined, universal prefactor constant $c_*&gt;0$. We also prove a quenched invariance principle under this superdiffusive scaling. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalization group argument in which we inductively analyze coarse-grained diffusivities, scale-by-scale. Our analysis leads to sharp homogenization and large-scale regularity estimates on the infinitesimal generator, which are subsequently transferred into quantitative information on the process.</description>

Abstract: We give examples on the use of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem in inverse problems. We show uniqueness in the linearized Calder\'on problem on holomorphically separable K\"ahler manifolds, and in the Calder\'on problem for nonlinear equations on conformally transversally anisotropic manifolds. We also study the holomorphic separability condition in terms of plurisubharmonic functions. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem allows us to generalize and simplify earlier results. It also makes it possible to circumvent the use of complex geometrical optics solutions and inversion of explicit transforms in certain cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show a number of logarithmic inequalities on several classes of Lie groups: log-Sobolev inequalities on general Lie groups, log-Sobolev (weighted and unweighted), log-Gagliardo-Nirenberg and log-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities on graded Lie groups. Furthermore, on stratified groups, we show that one of the obtained inequalities is equivalent to a Gross-type log-Sobolev inequality with the horizontal gradient. As a result, we obtain the Gross log-Sobolev inequality on general stratified groups but, {\bf very interestingly}, with the Gaussian measure on the first stratum of the group. Moreover, our methods also yield weighted versions of the Gross log-Sobolev inequality. In particular, we also obtain new weighted Gross-type log-Sobolev inequalities on $\mathbb R^n$ for arbitrary choices of homogeneous quasi-norms. As another consequence we derive the Nash inequalities on graded groups and an example application to the decay rate for the heat equations for sub-Laplacians on stratified groups. We also obtain weighted versions of log-Sobolev and Nash inequalities for general Lie groups.</description>

Abstract: Euler's elastica is defined by a critical point of the total squared curvature under the fixed length constraint, and its $L^p$-counterpart is called $p$-elastica. In this paper we completely classify all $p$-elasticae in the plane and obtain their explicit formulae as well as optimal regularity. To this end we introduce new types of $p$-elliptic functions which streamline the whole argument and result. As an application we also classify all closed planar $p$-elasticae.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the speed selection problem of the scalar reaction-diffusion equations and the two-species Lotka-Volterra competition systems. We propose a sufficient and necessary criterion for this long-standing problem of monostable dynamical systems for the first time, from a different point of view as compared to the classical result on single equations in [Lucia-Muratov-Novaga, CPAM 2004]. Moreover, our results can further reveal the essence of the linear determined problem from a new viewpoint on the decay rate of traveling wave solutions. Our results seem to be the first that provide a sufficient and necessary criterion for the speed selection of the two-species Lotka-Volterra competition system.</description>

      <title>Functional inequalities on symmetric spaces of noncompact type and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to begin a systematic study of functional inequalities on symmetric spaces of noncompact type of higher rank. Our first main goal of this study is to establish the Stein-Weiss inequality, also known as a weighted Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, for the Riesz potential on symmetric spaces of noncompact type. This is achieved by performing delicate estimates of ground spherical function with the use of polyhedral distance on symmetric spaces and by combining the integral Hardy inequality developed by Ruzhansky and Verma with the sharp Bessel-Green-Riesz kernel estimates on symmetric spaces of noncompact type obtained by Anker and Ji. As a consequence of the Stein-Weiss inequality, we deduce Hardy-Sobolev, Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev, Gagliardo-Nirenberg and Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities on symmetric spaces of noncompact type. The second main purpose of this paper is to show the applications of aforementioned inequalities for studying nonlinear PDEs on symmetric spaces. Specifically, we show that the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality can be used to establish small data global existence results for the semilinear wave equations with damping and mass terms for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on symmetric spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study global solutions to the thin obstacle problem with at most quadratic growth at infinity. We show that every ellipsoid can be realized as the contact set of such a solution.

Abstract: We study nonlocal elliptic and parabolic equations on $C^{1,\tau}$ open sets in weighted Sobolev spaces, where $\tau\in (0,1)$. The operators we consider are infinitesimal generators of symmetric stable L\'evy processes, whose L\'evy measures are allowed to be very singular. Additionally, for parabolic equations, the measures are assumed to be merely measurable in the time variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is the study of the inverse point-source scattering problem, specifically in relation to a certain class of electric potentials. Our research provides a novel uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data, obtained from the near field pattern. Our work improves the work of Caro and Garcia, who investigated both the direct problem and the inverse problem with global near field data for critically singular and $\delta$-shell potentials. The primary contribution of our research is the introduction of a Runge approximation result for the near field data on the scattering problem which, in combination with an interior regularity argument, enables us to establish a uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data. Additionaly, we manage to consider a slightly wider class of potentials.</description>

      <title>Energy balance and damage for dynamic brittle fracture from a nonlocal formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01861v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonlocal model of peridynamic type for dynamic brittle damage is introduced consisting of two phases, one elastic and the other inelastic. Evolution from the elastic to the inelastic phase depends on material strength. Existence and uniqueness of the displacement-failure set pair follow from the initial value problem. The displacement-failure pair satisfies energy balance. The length of nonlocality $\epsilon$ is taken to be small relative to the domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$. The new nonlocal model delivers a two point strain evolution on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}^d$. This evolution provides an energy that interpolates between volume energy corresponding to elastic behavior and surface energy corresponding to failure. In general the deformation energy resulting in material failure over a region $R$ is given by a $d-1$ dimensional integral that is uniformly bounded as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. For fixed $\epsilon$, the failure energy is nonzero for $d-1$ dimensional regions $R$ associated with flat crack surfaces. This failure energy is the Griffith fracture energy given by the energy release rate multiplied by area for $d=3$ (or length for $d=2$). The nonlocal field theory is shown to recover a solution of Naiver's equation outside a propagating flat traction free crack in the limit of vanishing spatial nonlocality. Simulations illustrate fracture evolution through generation of an internal traction free boundary as a wake left behind a moving strain concentration. Crack paths are seen to follow a maximal strain energy density criterion.</description>

Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to explore the multi-phase variant of quadrature domains associated with the Helmholtz equation, commonly referred to as $k$-quadrature domains. Our investigation employs both the minimization problem approach, which delves into the segregation ground state of an energy functional, and the partial balayage procedure, drawing inspiration from the recent work by Gardiner and Sj\"odin. Furthermore, we present practical applications of these concepts in the realms of acoustic waves and magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider here a fully discrete variant of the implicit variational scheme for mean curvature flow [AlmTayWan,LucStu], in a setting where the flow is governed by a crystalline surface tension defined by the limit of pairwise interactions energy on the discrete grid. The algorithm is based on a new discrete distance from the evolving sets, which prevents the occurrence of the spatial drift and pinning phenomena identified in [BraGelNov] in a similar discrete framework. We provide the first rigorous convergence result holding in any dimension, for any initial set and for a large class of purely crystalline anisotropies, in which the spatial discretization mesh can be of the same order or coarser than the time step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit asymptotic stability for the two-dimensional incompressible porous media equation and the Stokes transport system in a periodic channel. It is well-known that a stratified density, which strictly decreases in the vertical direction, is asymptotically stable under sufficiently small and smooth perturbations. We provide improvements in the regularity assumptions on the perturbation and in the convergence rate. Unlike the standard approach for stability analysis relying on linearized equations, we directly address the nonlinear problem by exploiting the energy structure of each system. While it is widely known that the potential energy is a Lyapunov functional in both systems, our key observation is that the second derivative of the potential energy reveals a (degenerate) coercive structure, which arises from the fact that the solution converges to the minimizer of the energy.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of Keller-Segel systems on compact metric graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemotaxis phenomena govern the directed movement of micro-organisms in response to chemical stimuli. In this paper, we investigate two Keller--Segel systems of reaction-advection-diffusion equations modeling chemotaxis on thin networks. The distinction between two systems is driven by the rate of diffusion of the chemo-attractant. The intermediate rate of diffusion is modeled by a coupled pair of parabolic equations, while the rapid rate is described by a parabolic equation coupled with an elliptic one. Assuming the polynomial rate of growth of the chemotaxis sensitivity coefficient, we prove local well-posedness of both systems on compact metric graphs, and, in particular, prove existence of unique classical solutions. This is achieved by constructing sufficiently regular mild solutions via analytic semigroup methods and combinatorial description of the heat kernel on metric graphs. The regularity of mild solutions is shown by applying abstract semigroup results to semi-linear parabolic equations on compact graphs. In addition, for logistic type Keller--Segel systems we prove global well-posedness and, in some special cases, global uniform boundedness of solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a wide class of curvature energy functionals defined for planar curves under the fixed-length constraint, we obtain optimal necessary conditions for global and local minimizers. Our results extend Maddocks' and Sachkov's rigidity principles for Euler's elastica by a new, unified and geometric approach. This in particular leads to complete classification of stable closed $p$-elasticae for all $p\in(1,\infty)$ and of stable pinned $p$-elasticae for $p\in(1,2]$. Our proof is based on a simple but robust `cut-and-paste' trick without computing the energy nor its second variation, which works well for planar periodic curves but also extends to some non-periodic or non-planar cases. An analytically remarkable point is that our method is directly valid for the highly singular regime $p\in(1,\frac{3}{2}]$ in which the second variation may not exist even for smooth variations.</description>

Abstract: Consider a non-negative, self-adjoint, maximally subelliptic operator on a compact manifold. We show that the spectral multiplier is a singular integral operator under an appropriate Mihlin-H\"ormander type condition. We establish the equivalence between non-isotropic Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces adapted to the operator and those adapted to a Carnot-Carath\'eodory geometry on the manifold. We also give a Mihlin-H\"ormander type condition for the boundedness of the spectral multiplier on non-isotropic $L^p$ Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hirota equation is one of the higher-order extensions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and can describe the ultra-short optical pulse propagation in the form $ iq_t+\alpha(q_{xx}+ 2|q|^2q)+i\beta (q_{xxx}+ 6|q|^2q_x)=0,\, (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2\, (\alpha,\,\beta\in\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we analytically explore the large-space and long-time asymptotic behaviors of a soliton gas (the limit $N\to \infty$ of $N$-soliton solutions) for the Hirota equation including the complex modified KdV equation by using the Riemann-Hilbert problems with discrete spectra restricted in intervals $(ia, ib)\cup (-ib, -ia)\, (0&lt;a&lt;b)$. We find that this soliton gas tends slowly to the Jaocbian elliptic wave solution with an error $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-1})$ (zero exponentially quickly ) as $x\to -\infty$ ($x\to +\infty$). We also present the long-time asymptotics of the soliton gas under the different velocity conditions: $x/t&gt;4\beta b^2,\, \xi_c&lt;x/t&lt;4\beta b^2,\, x/t&lt;\xi_c$. Moreover, we analyze the property of the soliton gas for the case of the discrete spectra filling uniformly a quadrature domain.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove gap results for complete self-shrinkers of the $r$-mean curvature flow involving a modified second fundamental form. These results extend previous results for self-shrinkers of the mean curvature flow due to Cao-Li and Cheng-Peng. To prove our results we show that, under suitable curvature bounds, proper self-shrinkers are parabolic for a certain second-order differential operator which generalizes the drifted Laplacian and, even if is not proper, this differential operator satisfies an Omori-Yau type maximum principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with an inverse wavenumber/frequency-dependent source problem for the Helmholtz equation. In two and three dimensions, the unknown source term is supposed to be compactly supported in spatial variables but independent on one spatial variable. The dependence of the source function on wavenumber/frequency is supposed to be unknown. Based on the Dirichlet-Laplacian and Fourier-Transform methods, we develop two effcient non-iterative numerical algorithms to recover the wavenumber-dependent source. Uniqueness proof and increasing stability analysis are carried out in terms of the boundary measurement data of Dirichlet kind. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.</description>
