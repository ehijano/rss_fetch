      <title>DeGAS: Gradient-Based Optimization of Probabilistic Programs without Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DeGAS, a differentiable Gaussian approximate semantics for loopless probabilistic programs that enables sample-free, gradient-based optimization in models with both continuous and discrete components. DeGAS evaluates programs under a Gaussian-mixture semantics and replaces measure-zero predicates and discrete branches with a vanishing smoothing, yielding closed-form expressions for posterior and path probabilities. We prove differentiability of these quantities with respect to program parameters, enabling end-to-end optimization via standard automatic differentiation, without Monte Carlo estimators. On thirteen benchmark programs, DeGAS achieves accuracy and runtime competitive with variational inference and MCMC. Importantly, it reliably tackles optimization problems where sampling-based baselines fail to converge due to conditioning involving continuous variables.</description>

      <title>Contextual Metaprogramming for Session Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the integration of staged metaprogramming into a session-typed message passing functional language. We build on a model of contextual modal type theory with multi-level contexts, where contextual values, closing arbitrary terms over a series of variables, may be boxed and transmitted in messages. Once received, one such value may then be unboxed and locally applied before being run. To motivate this integration, we present examples of real-world use cases, for which our system would be suitable, such as servers preparing and shipping code on demand via session typed messages. We present a type system that distinguishes linear (used exactly once) from unrestricted (used an unbounded number of times) resources, and further define a type checker, suitable for a concrete implementation. We show type preservation, a progress result for sequential computations and absence of runtime errors for the concurrent runtime environment, as well as the correctness of the type checker.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Language Models for ABAP Code Generation: An Empirical Study on Iterative Improvement by Compiler Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating ABAP code. Despite successful applications of generative AI in many programming languages, there are hardly any systematic analyses of ABAP code generation to date. The aim of the study is to empirically analyze to what extent various LLMs can generate syntactically correct and functional ABAP code, how effectively they use compiler feedback for iterative improvement, and which task types pose special challenges. For this purpose, a benchmark with 180 tasks is conducted, consisting of adapted HumanEval tasks and practical SAP scenarios. The results show significant performance differences between the models: more powerful LLMs achieve success rates of around 75% after several iterations and benefit greatly from compiler feedback, while smaller models perform significantly weaker. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of powerful LLMs for ABAP development processes, especially in iterative error correction.</description>

      <title>Generating Compilers for Qubit Mapping and Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To evaluate a quantum circuit on a quantum processor, one must find a mapping from circuit qubits to processor qubits and plan the instruction execution while satisfying the processor's constraints. This is known as the qubit mapping and routing (QMR) problem. High-quality QMR solutions are key to maximizing the utility of scarce quantum resources and minimizing the probability of logical errors affecting computation. The challenge is that the landscape of quantum processors is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving. Given this diversity, dozens of papers have addressed the QMR problem for different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error correction schemes by a developing a new algorithm for a particular context. We present an alternative approach: automatically generating qubit mapping and routing compilers for arbitrary quantum processors. Though each QMR problem is different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a compact domain-specific language for specifying QMR problems and a powerful parametric algorithm that can be instantiated for any QMR specification. Our thorough evaluation on case studies of important QMR problems shows that generated compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of runtime and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Validating Quantum State Preparation Programs (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05616v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the key steps in quantum algorithms is to prepare an initial quantum superposition state with different kinds of features. These so-called state preparation algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to develop correctly and effectively. This paper presents Pqasm: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant, allowing us to certify our Pqasm tool to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors. The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition. The reduction allows the development of an effective testing framework for testing quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer - considered to be a hard problem with no clear solution until this point. We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to test state preparation programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using Pqasm; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>A2H-MAS: An Algorithm-to-HLS Multi-Agent System for Automated and Reliable FPGA Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between algorithm development and hardware realization remains a persistent challenge, particularly in latency- and resource-constrained domains such as wireless communication. While MATLAB provides a mature environment for algorithm prototyping, translating these models into efficient FPGA implementations via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) often requires expert tuning and lengthy iterations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automating this process. However, existing approaches suffer from hallucinations, forgetting, limited domain expertise, and often overlook key performance metrics. To address these limitations, we present A2H-MAS, a modular and hierarchical multi-agent system. At the system level, A2H-MAS assigns clearly defined responsibilities to specialized agents and uses standardized interfaces and execution-based validation to ensure correctness and reproducibility. At the algorithmic level, it employs dataflow-oriented modular decomposition and algorithm-hardware co-design, recognizing that the choice of algorithm often has a larger impact on hardware efficiency than pragma-level optimization. Experiments on representative wireless communication algorithms show that A2H-MAS consistently produces functionally correct, resource-efficient, and latency-optimized HLS designs, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for complex hardware development workflows.</description>
