      <title>GriDB: Scaling Blockchain Database via Sharding and Off-Chain Cross-Shard Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain databases have attracted widespread attention but suffer from poor scalability due to underlying non-scalable blockchains. While blockchain sharding is necessary for a scalable blockchain database, it poses a new challenge named on-chain cross-shard database services. Each cross-shard database service (e.g., cross-shard queries or inter-shard load balancing) involves massive cross-shard data exchanges, while the existing cross-shard mechanisms need to process each cross-shard data exchange via the consensus of all nodes in the related shards (i.e., on-chain) to resist a Byzantine environment of blockchain, which eliminates sharding benefits. To tackle the challenge, this paper presents GriDB, the first scalable blockchain database, by designing a novel off-chain cross-shard mechanism for efficient cross-shard database services. Borrowing the idea of off-chain payments, GriDB delegates massive cross-shard data exchange to a few nodes, each of which is randomly picked from a different shard. Considering the Byzantine environment, the untrusted delegates cooperate to generate succinct proof for cross-shard data exchanges, while the consensus is only responsible for the low-cost proof verification. However, different from payments, the database services' verification has more requirements (e.g., completeness, correctness, freshness, and availability); thus, we introduce several new authenticated data structures (ADS). Particularly, we utilize consensus to extend the threat model and reduce the complexity of traditional accumulator-based ADS for verifiable cross-shard queries with a rich set of relational operators. Moreover, we study the necessity of inter-shard load balancing for a scalable blockchain database and design an off-chain and live approach for both efficiency and availability during balancing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Maximal Frequent Group Enumeration in Temporal Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cohesive subgraph mining is a fundamental problem in bipartite graph analysis. In reality, relationships between two types of entities often occur at some specific timestamps, which can be modeled as a temporal bipartite graph. However, the temporal information is widely neglected by previous studies. Moreover, directly extending the existing models may fail to find some critical groups in temporal bipartite graphs, which appear in a unilateral (i.e., one-layer) form. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel model, called maximal \lambda-frequency group (MFG). Given a temporal bipartite graph G=(U,V,E), a vertex set V_S \subseteq V is an MFG if i) there are no less than \lambda timestamps, at each of which V_S can form a (t_U,t_V)-biclique with some vertices in U at the corresponding snapshot, and ii) it is maximal. To solve the problem, a filter-and-verification (FilterV) method is proposed based on the Bron-Kerbosch framework, incorporating novel filtering techniques to reduce the search space and array-based strategy to accelerate the frequency and maximality verification. Nevertheless, the cost of frequency verification in each valid candidate set computation and maximality check could limit the scalability of FilterV to larger graphs. Therefore, we further develop a novel verification-free (VFree) approach by leveraging the advanced dynamic counting structure proposed. Theoretically, we prove that VFree can reduce the cost of each valid candidate set computation in FilterV by a factor of O(|V|). Furthermore, VFree can avoid the explicit maximality verification because of the developed search paradigm. Finally, comprehensive experiments on 15 real-world graphs are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques and model.</description>

      <title>An Interactive Multi-modal Query Answering System with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped traditional query-answering systems, offering unparalleled user experiences. However, existing retrieval techniques often struggle to handle multi-modal query contexts. In this paper, we present an interactive Multi-modal Query Answering (MQA) system, empowered by our newly developed multi-modal retrieval framework and navigation graph index, integrated with cutting-edge LLMs. It comprises five core components: Data Preprocessing, Vector Representation, Index Construction, Query Execution, and Answer Generation, all orchestrated by a dedicated coordinator to ensure smooth data flow from input to answer generation. One notable aspect of MQA is its utilization of contrastive learning to assess the significance of different modalities, facilitating precise measurement of multi-modal information similarity. Furthermore, the system achieves efficient retrieval through our advanced navigation graph index, refined using computational pruning techniques. Another highlight of our system is its pluggable processing framework, allowing seamless integration of embedding models, graph indexes, and LLMs. This flexibility provides users diverse options for gaining insights from their multi-modal knowledge base. A preliminary video introduction of MQA is available at https://youtu.be/xvUuo2ZIqWk.</description>

      <title>Releasing Large-Scale Human Mobility Histograms with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE) is a Google product that reports aggregate statistics about human mobility, including various methods of transit used by people across roughly 50,000 regions globally. These statistics are used to estimate carbon emissions and provided to policymakers to inform their decisions on transportation policy and infrastructure. Due to the inherent sensitivity of this type of user data, it is crucial that the statistics derived and released from it are computed with appropriate privacy protections. In this work, we use a combination of federated analytics and differential privacy to release these required statistics, while operating under strict error constraints to ensure utility for downstream stakeholders. In this work, we propose a new mechanism that achieves $ \epsilon \approx 2 $-DP while satisfying these strict utility constraints, greatly improving over natural baselines. We believe this mechanism may be of more general interest for the broad class of group-by-sum workloads.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Inductive Miner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting personal data about individuals, such as event traces in process mining, is an inherently difficult task: an event trace leaks information about the path in a process model that an individual has triggered. Yet, prior anonymization methods of event traces like k-anonymity or event log sanitization struggled to protect against such leakage, in particular against adversaries with sufficient background knowledge. In this work, we provide a method that tackles the challenge of summarizing sensitive event traces by learning the underlying process tree in a privacy-preserving manner. We prove via the so-called Differential Privacy (DP) property that from the resulting summaries no useful inference can be drawn about any personal data in an event trace. On the technical side, we introduce a differentially private approximation (DPIM) of the Inductive Miner. Experimentally, we compare our DPIM with the Inductive Miner on 8 real-world event traces by evaluating well-known metrics: fitness, precision, simplicity, and generalization. The experiments show that our DPIM not only protects personal data but also generates faithful process trees that exhibit little utility loss above the Inductive Miner.</description>

      <title>Efficient Materials Informatics between Rockets and Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The true power of computational research typically can lay in either what it accomplishes or what it enables others to accomplish. In this work, both avenues are simultaneously embraced across several distinct efforts existing at three general scales of abstractions of what a material is - atomistic, physical, and design. At each, an efficient materials informatics infrastructure is being built from the ground up based on (1) the fundamental understanding of the underlying prior knowledge, including the data, (2) deployment routes that take advantage of it, and (3) pathways to extend it in an autonomous or semi-autonomous fashion, while heavily relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to guide well-established DFT-based ab initio and CALPHAD-based thermodynamic methods.
  The resulting multi-level discovery infrastructure is highly generalizable as it focuses on encoding problems to solve them easily rather than looking for an existing solution. To showcase it, this dissertation discusses the design of multi-alloy functionally graded materials (FGMs) incorporating ultra-high temperature refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) towards gas turbine and jet engine efficiency increase reducing CO2 emissions, as well as hypersonic vehicles. It leverages a new graph representation of underlying mathematical space using a newly developed algorithm based on combinatorics, not subject to many problems troubling the community. Underneath, property models and phase relations are learned from optimized samplings of the largest and highest quality dataset of HEA in the world, called ULTERA. At the atomistic level, a data ecosystem optimized for machine learning (ML) from over 4.5 million relaxed structures, called MPDD, is used to inform experimental observations and improve thermodynamic models by providing stability data enabled by a new efficient featurization framework.</description>

      <title>PeFAD: A Parameter-Efficient Federated Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of mobile sensing techniques, huge amounts of time series data are generated and accumulated in various domains, fueling plenty of real-world applications. In this setting, time series anomaly detection is practically important. It endeavors to identify deviant samples from the normal sample distribution in time series. Existing approaches generally assume that all the time series is available at a central location. However, we are witnessing the decentralized collection of time series due to the deployment of various edge devices. To bridge the gap between the decentralized time series data and the centralized anomaly detection algorithms, we propose a Parameter-efficient Federated Anomaly Detection framework named PeFAD with the increasing privacy concerns. PeFAD for the first time employs the pre-trained language model (PLM) as the body of the client's local model, which can benefit from its cross-modality knowledge transfer capability. To reduce the communication overhead and local model adaptation cost, we propose a parameter-efficient federated training module such that clients only need to fine-tune small-scale parameters and transmit them to the server for update. PeFAD utilizes a novel anomaly-driven mask selection strategy to mitigate the impact of neglected anomalies during training. A knowledge distillation operation on a synthetic privacy-preserving dataset that is shared by all the clients is also proposed to address the data heterogeneity issue across clients. We conduct extensive evaluations on four real datasets, where PeFAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines by up to 28.74%.</description>
