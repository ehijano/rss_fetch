      <title>On the variational principle for a class of skew product transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a variational principle, between the fiber Bowen's topological entropy on conditional level sets of Birkhoff average and fiber measure-theoretical entropy, for the skew product transformation driven by a uniquely ergodic homeomorphism system satisfying Anosov and topological mixing on fibers property. We prove it by utilizing a fiber specification property. Moreover, we prove that such skew product transformation has specification property defined by Gundlach and Kifer. Employing their main results, every H\"older continuous potential has a unique equilibrium state, and we also establish a variational principle between the fiber measure-theoretic entropy and the fiber Bowen's topological entropy on conditional level sets of local entropy for such unique equilibrium state. Examples of systems under consideration are given, such as fiber Anosov maps on 2-dimension tori driven by any irrational rotation on circle and random composition of 2x2 area preserving positive matrices driven by uniquely ergodic subshift.</description>

      <title>Generalized nonautonomous dynamics through groupoid morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the notions of nonautonomous dynamics to arbitrary groups, through groupoid morphisms. This also presents a generalization of classic dynamical systems and group actions. We introduce the structure of cotranslations, as a specific kind of groupoid morphism, and establish a correspondence between cotranslations and skew-products. We give applications of cotranslations to nonautonomous equations, both in differences and differential. Our results delve into the differentiability of cotranslations, along with dimension invariance and diagonalization, utilizing a generalized notion of kinematic similarity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical characterization of central sets in adequate partial semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the methods from topological dynamics, H. Furstenberg introduced the notions of Central sets and proved the famous Central Sets Theorem which is the simultaneous extension of the van der Waerden and Hindman Theorem. Later N. Hindman and V. Bergelson found an equivalent formulation of Central sets in the set of natural numbers in terms of the algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of discrete semigroups. The general case was proved by H. Shi and H. Yang. Using the notions of ultrafilters, J. McLeod introduced the notions of Central sets for commutative adequate partial semigroups, however for noncommutative cases, Central sets can be defined similarly. In this article, introducing the notions of topological dynamics for partial semigroup actions, we find an equivalent dynamical characterization of central sets in partial semigroups\footnote{Recently in \cite{GTG}, authors attempted to do the same but in a different approach.}. Throughout our article, we follow the approach of N. Hindman and D. Strauss [N. Hindman, and D. Strauss: Algebra in the Stone-\v Cech compactification: theory and applications, second edition, de Gruyter, Berlin, 2012.].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact second countable group. We present a comprehensive treatment of the classical Hopf Decomposition (also known as the Conservative-Dissipative Decomposition) for general nonsingular $G$-spaces, and provide several fundamentally different characterizations of it. Subsequently, we establish a complete structure theorem for totally dissipative nonsingular $G$-spaces through the construction of \emph{Krengel $G$-spaces}, extending Krengel's structure theorem on flows.</description>

      <title>Delay compartment models from a stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compartment models with delay terms are widely used across a range of disciplines. The motivation to include delay terms varies across different contexts. In epidemiological and pharmacokinetic models, the delays are often used to represent an incubation period. In this work, we derive a compartment model with delay terms from an underlying non-Markov stochastic process. Delay terms arise when waiting times are drawn from a delay exponential distribution. This stochastic process approach allows us to preserve the physicality of the model, gaining understanding into the conditions under which delay terms can arise. By providing the conditions under which the delay exponential function is a probability distribution, we establish a critical value for the delay terms. An exact stochastic simulation method is introduced for the generalized model, enabling us to utilize the simulation in scenarios where intrinsic stochasticity is significant, such as when the population size is small. We illustrate the applications of the model and validate our simulation algorithm on examples drawn from epidemiology and pharmacokinetics.</description>

      <title>A new construction of counterexamples to the bounded orbit conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bounded orbit conjecture says that every homeomorphism on the plane with each of its orbits being bounded must have a fixed point. Brouwer's translation theorem asserts that the conjecture is true for orientation preserving homeomorphisms, but Boyles' counterexample shows that it is false for the orientation reversing case. In this paper, we give a more comprehensible construction of counterexamples to the conjecture. Roughly speaking, we construct an orientation reversing homeomorphisms $f$ on the square $J^2=[-1, 1]^2$ with $\omega(x, f)=\{(-1. 1), (1, 1)\}$ and $\alpha(x, f)=\{(-1. -1), (1, -1)\}$ for each $x\in (-1, 1)^2$. Then by a semi-conjugacy defined by pushing an appropriate part of $\partial J^2$ into $(-1, 1)^2$, $f$ induces a homeomorphism on the plane, which is a counterexample.</description>

      <title>Classification of 3-Node Restricted Excitatory-Inhibitory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify connected 3-node restricted excitatory-inhibitory networks, extending our previous paper (`Classification of 2-node Excitatory-Inhibitory Networks', Mathematical Biosciences 373 (2024) 109205). We assume that there are two node-types and two arrow-types, excitatory and inhibitory; all excitatory arrows are identical and all inhibitory arrows are identical; and excitatory (resp. inhibitory) nodes can only output excitatory (resp. inhibitory) arrows. The classification is performed under the following two network perspectives: ODE-equivalence and minimality; and valence less or equal to 2. The results of this and the previous work constitute a first step towards analysing dynamics and bifurcations of excitatory-inhibitory networks and have potential applications to biological network models.</description>

      <title>From the Lagrange Triangle to the Figure Eight Choreography: Proof of Marchal's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the three body problem with equal masses, we prove that the most symmetric continuation class of Lagrange's equilateral triangle solution, also referred to as the $P_{12}$ family of Marchal, contains the remarkable figure eight choreography discovered by Moore in 1993, and proven to exist by Chenciner and Montgomery in 2000. This settles a conjecture of Marchal which dates back to the 1999 conference on Celestial Mechanics in Evanston Illinois, celebrating Donald Saari's 60th birthday.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on tools that have been successfully used in the study of rational billiards, such as induced maps and interval exchange transformations, we provide a construction of a one-parameter family of isosceles triangles exhibiting non-periodic trajectories that are not everywhere dense. This provides, by elementary means, a definitive negative answer to a long-standing open question on the density of non-periodic trajectories in triangular billiards.</description>

      <title>Analytic bounds on late-time axion-scalar cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics of multiple scalar/pseudoscalar fields are difficult to solve, especially when the field-space metric is curved. This presents a challenge in determining whether a given model can support cosmic acceleration, without solving for the on-shell solution. In this work, we present bounds on late-time FLRW-cosmologies in classes of theories that involve arbitrary numbers of scalar and pseudoscalar fields coupled both kinetically (leading to a curved field space metric) and through scalar potentials. Such bounds are proven analytically, independently of initial conditions, with no approximation in the field equations and without referring to explicit solutions. Besides their broad applications to cosmological model building, our bounds can be applied to studying asymptotic cosmologies of certain classes of string compactifications.</description>

      <title>Efficient, Multimodal, and Derivative-Free Bayesian Inference With Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible.
  While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii).
  The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.</description>

      <title>A representation-theoretical approach to higher-dimensional Lie--Hamilton systems: The symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4, \mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new procedure for the construction of higher-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems is proposed. This method is based on techniques belonging to the representation theory of Lie algebras and their realization by vector fields. The notion of intrinsic Lie-Hamilton system is defined, and a sufficiency criterion for this property given. Novel four-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4, \mathbb{R})$ are obtained and proved to be intrinsic. Two distinguished subalgebras, the two-photon Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}_{6}$ and the Lorentz Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$, are also considered in detail. As applications, coupled time-dependent systems which generalize the Bateman oscillator and the one-dimensional Caldirola-Kanai models are constructed, as well as systems depending on a time-dependent electromagnetic field and generalized coupled oscillators. A superposition rule for these systems, exhibiting interesting symmetry properties, is obtained using the coalgebra method.</description>

      <title>On the chaotic behavior of the Lagrangian flow of the 2D Navier-Stokes system with bounded degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a fluid governed by the randomly forced 2D Navier-Stokes system. It is assumed that the force is bounded, acts directly only on a small number of Fourier modes, and satisfies some natural decomposability and observability properties. Under these assumptions, we show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the random fluid exhibits chaotic behavior characterized by the strict positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent. To achieve this, we introduce a new abstract result that allows to derive positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent from controllability properties of the underlying deterministic system.</description>

      <title>Transverse surfaces and pseudo-Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\varphi$ be a transitive pseudo-Anosov flow on an oriented, compact $3$-manifold $M$, possibly with toral boundary. We characterize the surfaces in $M$ that are (almost) transverse to $\phi$. When $\varphi$ has no perfect fits (e.g. $\varphi$ is the suspension flow of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism), we prove that any Thurston-norm minimizing surface $S$ that pairs nonnegatively with the closed orbits of $\varphi$ is almost transverse to $\varphi$, up to isotopy. This answers a question of Cooper--Long--Reid. Our main tool is a correspondence between surfaces that are almost transverse to $\varphi$ and those that are relatively carried by any associated veering triangulation. The correspondence also allows us to investigate the uniqueness of almost transverse position, to extend Mosher's Transverse Surface Theorem to the case with boundary, and more generally to characterize when relative homology classes represent Birkhoff surfaces.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. Our method preserves properties of density matrices such as Hermitian symmetry and constant trace. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This derivation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>A macroscopic pedestrian model with variable maximal density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel macroscopic (fluid dynamics) model for describing pedestrian flow in low and high density regimes. The model is characterized by the fact that the maximal density reachable by the crowd - usually a fixed model parameter - is instead a state variable. To do that, the model couples a conservation law, devised as usual for tracking the evolution of the crowd density, with a Burgers-like PDE with a nonlocal term describing the evolution of the maximal density. The variable maximal density is used here to describe the effects of the psychological/physical pushing forces which are observed in crowds during competitive or emergency situations. Specific attention is also dedicated to the fundamental diagram, i.e., the function which expresses the relationship between crowd density and flux. Although the model needs a well defined fundamental diagram as known input parameter, it is not evident a priori which relationship between density and flux will be actually observed, due to the time-varying maximal density. An a posteriori analysis shows that the observed fundamental diagram has an elongated "tail" in the congested region, thus resulting similar to the concave/concave fundamental diagram with a "double hump" observed in real crowds. The main features of the model are investigated through 1D and 2D numerical simulations. The numerical code for the 1D simulation is freely available at https://gitlab.com/cristiani77/code_arxiv_2406.14649</description>

Abstract: Cyclic contractions generalize the usual contractivities in metric spaces and $b$-MSs. In this paper, we enhance several fixed point theorems related to cyclic (i) Banach self-maps, (ii) Chatterjea contractivities, (iii) Kannan self-mappings, (iv) \'{C}iri\'c and Hardy-Rogers, and (v) Reich contractions including local versions in $b$-metric spaces while also delineating the associated dynamics. Especially noteworthy is the expansion of the results concerning both fixed and periodic points, which are substantiated across a wider spectrum of ratio values for the aforementioned cyclic contractions within this class of spaces. Additionally, the convergence of Picard iterations towards the fixed point is rigorously established.</description>

      <title>Robust non-computability of dynamical systems and computability of robust dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14448v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the relationship between the stability of the dynamical system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ and the computability of its basins of attraction. We present a computable $C^{\infty}$ system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ that possesses a computable and stable equilibrium point, yet whose basin of attraction is robustly non-computable in a neighborhood of $f$ in the sense that both the equilibrium point and the non-computability of its associated basin of attraction persist when $f$ is slightly perturbed. This indicates that local stability near a stable equilibrium point alone is insufficient to guarantee the computability of its basin of attraction. However, we also demonstrate that the basins of attraction associated with a structurally stable - globally stable (robust) - planar system defined on a compact set are computable. Our findings suggest that the global stability of a system and the compactness of the domain play a pivotal role in determining the computability of its basins of attraction.</description>

      <title>Spectral Distribution of Twisted Laplacian on Typical Hyperbolic Surfaces of High Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral distribution of the twisted Laplacian associated with uniform square-integrable bounded harmonic 1-form on typical hyperbolic surfaces of high genus. First, we estimate the spectral distribution by the supremum norm of the corresponding harmonic form. Subsequently, we show that the square-integrable bounded harmonic form exhibits a small supremum norm for typical hyperbolic surfaces of high genus. Based on these findings, we prove a uniform Weyl law for the distribution of real parts of the spectrum on typical hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Stability of solutions of stationary Boussinesq systems on weak-Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the asymptotic stability of steady solutions for the Boussinesq systems in the framework of Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n \geqslant 3$. In our strategy, we first establish the continuity for the long time of the bilinear terms associated with the mild solutions of the Boussinesq systems, i.e., the bilinear estimates by using only the norm of the present spaces. As a direct consequence, we obtain the existence of global small mild solutions and asymptotic stability of steady solutions of the Boussinesq systems in the class of continuous functions from $[0, \infty)$ to the Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces. Our techniques consist interpolation of operators, duality, heat semigroup estimates , Holder and Young inequalities in block spaces (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey-Lorentz spaces.</description>

      <title>Mean-Square Exponential Stabilization of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic PDE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control of mixed-autonomy traffic where Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) coexist on the road has gained increasing attention over the recent decades. This paper addresses the boundary stabilization problem for mixed traffic on freeways. The traffic dynamics are described by uncertain coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with Markov jumping parameters, which aim to address the distinctive driving strategies between AVs and HVs. Considering that the spacing policies of AVs vary in mixed traffic, the stochastic impact area of AVs is governed by a continuous Markov chain. The interactions between HVs and AVs such as overtaking or lane changing are mainly induced by impact areas. Using backstepping design, we develop a full-state feedback boundary control law to stabilize the deterministic system (nominal system). Applying Lyapunov analysis, we demonstrate that the nominal backstepping control law is able to stabilize the traffic system with Markov jumping parameters, provided the nominal parameters are sufficiently close to the stochastic ones on average. The mean-square exponential stability conditions are derived, and the results are validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Poincar\'e-Birkhoff Theorem for Asymptotically Linear Hamiltonian Diffeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a twist condition, inspired by the classical Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem on area-preserving maps of the annulus, which applies to asymptotically linear Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of linear phase space. When an asymptotically linear Hamiltonian diffeomorphism, non-degenerate and unitary at infinity, satisfies this twist condition, we show that it has infinitely many periodic points.</description>

      <title>The Choquet-Deny Property for Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A countable discrete group is called Choquet-Deny if for any non-degenerate probability measure on the group, the corresponding space of bounded harmonic functions is trivial. Building on the previous work of Jaworski, a complete characterization of Choquet-Deny groups was recently achieved by Frisch, Hartman, Tamuz, and Ferdowski. In this article, we extend the study of the Choquet-Deny property to the framework of discrete measured groupoids. Our primary result offers a complete characterization of this property in terms of the isotropy groups and the equivalence relation associated with the given groupoid. Additionally, we use the implications derived from our main theorem to classify the Choquet-Deny property of transformation groupoids.</description>
