      <title>Why does the membrane potential of biological neuron develop and remain stable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neuronal electric operation can entirely be described by physics provided that we take into account that slow positive ions instead of fast light electrons are the charge carriers that biology uses. Based on the slow ions, we derive the correct physical model that Hodgkin and Huxley wanted. By using laws of electricity and thermodynamics in a non-disciplinary way, we derive the resting potential from the first principles of science, from the biological "construction" (the thickness of the isolating semipermeable membrane and the presence of ion channels in the walls of the membrane separating ionic solutions). We show that a simple control circuit regulates neuronal operation, between a resting and a transient state and that issuing an Action Potential is part of the control process. We explain that the resting potential is the consequence of charge separation instead of an ad-hoc linear combination of mobilities or reversal potentials as the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation claimed. 
We defy the hypothesis suggested by HH that some "leakage current" produces the resting potential; this way solve the decades-old mystery of "heat absorption" by neurons, the controversy of the experienced and theoretically expected energy consumption of neural computing. We fix the mistakes HH guessed in the physical picture behind their empirical model and mathematical equations, and introduce the correct physical model by providing also its detailed mathematical description.</description>

      <title>Balancing the Last Birth: A Game-Theoretical Resolution to the Human Sex Ratio Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of offspring sex ratios using a game-theoretical model in which the decision to have another child depends on the sex of the previous child. Motivated by higher male infant mortality and the tendency to try again after a child's death, our model allows different continuation probabilities after sons and daughters. We find that a stable sex ratio at birth (SRB) differing from 1:1 can arise when these continuation probabilities differ. However, the sex ratio among last-born children (SRLB) always converges to 1:1. We mathematically prove that this 1:1 SRLB is an evolutionarily stable strategy under a new fitness measure based on the number of offspring in successful mating pairs, rather than the number of descendants in the whole population. Our results generalize Fisher's principle by showing that equilibrium is maintained at the level of last births even when the overall SRB is biased. This offers a potential explanation for the persistent slight male bias in human births, linking it to sex-specific child mortality and parental reproductive strategies in historical populations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Antibody Kinetics Post Infection and Vaccination: A Markov Chain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing the time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or vaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence antibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent years and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on antibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination prevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the complexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a sample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a rigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We demonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to as personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking the probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To illustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from individuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics that could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural immunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level, and inform booster timing recommendations.</description>

      <title>Rate-independent hysteretic energy dissipation in collagen fibrils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoindentation cycles measured with an atomic force microscope on hydrated collagen fibrils exhibit a rate-independent hysteresis with return point memory. This previously unknown energy dissipation mechanism describes in unified form elastoplastic indentation, capillary adhesion, and surface leveling at indentation velocities smaller than 1 $\mu$m s$^{-1}$, where viscous friction is negligible. A generic hysteresis model, based on force-distance data measured during one large approach-retract cycle, predicts the force (output) and the dissipated energy for arbitrary indentation trajectories (input). While both quantities are rate independent, they do depend nonlinearly on indentation history and on indentation amplitude.</description>

      <title>BioScore: A Foundational Scoring Function For Diverse Biomolecular Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural assessment of biomolecular complexes is vital for translating molecular models into functional insights, shaping our understanding of biology and aiding drug discovery. However, current structure-based scoring functions often lack generalizability across diverse biomolecular systems. We present BioScore, a foundational scoring function that addresses key challenges -- data sparsity, cross-system representation, and task compatibility -- through a dual-scale geometric graph learning framework with tailored modules for structure assessment and affinity prediction. BioScore supports a wide range of tasks, including affinity prediction, conformation ranking, and structure-based virtual screening. Evaluated on 16 benchmarks spanning proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and carbohydrates, BioScore consistently outperforms or matches 70 traditional and deep learning methods. Our newly proposed PPI Benchmark further enables comprehensive evaluation of protein-protein complex scoring. BioScore demonstrates broad applicability: (1) pretraining on mixed-structure data boosts protein-protein affinity prediction by up to 40% and antigen-antibody binding correlation by over 90%; (2) cross-system generalizability enables zero- and few-shot prediction with up to 71% correlation gain; and (3) its unified representation captures chemically challenging systems such as cyclic peptides, improving affinity prediction by over 60%. BioScore establishes a robust and generalizable framework for structural assessment across complex biomolecular landscapes.</description>

      <title>Disordered Photosynthetic Aggregates Can Host Functional Vibronic Couplings At Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photosynthesis relies on a network of chlorophyll-like molecules which together lead to efficient long-range energy funneling. Evidence at cryogenic temperatures suggests that mechanistic details of energy/charge transfer must invoke delocalized vibronic states. Whether these survive at physiological temperature in large photosynthetic aggregates is an open question. Parallel research on artificial templates has relied on cyanines which are unlike chlorophylls. We report two-dimensional electronic spectra of porphyrin nanotubes where we selectively probe mixed Qx-Qy states through polarization control. Early time cross-peaks, their rapid broadening and survival of anisotropic Qx-Qy quantum beats conclusively demonstrate that overlapping vibrational-electronic bands of photosynthetic aggregates indeed host functional vibronic couplings at room temperature. Calculations reveal that disorder is the vital ingredient that dramatically enhances Qx-Qy vibronic mixing across the entire Q band. The parameter regime where energetic disorder is of the order of dense Raman-active vibrations with weak reorganization energies may be the key design principle.</description>

      <title>Integrating nano- and micrometer-scale energy deposition models for mechanistic prediction of radiation-induced DNA damage and cell survival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an integrated modeling framework that combines the Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model (GSM2), used to predict cell survival fractions, with MINAS-TIRITH, a fast and efficient Geant4 DNA-based tool for simulating radiation-induced DNA damage in cell populations. This approach enables the generation of spatially and structurally resolved double-strand break (DSB) distributions, capturing key features such as damage complexity and chromosome specificity. A novel application of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is introduced to group DSBs at the micrometer scale. This allows the identification of physical aggregates of DNA damage and their association with subnuclear domains, providing a direct link to the cell survival probability as predicted by \gsm.
  The model was validated using experimental data from HUVEC cells irradiated with 220 kV X-rays and H460 cells exposed to protons over a wide linear energy transfer (LET) range, from approximately 4 keV/{\mu}m to over 20 keV/{\mu}m. Results show excellent agreement between simulations and experimental survival probabilities, making this one of the first consistent multi-scale models to bridge nanodosimetric and microdosimetric representations of radiation with biological outcomes such as cell survival.
  By incorporating the inherent stochastic nature of radiation-matter interactions, this framework effectively connects the physical properties of the radiation field to the biological response at the cellular level. Its accuracy across various radiation types and energies supports its potential for use in biologically optimized radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Unleashing Urease Protein Dynamics with Metamaterial Optical Tweezers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the dynamics of single biomolecules is essential for unlocking new frontiers in biophysics and medicine. Here, we present a transformative approach using metamaterial optical tweezers to trap and study individual urease molecules - an enzyme that catalyzes urea hydrolysis and serves as a key biomarker for pathogenic infections. By generating thermally induced drifts and rapid hydrodynamic flows with optically induced local temperature fields at the metamaterial/water interface, we achieve unprecedented guidance and control over single urease molecules at low trapping laser intensities of 0.13~mW/{\mu}m^2 facilitating their precise delivery to plasmonic hotspots. The interplay of thermophoresis, thermo-osmosis and depletion forces shapes the trapping potential, enabling real-time observation of ureases` conformational changes and interactions with the environment. This innovative approach not only enhances our understanding of enzyme dynamics but also paves the way for label-free characterization of biomolecules, ushering in a new era in life sciences and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacterial colonies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid flow has a major effect on the aggregation and fragmentation of bacterial colonies. Yet, a generic framework to understand and predict how hydrodynamics affects colony size remains elusive. This study investigates how fluid flow affects the formation and maintenance of large colonial structures in cyanobacteria, using an experimental technique that precisely controls hydrodynamic conditions. We performed experiments on laboratory cultures and lake samples of the cyanobacterium Microcystis, while their colony size distribution was measured simultaneously by direct microscopic imaging. We demonstrate that EPS-embedded cells formed by cell division exhibit significant mechanical resistance to shear forces. However, at elevated hydrodynamic stress levels (exceeding those typically generated by surface wind mixing) these colonies experience fragmentation through an erosion process. We also show that single cells can aggregate into small colonies due to fluid flow. However, the structural integrity of these flow-induced colonies is weaker than that of colonies formed by cell division. We provide a mathematical analysis to support the experiments and demonstrate that a population model with two categories of colonies describes the measured size distributions. Our results shed light on the specific conditions wherein flow-induced fragmentation and aggregation of cyanobacteria are decisive and indicate that colony formation under natural conditions is mainly driven by cell division, although flow-induced aggregation could play a role in dense bloom events. These findings can be used to improve prediction models and mitigation strategies for toxic cyanobacterial blooms and also offer potential applications in other areas such as algal biotechnology or medical settings where the dynamics of biological aggregates play a significant role.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Parameter Inference and Uncertainty Quantification for a Computational Pulmonary Hemodynamics Model Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subject-specific modeling is a powerful tool in cardiovascular research, providing insights beyond the reach of current clinical diagnostics. Limitations in available clinical data require the incorporation of uncertainty into models to improve guidance for personalized treatments. However, for clinical relevance, such modeling must be computationally efficient. In this study, we used a one-dimensional (1D) fluid dynamics model informed by experimental data from a dog model of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), incorporating measurements from multiple subjects under both baseline and CTEPH conditions. Surgical intervention can alleviate CTEPH, yet patients with microvascular disease (e.g., remodeling and narrowing of small vessels) often exhibit persistent pulmonary hypertension, highlighting the importance of assessing microvascular disease severity. Thus, each lung was modeled separately to account for the heterogeneous nature of CTEPH, allowing us to explore lung-specific microvascular narrowing and resistance. We compared inferred parameters between baseline and CTEPH and examined their correlation with clinical markers of disease severity. To accelerate model calibration, we employed Gaussian process (GP) emulators, enabling the estimation of microvascular parameters and their uncertainties within a clinically feasible timeframe. Our results demonstrated that CTEPH leads to heterogeneous microvascular adaptation, reflected in distinct parameter shifts. Notably, the changes in model parameters strongly correlated with disease severity, especially in the lung previously reported to have more advanced disease. This framework provides a rapid, uncertainty-aware method for evaluating microvascular dysfunction in CTEPH and may support more targeted treatment strategies within a timeframe suitable for clinical application.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Traits as Dynamical Systems: Utilizing Entropy to Analyze Longitudinal Psychometric Data in Coupled Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traits such as neuroticism persist across species despite exhibiting characteristics typically regarded as maladaptive. This paper introduces a systems-based framework for understanding trait-stability, integrating findings from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study on Aging (SATSA) with a biologically grounded system of coupled ordinary differential equations. To enable dynamical modeling, Shannon entropy is extracted from longitudinal Likert-scale psychometric data, and is treated as a population-level signal of behavioral dispersion, reducing high-dimensional Likert data into low-dimensional trajectories. These trajectories serve as dynamical variables in the ODE framework, which is governed by principles from evolutionary biology, including mutation-selection balance, genetic pleiotropy, and metabolic constraints. The model is benchmarked against a null (uncoupled) system and additionally validated through multiple stress tests using RMSE, R^2, and dynamic time warping metrics. By embedding environmental feedback as a recursive driver of phenotypic expression, traits such as neuroticism are framed not as stochastic byproducts, but as emergent, multi-stable attractors within a biologically constrained system. The resulting Entropy-Coupled Trait ODEs (ECTO) reveal structured attractor dynamics and demonstrate that entropy functions not merely as a descriptive measure, but as a functional driver of behavioral evolution. This approach provides a scalable, mathematically grounded foundation for modeling phenotypic traits, with future applications to machine learning, multi-omic behavioral modeling, and related complex systems domains. By bridging psychometrics, evolutionary theory, and systems modeling, this work offers a general method for understanding long-term trait stability through recursive information-theoretic dynamics.</description>
