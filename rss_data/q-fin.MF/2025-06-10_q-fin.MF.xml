      <title>Stochastic portfolio theory with price impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for stochastic portfolio theory (SPT), which incorporates modern nonlinear price impact and impact decay models. Our main result derives the celebrated master formula for (additive) functional generation of trading strategies in a general high-dimensional market model with price impact. We also develop formulas for an investor's relative wealth with respect to the market portfolio, conditions that guarantee positive observed market prices and derive a stochastic differential equation governing the dynamics of the observed price, investor's holdings and price impact processes. As an application of these results, we develop conditions for relative arbitrage in the price impact setting analogous to previously obtained results for the frictionless setting. Numerical experiments are presented to complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Strategies: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Robust Financial Optimization through Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of model uncertainty in quantitative finance, where decisions in portfolio allocation, derivative pricing, and risk management rely on estimating stochastic models from limited data. In practice, the unavailability of the true probability measure forces reliance on an empirical approximation, and even small misestimations can lead to significant deviations in decision quality. Building on the framework of Klibanoff et al. (2005), we enhance the conventional objective - whether this is expected utility in an investing context or a hedging metric - by superimposing an outer "uncertainty measure", motivated by traditional monetary risk measures, on the space of models. In scenarios where a natural model distribution is lacking or Bayesian methods are impractical, we propose an ad hoc subsampling strategy, analogous to bootstrapping in statistical finance and related to mini-batch sampling in deep learning, to approximate model uncertainty. To address the quadratic memory demands of naive implementations, we also present an adapted stochastic gradient descent algorithm that enables efficient parallelization. Through analytical, simulated, and empirical studies - including multi-period, real data and high-dimensional examples - we demonstrate that uncertainty measures outperform traditional mixture of measures strategies and our model-agnostic subsampling-based approach not only enhances robustness against model risk but also achieves performance comparable to more elaborate Bayesian methods.</description>
