      <title>Predicting cell-specific gene expression profile and knockout impact through deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene expression data is essential for understanding how genes are regulated and interact within biological systems, providing insights into disease pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Gene knockout has proven to be a fundamental technique in molecular biology, allowing the investigation of the function of specific genes in an organism, as well as in specific cell types. However, gene expression patterns are quite heterogeneous in single-cell transcriptional data from a uniform environment, representing different cell states, which produce cell-type and cell-specific gene knockout impacts. A computational method that can predict the single-cell resolution knockout impact is still lacking. Here, we present a data-driven framework for learning the mapping between gene expression profiles derived from gene assemblages, enabling the accurate prediction of perturbed expression profiles following knockout (KO) for any cell, without relying on prior perturbed data. We systematically validated our framework using synthetic data generated from gene regulatory dynamics models, two mouse knockout single-cell datasets, and high-throughput in vitro CRISPRi Perturb-seq data. Our results demonstrate that the framework can accurately predict both expression profiles and KO effects at the single-cell level. Our approach provides a generalizable tool for inferring gene function at single-cell resolution, offering new opportunities to study genetic perturbations in contexts where large-scale experimental screens are infeasible.</description>

      <title>RawBench: A Comprehensive Benchmarking Framework for Raw Nanopore Signal Analysis Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing technologies continue to advance rapidly, offering critical benefits such as real-time analysis, the ability to sequence extremely long DNA fragments (up to millions of bases in a single read), and the option to selectively stop sequencing a molecule before completion. Traditionally, the raw electrical signals generated during sequencing are converted into DNA sequences through a process called basecalling, which typically relies on large neural network models. Raw signal analysis has emerged as a promising alternative to these resource-intensive approaches. While attempts have been made to benchmark conventional basecalling methods, existing evaluation frameworks 1) overlook raw signal analysis techniques, 2) lack the flexibility to accommodate new raw signal analysis tools easily, and 3) fail to include the latest improvements in nanopore datasets. Our goal is to provide an extensible benchmarking framework that enables designing and comparing new methods for raw signal analysis. To this end, we introduce RawBench, the first flexible framework for evaluating raw nanopore signal analysis techniques. RawBench provides modular evaluation of three core pipeline components: 1) reference genome encoding (using different pore models), 2) signal encoding (through various segmentation methods), and 3) representation matching (via different data structures). We extensively evaluate raw signal analysis techniques in terms of 1) quality and performance for read mapping, 2) quality and performance for read classification, and 3) quality of raw signal analysis-assisted basecalling. Our evaluations show that raw signal analysis can achieve competitive quality while significantly reducing resource requirements, particularly in settings where real-time processing or edge deployment is necessary.</description>

      <title>Generalized promotion time cure model: A new modeling framework to identify cell-type-specific genes and improve survival prognosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity for dissecting the interplay between the cancer cells and the associated tumor microenvironment, and the produced high-dimensional omics data should also augment existing survival modeling approaches for identifying tumor cell type-specific genes predictive of cancer patient survival. However, there is no statistical model to integrate multiscale data including individual-level survival data, multicellular-level cell composition data and cellular-level single-cell omics covariates. We propose a class of Bayesian generalized promotion time cure models (GPTCMs) for the multiscale data integration to identify cell-type-specific genes and improve cancer prognosis. We demonstrate with simulations in both low- and high-dimensional settings that the proposed Bayesian GPTCMs are able to identify cell-type-associated covariates and improve survival prediction.</description>
