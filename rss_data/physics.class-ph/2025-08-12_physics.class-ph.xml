      <title>Proposal for fast computational method for Hertz contact theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast computational method for Hertz contact theory is proposed. An incremental formula is introduced to calculate the ellipticity of the contact disk when two elastic bodies are in contact. This method can determine the ellipticity with good accuracy in a small number of iterations is reported. This method is also shown to be applicable from the case of a near perfect circle to the case where the major diameter is sufficiently long compared to the minor diameter.</description>

      <title>Particle manipulations based on acoustic valley topological rainbow defect-state trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12381v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic microfluidic is an important technology in particle manipulations in biomedical analyses and detections. However, the particle-movement manipulations achieved by the standing surface acoustic wave is suitable for particles in a thin layer of fluids, however it is difficult to manipulate particles in deeper solutions due to the energy loss of surface acoustic waves. The traditional standing bulk wave method can realize the particle manipulation in deep solutions, but it cannot work properly for particle manipulation within a long distance due to the energy loss. In this work, the topological rainbow defect-state trapping is realized, the results show that an effect of point accumulation of acoustic pressure in the waveguide path exists, the position of maximum acoustic pressure can be adjusted flexibly by changing the frequency of the incident acoustic wave, based on which, long-distance movement and capture manipulations of particles in deep solution have been realized. The phenomenon presented in this work can provide a reliable method for manipulations of continuous long-distance particle movement and capture to meet the demand of multiple processing steps in biochemical analyses and detections. The experiment verification results will be presented in the near future.</description>

      <title>Magnetic moments in the Poynting theorem, Maxwell equations, Dirac equation, and QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of magnetic moments in classical and quantum electrodynamics is examined in this work. The effects are described by a classical extended Poynting theorem and extended Maxwell equations and by conventional quantum electrodynamics expressed in terms of electromagnetic fields. Both descriptions take into account energetics of the interaction of magnetic moments with inhomogeneous magnetic fields. We show how magnetic moment effects are included in either version of electrodynamics and that these apparently different formulations can give consistent results. In either case, we express the interactions in terms of electromagnetic fields only, avoiding use of a vector potential. The main focus is on magnetic dipole interactions, and magnetic monopole interactions are not considered.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Young's experiment: Deterministic, diffractionless second-order interference effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classic Young's double-slit experiment exhibits first-order interference, producing alternating bright and dark fringes modulated by the diffraction effect of the slits. In contrast, here we demonstrate that its time-reversed configuration produces an ideal, deterministic second-order 'ghost' interference pattern devoid of diffraction and first-order effect, with the size dependent on the dimensions of the `effectively extended light source.' Furthermore, the new system enables a range of effects and phenomena not available in traditional double-slit interference studies, including the formation of programmed and digitized interference fringes and the coincidence of the pattern plane and the source plane. Despite the absence of first-order interference, our proposed experiment does not rely on nonclassical correlations or quantum entanglement. The elimination of diffraction through time-reversal symmetry holds promise for advancing superresolution optical imaging and sensing techniques beyond existing capabilities.</description>
