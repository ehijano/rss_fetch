      <title>Novikov equations for commuting differential operators of orders 3,4,5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Novikov equations for commutative ring generated by differential operators of orders 3,4,5. We present an explicit Hamiltonian form of these equations. Using the method of compatible Poisson brackets, we find a separation of variables on a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 for the Novikov equations.</description>

      <title>Exact soliton solutions and long-time asymptotics of the Yajima-Oikawa equation via Riemann-Hilbert approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yajima-Oikawa equation is a deformation of the Zakharov equation which models the propagation of ion sound waves subject to the ponderomotive force induced by high-frequency Langmuir waves. In this work, we study the exact soliton solutions and long-time asymptotics of the Yajima-Oikawa equation by Riemann-Hilbert approach. The Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated in terms of two reflection coefficients determined by the initial condition. Then exact soliton solutions associated with the Yajima-Oikawa equation are obtained based on this Riemann-Hilbert problem. Finally, the long-time asymptotics of solution to the Yajima-Oikawa equation in Zakharov-Manakov region is formulated by Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method.</description>

      <title>Integrable systems from Poisson reductions of generalized Hamiltonian torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a set of sufficient conditions for guaranteeing that an integrable system with a symmetry group $K$ on a manifold $M$ descends to an integrable system on a dense open subset of the quotient Poisson space $M/K$. The higher dimensional phase space $M$ carries a bivector $P_M$ yielding a bracket on $C^\infty(M)$ such that $C^\infty(M)^K$ is a Poisson algebra. The unreduced system on $M$ is supposed to possess `action variables' that generate a proper, effective action of a group of the form $\mathrm{U}(1)^{\ell_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{\ell_2}$ and descend to action variables of the reduced system. In view of the form of the group and since $P_M$ could be a quasi-Poisson bivector, we say that we work with a generalized Hamiltonian torus action. The reduced systems are in general superintegrable owing to the large set of invariants of the proper Hamiltonian action of $\mathrm{U}(1)^{\ell_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{\ell_2}$. We present several examples and apply our construction for solving open problems regarding the integrability of systems obtained previously by reductions of master systems on doubles of compact Lie groups: the cotangent bundle, the Heisenberg double and the quasi-Poisson double. Furthermore, we offer numerous applications to integrable systems living on moduli spaces of flat connections, using the quasi-Poisson approach.</description>

      <title>A comparative numerical study of stochastic Hamiltonian Camassa-Holm equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic perturbation of the Camassa-Holm equation such that, unlike previous formulations, energy is conserved by the stochastic flow. We compare this to a complementary approach which preserves Casimirs of the Poisson bracket. Through an energy preserving numerical implementation of the model, we study the influence of noise on the well-known 'peakon' formation behaviour of the solution. The energy conserving stochastic approach generates an ensemble of solutions which are spread around the deterministic Camassa-Holm solution, whereas the Casimir conserving alternative develops peakons which may propagate away from the deterministic solution more dramatically.</description>

      <title>$Q$-operators, $q$-opers, and R-matrices in 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantization of the moduli space of multiplicative Higgs bundles through the lens of five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in $\Omega$-background. We extend the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theoretical construction of key geometric and representation-theoretic structures, established in earlier works, to the five-dimensional uplift. We construct and analyze the $Q$-operators and $q$-opers associated with the canonical codimension-two defect: the $Q$-operators are defined via the insertion of the defect, while the $q$-opers arise as the $q$-difference chiral ring equations in its presence. The $q$-oper difference equations are further identified with the Baxter TQ equations for XXZ spin chains constructed from tensor products of bi-infinite evaluation modules over quantum affine algebras of type ${\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$. We define a $q$-difference module structure on the space of monodromy codimension-two defect partition functions and show that the eigenstates of the $Q$-operators, constructed from monodromy defects, simultaneously diagonalize the quantum Hamiltonians of the XXZ spin chain. A Fourier transformation exchanges the $Q$-operators associated with two XXZ spin chains bispectral dual to each other. Finally, we relate these constructions to the quantum cluster algebra arising from the BPS quiver of the 5d theory, and re-express the R-matrices in terms of the cluster variables.</description>

      <title>One-point functions in AdS/dCFT: MPS and twisted Yangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I focus on the scalar one-point functions in SO(6) sector of D5-D3 probe-brane set-up. Start with a general introduction of integrability, I explore both coordinate Bethe ansatz and algebraic Bethe ansatz, with possible generalization. I then shortly review how to use the Bethe ansatz in $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, and then apply such procedure to the D5-D3 system. The dual field theory of such system corresponds to a defected version of $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, where the one-point functions of certain scalars are non-zero. The calculation of one-point functions is mapped to the overlap between matrix product states and Bethe states. The matrix product states are found to be solutions of the twisted Boundary Yang-Baxter equation, and equivalently the representations of extended twisted Yangian. By dressing procedure or coproduct property, we can connect the scalar matrix product state and higher dimension matrix product states. We have used the branching rules to find the connection with some detailed parameters needed to be fixed. Such method can not only be used for calculations of one-point functions in probe-branes system, but also shed some light on non-equilibrium system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider motion of a material point placed in a constant homogeneous magnetic field restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. We provide a Lax representation of the equations of motion and prove complete integrability of those systems for any $n$. The integrability is provided via first integrals of degree one and two.</description>

      <title>Isochronous waveforms of Li\'enard equations via commutative factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isochronous waveform solutions of homogeneous Li\'enard equations are obtained by a modification of the nonlinear factorization method of Rosu and Cornejo-P\'erez.
  The scheme is based on the assumption that the intermediate function $\Phi$ that can be introduced in this factorization method depends on both
  the dependent and independent variables of the nonlinear equation. The method is applied to three cases, a noted cubic anharmonic oscillator, a Li\'enard-reduced form of the Sharma-Tasso-Olver evolution equation, and the cubic-quintic Wilson's Li\'enard equation. All these cases are written in a commutative factored form that allows to obtain the general solutions as solutions of a certain type of Bernoulli differential equation. A theorem is also given asserting the general form of the Li\'enard equation, i.e., for given polynomial degree n of its coefficients, which can be solved by this method. The conditions under which these equations can be also approached by non-local transformations are established.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy theorem separating complete integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.grability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>
