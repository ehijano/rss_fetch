      <title>How reproducible are data-driven subtypes of Alzheimer's disease atrophy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity, complicating efforts in treatment and intervention development. While new computational methods offer insights into AD progression, the reproducibility of these subtypes across datasets remains understudied, particularly concerning the robustness of subtype definitions when validated on diverse databases. This study evaluates the consistency of AD progression subtypes identified by the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) algorithm using T1-weighted MRI data across 5,444 subjects from ANMerge, OASIS, and ADNI datasets, forming four independent cohorts. Each cohort was analyzed under two conditions: one using the full cohort, including cognitively normal controls, and another excluding controls to test subtype robustness. Results confirm the three primary atrophy subtypes identified in earlier studies: Typical, Cortical, and Subcortical, as well as the emergence of rare and atypical AD variants such as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). Notably, each subtype displayed varying robustness to the inclusion of controls, with certain subtypes, like Subcortical, more influenced by cohort composition. This investigation underscores SuStaIn's reliability for defining stable AD subtypes and suggests its utility in clinical stratification for trials and diagnosis. However, our findings also highlight the need for improved dataset diversity, particularly in terms of ethnic representation, to enhance generalizability and support broader clinical application.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Indicators of Adherence and Retention in Digital Health Studies: Insights from the Brighten Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Effective use of mobile health technologies requires high participant adherence and retention. However, remote digital health studies often face high attrition and low adherence, potentially introducing bias and limiting generalizability. Objective: This study aims to identify longitudinal indicators of participant retention and adherence to develop strategies for improving data collection in digital health studies and understanding how cohorts are shaped by participant withdrawal and non-adherence. Methods: We conducted analyses on the Brighten study, a smartphone-based randomized controlled trial evaluating apps for depression treatment. Participants were asked to complete seven digital questionnaires regularly. Outcomes included adherence (questionnaire completion), engagement (post-baseline participation), and retention (continued participation over time). We analyzed relationships between these outcomes, static factors (e.g., demographics, average questionnaire scores) and dynamic factors (e.g., questionnaire score changes over time). Results: Of 2,201 participants, 1,093 completed at least one non-baseline questionnaire (median completion rate: 37.6%). Adherence was higher among participants with lower average depression severity (P&lt;.001) and those perceiving improvement (P=.001). Demographic factors significantly influenced adherence and engagement. Participants with greater baseline depressive symptoms were more likely to withdraw before completing non-baseline questionnaires (t=-2.53, P=.01). However, symptom improvement was linked to better adherence (U=127,084; P&lt;.001) and retention (HR=0.78, P=.002). Conclusion: Clinical trajectories and perceived improvements in depressive symptoms are key indicators of engagement, adherence, and retention. These findings may enhance data interpretation and inform strategies to boost retention and adherence in future trials.</description>

      <title>pasta: Pattern Analysis for Spatial Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial omics assays allow for the molecular characterisation of cells in their spatial context. Notably, the two main technological streams, imaging-based and high-throughput sequencing-based, can give rise to very different data modalities. The characteristics of the two data types are well known in adjacent fields such as spatial statistics as point patterns and lattice data, and there is a wide range of tools available. This paper discusses the application of spatial statistics to spatially-resolved omics data and in particular, discusses various advantages, challenges, and nuances. This work is accompanied by a vignette, pasta, that showcases the usefulness of spatial statistics in biology using several R packages.</description>

      <title>Spatial Clustering of Molecular Localizations with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule localization microscopy generates point clouds corresponding to fluorophore localizations. Spatial cluster identification and analysis of these point clouds are crucial for extracting insights about molecular organization. However, this task becomes challenging in the presence of localization noise, high point density, or complex biological structures. Here, we introduce MIRO (Multimodal Integration through Relational Optimization), an algorithm that uses recurrent graph neural networks to transform the point clouds in order to improve clustering efficiency when applying conventional clustering techniques. We show that MIRO supports simultaneous processing of clusters of different shapes and at multiple scales, demonstrating improved performance across varied datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates MIRO's transformative potential for single-molecule localization applications, showcasing its capability to revolutionize cluster analysis and provide accurate, reliable details of molecular architecture. In addition, MIRO's robust clustering capabilities hold promise for applications in various fields such as neuroscience, for the analysis of neural connectivity patterns, and environmental science, for studying spatial distributions of ecological data.</description>

      <title>Generative Model for Synthesizing Ionizable Lipids: A Monte Carlo Tree Search Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionizable lipids are essential in developing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for effective messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery. While traditional methods for designing new ionizable lipids are typically time-consuming, deep generative models have emerged as a powerful solution, significantly accelerating the molecular discovery process. However, a practical challenge arises as the molecular structures generated can often be difficult or infeasible to synthesize. This project explores Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based generative models for synthesizable ionizable lipids. Leveraging a synthetically accessible lipid building block dataset and two specialized predictors to guide the search through chemical space, we introduce a policy network guided MCTS generative model capable of producing new ionizable lipids with available synthesis pathways.</description>

      <title>CellSeg1: Robust Cell Segmentation with One Training Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent trends in cell segmentation have shifted towards universal models to handle diverse cell morphologies and imaging modalities. However, for continuously emerging cell types and imaging techniques, these models still require hundreds or thousands of annotated cells for fine-tuning. We introduce CellSeg1, a practical solution for segmenting cells of arbitrary morphology and modality with a few dozen cell annotations in 1 image. By adopting Low-Rank Adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), we achieve robust cell segmentation. Tested on 19 diverse cell datasets, CellSeg1 trained on 1 image achieved 0.81 average mAP at 0.5 IoU, performing comparably to existing models trained on over 500 images. It also demonstrated superior generalization in cross-dataset tests on TissueNet. We found that high-quality annotation of a few dozen densely packed cells of varied sizes is key to effective segmentation. CellSeg1 provides an efficient solution for cell segmentation with minimal annotation effort.</description>

      <title>A Novel Use of Pseudospectra in Mathematical Biology: Understanding HPA Axis Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis is a major neuroendocrine system, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases. This system also presents interesting mathematical challenges for modeling. We consider a nonlinear delay differential equation model and calculate pseudospectra of three different linearizations: a time-dependent Jacobian, linearization around the limit cycle, and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) analysis of Koopman operators (global linearization). The time-dependent Jacobian provided insight into experimental phenomena, explaining why rats respond differently to perturbations during corticosterone secretion's upward versus downward slopes. We developed new mathematical techniques for the other two linearizations to calculate pseudospectra on Banach spaces and apply DMD to delay differential equations, respectively. These methods helped establish local and global limit cycle stability and study transients. Additionally, we discuss using pseudospectra to substantiate the model in experimental contexts and establish bio-variability via data-driven methods. This work is the first to utilize pseudospectra to explore the HPA axis.</description>
