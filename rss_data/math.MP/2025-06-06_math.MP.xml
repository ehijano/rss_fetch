      <title>A New $q$-Heisenberg Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel $q$-$\hbar$ deformation of the Heisenberg algebra, designed to unify and extend several existing $q$-deformed formulations. Starting from the canonical Heisenberg algebra defined by the commutation relation $[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar$ on a Hilbert space \cite{Zettili2009}, we survey a variety of $q$-deformed structures previously proposed by Wess \cite{Wess2000}, Schm\"udgen \cite{Schmudgen1999}, Wess--Schwenk \cite{Wess-Schwenk1992}, Gaddis \cite{Jasson-Gaddis2016}, and others. These frameworks involve position, momentum, and auxiliary operators that satisfy nontrivial commutation rules and algebraic relations incorporating deformation parameters. Our new $q$-$\hbar$ Heisenberg algebra $\mathcal{H}_q$ is generated by elements $\hat{x}_\alpha$, $\hat{y}_\lambda$, and $\hat{p}_\beta$ with $\alpha, \lambda, \beta \in \{1,2,3\}$, and is defined through generalized commutation relations parameterized by real constants $n, m, l$ and three dynamical functions $\Psi(q)$, $\Phi(q)$, and $\Pi(q)$ depending on the deformation parameter $q$ and the generators. By selecting appropriate values for these parameters and functions, our framework recovers several well-known algebras as special cases, including the classical Heisenberg algebra for $q = 1$ and $\Psi = 1$, $\Phi = \Pi = 0$, and various $q$-deformed algebras for $q \neq 1$. The algebraic consistency of these generalizations is demonstrated through a series of explicit examples, and the resulting structures are shown to align with quantum planes \cite{Yuri-Manin2010} and enveloping algebras associated with Lie algebra homomorphisms \cite{Reyes2014a}. This construction offers a flexible and unified formalism for studying quantum deformations, with potential applications in quantum mechanics, noncommutative geometry, and quantum group theory.</description>

      <title>Conformal nets from minimal W-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the strong graded locality of all unitary minimal W-algebras, so that they give rise to irreducible graded-local conformal nets. Among these unitary vertex superalgebras, up to taking tensor products with free fermion vertex superalgebras, there are the unitary Virasoro vertex algebras (N=0) and the unitary N=1,2,3,4 super-Virasoro vertex superalgebras. Accordingly, we have a uniform construction that gives, besides the already known N=0,1,2 super-Virasoro nets, also the new N=3,4 super-Virasoro nets. All strongly rational unitary minimal W-algebras give rise to previously known completely rational graded-local conformal nets and we conjecture that the converse is also true. We prove this conjecture for all unitary W-algebras corresponding to the N=0,1,2,3,4 super-Virasoro vertex superalgebras.</description>

      <title>On the analytical approach to infinite-mode Boson-Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analytical approach to quantum Gaussian states in infinite-mode representation of the Canonical Commutation Relations (CCR's), using Yosida approximations to define integrability of possibly unbounded observables with respect to a state $\rho$ ($\rho$-integrability). It turns out that all elements of the commutative $*$-algebra generated by a possibly unbounded $\rho$-integrable observable $A$, denoted by $\langle A\rangle$, are normal and $\rho \, $-integrable. Besides, $\langle A\rangle$ can be endowed with the well-defined norm $\|\cdot\|_\rho:= {\rm tr}\,(\rho |\cdot| )$. Our approach allows us to rigorously establish fundamental properties and derive key formulae for the mean value vector and the covariance operator. We additionally show that the covariance operator $S$ of any Gaussian state is real, bounded, positive, and invertible, with the property that $S-iJ\geq 0$, being $J$ the multiplication operator by $-i$ on $\ell_2({\mathbb N})$.</description>

      <title>Is Crane--Yetter fully extended?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the question of whether the Crane-Yetter topological quantum field theory (TQFT) associated to a modular tensor category admits a fully extended refinement. More specifically, we use tools from stable homotopy theory to classify extensions of invertible four-dimensional TQFTs to theories valued in symmetric monoidal 4-categories whose Picard spectrum has nontrivial homotopy only in degrees 0 and 4. We show that such extensions are classified by two pieces of data: an equivalence class of an invertible object in the target and a sixth root of unity. Applying this result to the 4-category $\mathbf{BrFus}$ of braided fusion categories, we find that there are infinitely many equivalence classes of fully extended invertible TQFTs reproducing the Crane-Yetter partition function on top-dimensional manifolds, parametrized by a $\mathbb{Z}/6$-extension of the Witt group of nondegenerate braided fusion categories.
  This analysis clarifies common claims in the literature and raises the question of how to naturally pick out the $SO(4)$-fixed point data on the framed TQFT which assigns the input braided fusion category to the point so that it selects the Crane-Yetter state-sum.</description>

      <title>Very high-order accurate finite volume scheme for the streamfunction-vorticity formulation of incompressible fluid flows with polygonal meshes on arbitrary curved boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional mathematical models for simulating incompressible fluid flow problems are based on the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in terms of pressure and velocity. In this context, pressure-velocity coupling is a key issue, and countless numerical techniques and methods have been developed over the decades to solve these equations efficiently and accurately. In two dimensions, an alternative approach is to rewrite the Navier-Stokes equations regarding two scalar quantities: the streamfunction and the vorticity. Compared to the primitive variables approach, this formulation does not require pressure to be computed, thereby avoiding the inherent difficulties associated with the pressure-velocity coupling. However, deriving boundary conditions for the streamfunction and vorticity is challenging. This work proposes an efficient, high-order accurate finite-volume discretisation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the streamfunction-vorticity formulation. A detailed discussion is devoted to deriving the appropriate boundary conditions and their numerical treatment, including on arbitrary curved boundaries. The reconstruction for off-site data method is employed to avoid the difficulties associated with generating curved meshes to preserve high-orders of convergence in arbitrary curved domains, such as sophisticated meshing algorithms, cumbersome quadrature rules, and intricate non-linear transformations. This method approximates arbitrary curved boundaries with a conventional linear piecewise approximation, while constrained polynomial reconstructions near the boundary fulfil the prescribed conditions at the physical boundary. Several incompressible fluid flow test cases in non-trivial 2D curved domains are presented and discussed to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methodology in achieving very high orders of convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heisenberg-Weyl operators provide a Hermitian generalization of Pauli operators in higher dimensions. Positive maps arising from Heisenberg-Weyl operators have been studied along with several algebraic and spectral properties of Heisenberg-Weyl observables. This allows to generalize the study of Pauli type maps in higher dimesional algebra of operators.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetism: an intrinsic approach to Hadamard's method of descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic geometric framework for the dimensional reduction of classical electromagnetism based on the concept of descent along vector fields of invariance. By exploring the interplay between the Lie derivative and the Hodge star operator, we implement descent conditions on differential forms that reduce Maxwell's equations in four-dimensional spacetime to electromagnetic theories in lower dimensions. We also consider multiple descent along pairwise commuting vector fields of invariance, yielding a finer decomposition of Maxwell's equations. Our results provide a unified and geometrically transparent interpretation of dimensional reduction, with potential applications to field theories in lower-dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On the Physics of Higher Condensation Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of topological defects for finite Abelian symmetries in quantum field theories, and argue on physical grounds that they satisfy the definition of a higher fusion category proposed by Johnson-Freyd. Our primary focus is on the requirement of Karoubi completeness, i.e. the factorization conditions on higher condensation defects. We demonstrate this on a tree of such defects, constructed by successive higher gauging, explicitly using Lagrangian techniques in a concrete four-dimensional example, before turning to more general field theories. Along the way we also comment on the phenomenon where decoupled topological field theories appear as fusion coefficients. We further discuss the categorical role of anomalies, and how they may affect the properties of (higher) condensation defects.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate determinants of random unitary pencils (with scalar or matrix coefficients), which generalize the characteristic polynomial of a single unitary matrix. In particular we examine moments of such determinants, obtained by integrating against the Haar measure on the unitary group. We obtain an exact formula in the case of scalar coefficients, and conjecture an asymptotic formula in the general case, and prove a special case of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Rigorous theory of coupled resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the general failure of the famous concept of tight binding and mode hybridization underlying modern theories of coupled open resonators. In spite of sophisticated examples in the literature, successfully illustrating these theories, the latter fail to describe any planar systems. This includes the simplest possible case of two dielectric slabs placed next to each other or separated by a distance, which is straightforward for verification, due to its analytical solvability. We present a rigorous theory capable of calculating correctly the eigenmodes of arbitrary three-dimensional dispersive coupled resonators in terms of their individual modes, providing insight into the proper mode hybridization and formation of bonding and antibonding supermodes. Planar optical resonators, such as coupled slabs and Bragg-mirror microcavities, are used for illustrative purposes as they allow precise and reliable verification of the theory.</description>

      <title>A phase transition in the Bakry-\'Emery gradient estimate for Dyson Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find a gap between the lower bound of the Bakry-\'Emery $N$-Ricci tensor ${\rm Ric}_N$ and the Bakry-\'Emery gradient estimate ${\sf BE}$ in the space associated with the finite-particle Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) with inverse temperature $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$. Namely, we prove that, for the weighted space $(\mathbb R^n, w_\beta)$ with $w_\beta=\prod_{i&lt;j}^n |x_i-x_j|^\beta$ and any $N\in[n+\frac{\beta}{2}n(n-1),+\infty]$,
  $\beta \ge 1 \implies {\rm Ric}_N \ge 0 \ \&amp; \ {\sf BE}(0,N)$ hold;
  $0 &lt; \beta &lt; 1 \implies {\rm Ric}_N \ge 0$ holds while ${\sf BE}(0,N)$ does not, which shows a phase transition of the Dyson Brownian motion regarding the Bakry-\'Emery curvature bound in the small inverse temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial features of asymptotic freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates for the emergence of free probability behavior. Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of state communication in finite-level quantum systems through noise-affected channels. Our approach is based on a self-consistent theory of decoding inner products associated with the code and error (or noise) bases defined on corrupting subspaces. This viewpoint yields new necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of quantum error-correcting codes in terms of these inner products. The obtained results extend the foundations of quantum error correction beyond classical analogies, highlighting the structural insights offered by operator theory and the underlying product space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a rigorous characterization of inner products on the Hilbert space $S_2$ of Hilbert--Schmidt operators. We first deal with a general setting of continuous sesquilinear forms on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$, and provide a characterization of all inner products by means of positive operators in $\mathcal {B(H)}$. Next, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for an operator in $\mathcal B(S_2)$ to be positive. Identifying an inner product with a positive operator enables us to rigorously describe inner products on $S_2$.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum trace-free Einstein cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trace-free Einstein gravity, in the absence of matter fields and using the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, is solvable both classically and quantum mechanically. This is achieved by using the conformal time as the time variable and the negative or positive of the inverse of the scale factor as configuration variable to write the classical equation of motion, which turns out to be the one of a free particle ($k=0$), a harmonic oscillator ($k=1$), and a repulsive oscillator ($k=-1$) in the real half-line. In all cases, the observable identified as the cosmological constant is six times the Hamiltonian. In particular, for a closed Universe ($k=1$), spacetime exhibits a cyclic evolution along which the scalar curvature is constant and finite, thereby avoiding singularities. The quantum theory is reached by using canonical quantization. We calculate the spectrum of the observable corresponding to the cosmological constant. Remarkably, for the closed Universe ($k=1$), the spectrum is discrete and positive while for flat ($k=0$) and open ($k=-1$) universes, the spectra are continuous. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle imposes limitations on the simultaneous measurement of the Hubble expansion (momentum variable) and the configuration variable. We also report the observable identified as the cosmological constant for inflaton, phantom and perfect fluids coupled to trace-free Einstein gravity in the FRW metric.</description>

      <title>New exact solutions of the 3D Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously we found a unique quantum system with a positive gauge-invariant Weyl-Stratonovich quasi-probability density function which can be defined by the so-called {\guillemotleft}quadratic funnel{\guillemotright} potential [Phys. Rev. A 110 02222 (2024)]. In this work we have constructed a class of exact solutions to the 3D Schr\"odinger equation for a two-parameter {\guillemotleft}quadratic funnel{\guillemotright} potential based on the -model of micro and macro systems. Explicit expressions for the energy spectrum and the set of eigenfunctions have been found. Using gauge invariance for scalar and vector potentials, a solution to the electromagnetic Schr\"odinger equation has been obtained, with a magnetic field in the form of a {\guillemotleft}Dirac string{\guillemotright} defined by a singular vortex probability flux field. Superpositions of eigenfunctions leading to various types of vortex and potential probability current fields have been investigated in detail. The analysis of the quantum system's properties has been carried out within the Wigner-Vlasov formalism.</description>

      <title>Midplane based 3D single pass unbiased segment-to-segment contact interaction using penalty method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a contact interaction methodology for an unbiased treatment of contacting surfaces without assigning surfaces as master and slave. The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are evaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining the equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of true interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their integral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A meticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of interacting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better traction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch test, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the capability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and sharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch test with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy levels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with mesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested for self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material. Dynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as oblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the algorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces for nonconformal meshes with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility in general contact problems.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of synthetic null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a synthetic framework for the geometric and analytic study of null (lightlike) hypersurfaces in non-smooth spacetimes. Drawing from optimal transport and recent advances in Lorentzian geometry and causality theory, we define a synthetic null hypersurface as a triple $(H, G, \mathfrak{m})$: $H$ is a closed achronal set in a topological causal space, $G$ is a gauge function encoding affine parametrizations along null generators, and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a Radon measure serving as a synthetic analog of the rigged measure. This generalizes classical differential geometric structures to potentially singular spacetimes.
  A central object is the synthetic null energy condition ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$), defined via the concavity of an entropy power functional along optimal transport, with parametrization given by the gauge $G$. This condition is invariant under changes of gauge and measure within natural equivalence classes. It agrees with the classical Null Energy Condition in the smooth setting and it applies to low-regularity spacetimes. A key property of $\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$ is the stability under convergence of synthetic null hypersurfaces, inspired by measured Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
  As a first application, we obtain a synthetic version of Hawking's area theorem. Moreover, we obtain various sharpenings of the celebrated Penrose's singularity theorem: for smooth spacetimes we show that the incomplete null geodesic whose existence is guaranteed by Penrose's argument is actually maximizing; we extend Penrose's singularity theorem to continuous spacetimes; we prove the existence of trapped regions in the general setting of topological causal spaces satisfying the synthetic $\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new method to calculate the full microlocal description of singularities of Feynman integrals. This is done by associating a unique constructible function to the system of partial differential equations (PDEs) annihilating the integral and from this function the singularities can directly be read-off. This function can be constructed explicitly even if the system of PDEs is unknown and describes both the location of the singularities and the number of master integrals on them. Our framework is flexible enough to preform the calculation in any of the Lee-Pomeransky, Feynman, or momentum representations.</description>

Abstract: We present static axially symmetric fluid distributions not producing gravitational field outside their boundaries (i.e. fluid sources which match smoothly on the boundary surface to Minkowski space-time). These solutions provide further examples of ghost stars. A specific model is fully described, and its physical and geometrical properties are analyzed in detail. This includes the multipole moment structure of the source and its complexity factors, both of which vanish for our solution.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a technique to construct gapped lattice models using defects in topological field theory. We illustrate with 2+1 dimensional models, for example Chern-Simons theories. These models are local, though the state space is not necessarily a tensor product of vector spaces over the complex numbers. The Hamiltonian is a sum of commuting projections. We also give a topological field theory construction of Levin-Wen models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a resolvent problem arising from the $Q$-tensor model for liquid crystal flows in the half-space. Our purpose is to show the $\mathcal{R}$-boundedness for the solution operator families of the resolvent problem when the resolvent parameter lies near the origin. The definition of the $\mathcal{R}$-solvability implies the uniform boundedness of the operator and, consequently, the resolvent estimates for the linear system.</description>

      <title>Myopic non-intersection in a periodic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of Markov processes conditioned to avoid intersection over a moving time window of length T&gt;0, a setting we refer to as myopic non-intersection. In particular, we study a system of myopic non-intersecting Brownian motions subject to a periodic potential. Our focus lies in understanding the interplay between the confining effect of the potential and the repulsion induced by the non-intersection constraint. We show that, in the long time limit, and as both T and the strength of the potential become large, the model converges to a system of myopic non-intersecting random walks, which transitions between standard non-intersection dynamics and exclusion behavior. The main technical contribution of the paper is the introduction of an algorithm, based on a modification of the acceptance-rejection sampling scheme, that provides an explicit construction of myopically constrained systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charge fluctuations of a family of stochastic charged cellular automata away from the deterministic single-file limit and obtain the exact typical charge probability distributions, known to be anomalous, using hydrodynamics. The cellular automata considered are examples of linearly degenerate systems where two distinct mechanisms of diffusion, namely normal and convective diffusion, coexist. Our formalism, based on macroscopic fluctuation theory, allows us to describe current fluctuations stemming from these two diffusive processes, and we expect it to be applicable to generic linearly degenerate systems. The derived probability distributions match the exact microscopic result and numerical simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many-body systems, the dynamics is governed, at large scales of space and time, by the hydrodynamic principle of projection onto the conserved densities admitted by the model. This is formalised as local relaxation of fluctuations in the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, a nonlinear Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. We use it to derive a projection formula, expressing n-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic observables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved densities. This applies in every d &gt;= 1 spatial dimensions and under the ballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium. It generalises the well-known linear-response principle for 2-point functions. For higher-point functions, one needs to account for nonlinear fluctuations of conserved densities. The result is a nonlinear projection, expressed as a sum over certain products of lower-order correlation functions of conserved densities with equilibrium multivariances as coefficients. Using Malyshev's formula, the sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the set of space-time points, which we call "minimal connected covers". We use this in order to get general, explicit formulas for two- and three-point functions in stationary states, expressed in terms of thermodynamic and Euler-scale data.</description>

Abstract: The mean evolution of an open quantum system in continuous time is described by a time continuous semigroup of quantum channels (completely positive and trace-preserving linear maps). Baumgartner and Narnhofer presented a general decomposition of the underlying Hilbert space into a sum of invariant subspaces, also called enclosures. We propose a new reading of this result, inspired by the work of Carbone and Pautrat. In addition, we apply this decomposition to a class of open quantum random walks and to quantum trajectories, where we study its uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic noise in one dimension: projected Kubo formula and its vanishing in integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic noise is the Gaussian process that emerges at larges scales of space and time in many-body systems. It arises by the central limit theorem applied to local microcanonical averages, representing the degrees of freedom that have been forgotten when projecting coarse-grained observables onto conserved quantities. It comes with "bare" diffusion terms. In one dimension of space, nonlinearities of the hydrodynamic equation are relevant (from a renormalisation perspective), usually giving rise to hydrodynamic superdiffusion. But in linearly degenerate systems, where the relevant nonlinearity vanishes, the diffusive scaling stays intact. Nevertheless, anomalies remain. We show that in such systems, the noise covariance is determined in terms of a modification of the Kubo formula, where effects of ballistic long-range correlations have been subtracted. This is the projected Onsager matrix, in which so-called quadratic charges are projected out. We show that the Einstein relation holds, giving a projected bare diffusion, and that the remaining nonlinearities are tamed by a point-splitting regularisation. Putting these ingredients together, we obtain an exact and well-defined hydrodynamic fluctuation theory in the ballistic scaling of space-time, for the asymptotic expansion in the inverse variation scale, including the first subleading (diffusive-scale) corrections beyond large deviations. This is expressed as a stochastic PDE. We then obtain the anomalous hydrodynamic equation, which takes into account separately long-range correlations and bare diffusion. Using these result, in integrable systems, we show that hydrodynamic noise must be absent, as was conjectured recently.</description>

      <title>Erasure cost of a quantum process: A thermodynamic meaning of the dynamical min-entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The erasure of information is fundamentally an irreversible logical operation, carrying profound consequences for the energetics of computation and information processing. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic costs associated with erasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we analyze an arbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary input-output systems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the ground state. We focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced dynamics~\textemdash~that is, the minimal thermodynamic work required to erase the logical output of the gate for any logical input, assuming full access to the ancilla but no access to any purifying reference of the logical input state. We determine that this adversarial erasure cost is directly proportional to the negative min-entropy of the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the dynamical min-entropy a clear operational meaning. A key foundation of this result is the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates the decoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges thermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</description>

      <title>A 2D-CFT Factory: Critical Lattice Models from Competing Anyon Condensation Processes in SymTO/SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a ``CFT factory'' : a novel algorithm of methodically generating 2D lattice models that would flow to 2D conformal fixed points in the infrared. These 2D models are realised by giving critical boundary conditions to 3D topological orders (symTOs/symTFTs) described by string-net models, often called the strange correlators. We engineer these critical boundary conditions by introducing a commensurate amount of non-commuting anyon condensates. The non-invertible symmetries preserved at the critical point can be controlled by studying a novel ``refined condensation tree''. Our structured method generates an infinite family of critical lattice models, including the A-series minimal models, and uncovers previously unknown critical points. Notably, we find at least three novel critical points (c$\approx 1.3$, $1.8$, and $2.5$ respectively) preserving the Haagerup symmetries, in addition to recovering previously reported ones. The condensation tree, together with a generalised Kramers-Wannier duality, predicts precisely large swathes of phase boundaries, fixes almost completely the global phase diagram, and sieves out second order phase transitions. This is not only illustrated in well-known examples (such as the 8-vertex model related to the $A_5$ category) but also further verified with precision numerics, using our improved (non-invertible) symmetry-preserving tensor-network RG, in novel examples involving the Haagerup symmetries. We show that critical couplings can be precisely encoded in the categorical data (Frobenius algebras and quantum dimensions in unitary fusion categories), thus establishing a powerful, systematic route to discovering and potentially classifying new conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Deriving a GENERIC system from a Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider the fundamental problem of coarse-graining infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics to obtain a macroscopic system which includes dissipative mechanisms. In particular, we study the thermodynamical implications concerning Hamiltonians, energy, and entropy and the induced geometric structures such as Poisson and Onsager brackets (symplectic and dissipative brackets).
  We start from a general finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system that is coupled linearly to an infinite-dimensional heat bath with linear dynamics. The latter is assumed to admit a compression to a finite-dimensional dissipative semigroup (i.e., the heat bath is a dilation of the semigroup) describing the dissipative evolution of new macroscopic variables.
  Already in the finite-energy case (zero-temperature heat bath) we obtain the so-called GENERIC structure (General Equations for Non-Equilibrium Reversible Irreversibe Coupling), with conserved energy, nondecreasing entropy, a new Poisson structure, and an Onsager operator describing the dissipation. However, their origin is not obvious at this stage. After extending the system in a natural way to the case of positive temperature, giving a heat bath with infinite energy, the compression property leads to an exact multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that drives the rest of the system. Thus, we are able to identify a conserved energy, an entropy, and an Onsager operator (involving the Green-Kubo formalism) which indeed provide a GENERIC structure for the macroscopic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the beta function in the functorial formulation of two-dimensional quantum field theories (FQFT). A key feature of this approach is the absence of ultraviolet divergences. We show that, nevertheless, in the FQFT perturbation theory, the local observables of deformed theories acquire logarithmic dimension, leading to a conformal anomaly. The beta function arises in the functorial approach as an infinitesimal transformation of the partition function under the variation of the metric's conformal factor, without ultraviolet divergences, UV cutoff, or the traditional renormalization procedure.</description>

      <title>Variational formulations of transport on combinatorial meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop analogues of the primal and mixed variational formulations of the conservation laws describing transport of scalar physical properties for topological spaces referred to as cell complexes. The development is restricted to cell complexes with cells having connectivity of simple polytopes. Such spaces are suitable representations of physical systems composed of elements of different apparent topological dimensions, where all elements might have individual properties, and elements of a given dimension might interact via common elements of lower dimensions. This modelling foundation can be considered as intermediate between the foundation for particle-based modelling, which is the discrete topology, and the foundation for continuum modelling, which is the smooth topology. The new foundation offers advantages for the analysis of the behaviour of physical systems with complex internal structures. The development is based on a calculus with combinatorial differential forms which is a discrete analogue of the smooth exterior calculus with differential forms. We call the resulting calculus combinatorial mesh calculus (CMC) as it is based on combinatorial meshes, for which embedding is forgotten and only the connectivity between cells and measures of the cells are used in calculations. We discuss how the obtained formulation is specialised for several different problems, including mass diffusion, heat conduction, fluid flow in porous media, and charge diffusion, and provide details about the formulation of initial boundary value problems for these transport cases. Examples and results for selected boundary value problems are given to demonstrate the capabilities of the CMC formulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the construction of approximations of the propagator associated with a semi-classical matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operator with symbol presenting smooth eigenvalues crossings. Inspired by the approach of the theoretical chemists Herman and Kluk who propagated continuous superpositions of Gaussian wave-packets for scalar equations, we consider frozen and thawed Gaussian initial value representations that incorporate classical transport and branching processes along a hopping hypersurface. Based on the Gaussian wave-packet framework, our result relies on an accurate analysis of the solutions of the associated Schr\"odinger equation for data that are vector-valued wave-packets. We prove that these solutions are asymptotic to wavepackets at any order in terms of the semi-classical parameter.</description>

      <title>Complex crystallographic reflection groups and Seiberg-Witten integrable systems: rank 1 case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generalisations of the elliptic Calogero--Moser systems associated to complex crystallographic groups in accordance to [1]. In our previous work [2], we proposed these systems as candidates for Seiberg--Witten integrable systems of certain SCFTs. Here we examine that proposal for complex crystallographic groups of rank one. Geometrically, this means considering elliptic curves $T^2$ with $\mathbb{Z}_m$-symmetries, $m=2,3,4,6$, and Poisson deformations of the orbifolds $(T^2\times\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{Z}_m$. The $m=2$ case was studied in [2], while $m=3,4,6$ correspond to Seiberg--Witten integrable systems for the rank 1 Minahan--Nemeshansky SCFTs of type $E_{6,7,8}$. This allows us to describe the corresponding elliptic fibrations and the Seiberg--Witten differential in a compact elegant form. This approach also produces quantum spectral curves for these SCFTs, which are given by Fuchsian ODEs with special properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the vector field associated to the GKLS generator for systems described by Gaussian states. This vector field is defined on the dual space of the algebra of operators, restricted to operators quadratic in position and momentum. It is shown that the GKLS dynamics accepts a decomposition principle, that is, this vector field can be decomposed in three parts, a conservative Hamiltonian component, a gradient-like, and a Choi-Kraus or jump vector field. The two last terms are considered a "perturbation" associated with dissipation. Examples are presented for a harmonic oscillator with different dissipation terms.</description>

      <title>Weak Generative Sampler to Efficiently Sample Invariant Distribution of Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling invariant distributions from an It\^o diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in biased and correlated samples. The current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in the form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from a base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for min-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Our method necessitates neither the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centers related to the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.</description>

      <title>On the refined analyticity radius of 3-D generalized Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the instantaneous growth of analyticity radius for three dimensional generalized Navier-Stokes equations. For the subcritical $H^{\gamma}(\mathbb R^3)$ case with $\gamma&gt;\frac12,$ we prove that there exists a positive time $t_0$ so that for any $t\in]0, t_0]$, the radius of analyticity of the solution $u$ satisfies the pointwise-in-time lower bound $${\mathrm{rad}}(u)(t)\ge \sqrt{(2\gamma-1)t\bigl(|\ln t|+\ln|\ln t|+K_t\bigr)},$$ where $K_t \to \infty$ as $t\to 0^+$. This in particular gives a nontrivial improvement of the previous result by Herbst and Skibsted in \cite{HS} for the case $\gamma\in ]1/2,3/2[$ and also settles the decade-long open question in \cite{HS}, namely, whether or not
  $\liminf_{t\to 0^+}\frac {{\mathrm{ rad}}(u)(t)}{\sqrt{t|\ln t|}}\ge \sqrt{2\gamma-1}$ for all $\gamma\ge \frac32$. For the critical case $H^{\frac 12}(\mathbb R^3)$, we prove that there exists $t_1&gt;0$ so that for any $t\in ]0, t_1],$ ${\mathrm {rad}}(u)(t)\ge \lambda(t)\sqrt{t}$ with $\lambda(t)$ satisfying $\lim_{t\to 0^+}\lambda(t)=\infty.$</description>

Abstract: The Sadovskii vortex patch is a traveling wave for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations consisting of an odd symmetric pair of vortex patches touching the symmetry axis. Its existence was first suggested by numerical computations of Sadovskii in [J. Appl. Math. Mech., 1971], and has gained significant interest due to its relevance in inviscid limit of planar flows via Prandtl--Batchelor theory and as the asymptotic state for vortex ring dynamics. In this work, we prove the existence of a Sadovskii vortex patch, by solving the energy maximization problem under the exact impulse condition and an upper bound on the circulation.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the standard gradient flow in parameter space that underlies many training algorithms in deep learning can be continuously deformed into an adapted gradient flow which yields (constrained) Euclidean gradient flow in output space. Moreover, for the $L^{2}$ loss, if the Jacobian of the outputs with respect to the parameters is full rank (for fixed training data), then the time variable can be reparametrized so that the resulting flow is simply linear interpolation, and a global minimum can be achieved. For the cross-entropy loss, under the same rank condition and assuming the labels have positive components, we derive an explicit formula for the unique global minimum.</description>

      <title>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to generate classical moments from the correlation function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 \equiv \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit.</description>

      <title>Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of recent progress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N&gt;2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</description>

      <title>Analysis of pitchfork bifurcations and symmetry breaking in the elliptic restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unified framework is proposed to quantitatively characterize pitchfork bifurcations and associated symmetry breaking in the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP). It is known that planar/vertical Lyapunov orbits and Lissajous orbits near the collinear libration points undergo pitchfork bifurcations with varying orbital energy. These bifurcations induce symmetry breaking, generating bifurcated families including halo/quasi-halo orbits, axial/quasi-axial orbits, and their corresponding invariant manifolds. Traditional semi-analytical methods for constructing halo orbits, based on resonant bifurcation mechanisms, have obstacles in fully exploiting the intrinsic symmetry breaking characteristics in pitchfork bifurcations. In this paper, a unified trigonometric series-based framework is proposed to analyze these bifurcated families from the perspective of coupling-induced bifurcation mechanisms. By introducing a coupling coefficient and various bifurcation equations into the ERTBP, different symmetry breaking is achieved when the coupling coefficient is non-zero. This unified semi-analytical framework captures bifurcations of both periodic/quasi-periodic and transit/non-transit orbits. Furthermore, it reveals that pitchfork bifurcation solutions in the ERTBP fundamentally depend solely on the orbital eccentricity and three amplitude parameters of the system's degrees of freedom, governing both the elliptic direction and the hyperbolic one.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for general convolution approximations to a large class of log-correlated Gaussian fields, the properly normalised supercritical Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures converge stably to a nontrivial limit. This limit depends on the choice of regularisation only through a multiplicative constant and can be characterised as an integrated atomic measure with a random intensity expressed in terms of the critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos.</description>

      <title>A Warm-start QAOA based approach using a swap-based mixer for the TSP: theoretical considerations,implementation and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum heuristics based on Mixer Hamiltonians, which allow the search to be restricted to a specific subspace and enable warm-start strategies for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Approaches involving Mixer Hamiltonians can be integrated into the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), where the Mixer acts as a mapping function that transforms qubit strings into feasible solution sets. We first introduce a swap-based mixer tailored to the TSP, which ensures that only qubit strings representing valid TSP solutions are explored during the QAOA process. Second, we propose a warm-start technique that initializes QAOA with a solution generated by any classical heuristic, thereby promoting faster convergence. These two contributions are combined into a Warm-Start QAOA framework with a Swap-Based Mixer, leveraging both structural and initialization advantages. Experimental results on a custom TSP instance involving five customers demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, providing, for the first time, a viable integration of warm-start and swap-based mixers for the TSP within a quantum optimization framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation with smooth but otherwise unconstrained initial conditions are constructed, to solve the Millennium fluids problem in the positive. The smooth solutions are the mean values of general weak solutions and are alternately characterized as the entropy production minimizing solutions. The construction occurs in a finite periodic cube.</description>

      <title>LSZ ghostbusters in the quadratic gravity stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided in order to give positive probabilities. These authors also postulate a candidate for a path integral for those theories, following pioneer works initiated by Dirac [10]} and Pauli \[11]. However, taking into account the non standard oscillator algebra inherent to this method, It is of interest the derivation of the LSZ rules in this context, since it may not be clear at first sight that has the usual form of the textbooks, due to the non standard oscillator algebra and the redefinitions of the states.This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit. As far as we understand, our conclusions fully agree with the arguments and expectations of those authors.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions of which form the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic of Coulomb gas integral, Temperley-Lieb type algebras and pure partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this supplementary note, we study the asymptotic behavior of several types of Coulomb gas integrals and construct the pure partition functions for multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ and general multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems.
  For both radial and chordal cases, we prove the linear independence of the ground state solutions $J_{\alpha}^{(m,n)}(\boldsymbol{x})$ to the null vector equations for irrational values of $\kappa \in (0,8)$.
  In particular, we show that the ground state solutions $J^{(m,n)}_\alpha \in B_{m,n}$, indexed by link patterns $\alpha$ with $m$ screening charges, are linearly independent when $\kappa$ is irrational. This is achieved by constructing, for each link pattern $\beta$, a dual functional $l_\beta \in B^{*}_{m,n}$ such that the meander matrix of the corresponding Temperley-Lieb type algebra is given by $M_{\alpha\beta} = l_{\beta}(J^{(m,n)}_\alpha)$. The determinant of this matrix admits an explicit expression and is nonzero for irrational $\kappa$, establishing the desired linear independence.
  As a consequence, we construct the pure partition functions $Z_{\alpha}(\boldsymbol{x})$ of the multiple $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems for each link pattern $\alpha$ by multiplying the inverse of the meander matrix.
  This method can also be extended to the asymptotic analysis of the excited state solutions $K_{\alpha}$ in both radial and chordal cases.</description>
