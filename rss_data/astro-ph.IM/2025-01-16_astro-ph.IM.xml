      <title>Calibration and Applications of the All-Sky Camera at the Ali Observatory in Tibet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-precision calibration method for all-sky cameras has been realized using images from the Ali observatory in Tibet, providing application results for atmospheric extinction, night sky brightness, and known variable stars. This method achieves high-precision calibration for individual all-sky images, with the calibration process introducing deviations of less than 0.5pixels. Within a 70-degree zenith angle, the calibration deviation of the images is less than 0.25pixels. Beyond this angle, the calibration deviation increases significantly due to the sparser distribution of stars. Increasing the number of stars with zenith angles greater than 70degrees used for calibration can improve the calibration accuracy for areas beyond the 70-degree zenith angle, reducing the calibration deviation at an 85-degree zenith angle to 0.2pixels. Analysis of the all-sky images indicates that the atmospheric extinction coefficient at the Ali Observatory is approximately 0.20, and the night sky background brightness is about 21 magnitudes per square arcsecond, suggesting the presence of urban light pollution.</description>

      <title>Phasing the Giant Magellan Telescope: Lab Experiments and First On-sky Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large apertures of the upcoming generation of Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes will enable unprecedented angular resolutions that scale as $\propto$ $\lambda$/D and higher sensitivities that scale as $D^4$ for point sources corrected by adaptive optics. However, all will have pupil segmentation caused by mechanical struts holding up the secondary mirror [European Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope] or intrinsically, by design, as in the Giant Magellan Telescope. These gaps will be separated by more than a typical atmospheric coherence length (Fried Parameter). The pupil fragmentation at scales larger than the typical atmospheric coherence length, combined with wavefront sensors with weak or ambiguous sensitivity to differential piston, can introduce differential piston areas of the wavefront known as "petal modes". Commonly used wavefront sensors, such as a pyramid WFS, also struggle with phase wrapping caused by &gt;$\lambda$/2 differential piston WFE. We have developed the holographic dispersed fringe sensor, a single pupil-plane optic that employs holography to interfere the dispersed light from each segment onto different spatial locations in the focal plane to sense and correct differential piston between the segments. This allows for a very high and linear dynamic piston sensing range of approximately $\pm$10 $\mu$m. We have begun the initial attempts at phasing a segmented pupil utilizing the HDFS on the High Contrast Adaptive optics phasing Testbed and the Extreme Magellan Adaptive Optics instrument (MagAO-X) at the University of Arizona. Additionally, we have demonstrated use of the HDFS as a differential piston sensor on-sky for the first time. We were able to phase each segment to within $\pm\lambda$/11.3 residual piston WFE ($\lambda$ = 800 nm) of a reference segment and achieved ~50 nm RMS residual piston WFE across the aperture in poor seeing conditions.</description>

      <title>Deep inference of simulated strong lenses in ground-based surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large number of strong lenses discoverable in future astronomical surveys will likely enhance the value of strong gravitational lensing as a cosmic probe of dark energy and dark matter. However, leveraging the increased statistical power of such large samples will require further development of automated lens modeling techniques. We show that deep learning and simulation-based inference (SBI) methods produce informative and reliable estimates of parameter posteriors for strong lensing systems in ground-based surveys. We present the examination and comparison of two approaches to lens parameter estimation for strong galaxy-galaxy lenses -- Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). We perform inference on 1-, 5-, and 12-parameter lens models for ground-based imaging data that mimics the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We find that NPE outperforms BNNs, producing posterior distributions that are more accurate, precise, and well-calibrated for most parameters. For the 12-parameter NPE model, the calibration is consistently within $&lt;$10\% of optimal calibration for all parameters, while the BNN is rarely within 20\% of optimal calibration for any of the parameters. Similarly, residuals for most of the parameters are smaller (by up to an order of magnitude) with the NPE model than the BNN model. This work takes important steps in the systematic comparison of methods for different levels of model complexity.</description>

      <title>Improvements to monoscopic analysis for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes: Application to H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) detect gamma rays by measuring the Cherenkov light emitted by secondary particles in the air shower when the gamma rays hit the atmosphere. At low energies, the limited amount of Cherenkov light produced typically implies that the event is registered by one IACT only. Such events are called monoscopic events, and their analysis is particularly difficult. Challenges include the reconstruction of the event's arrival direction, energy, and the rejection of background events. Here, we present a set of improvements, including a machine-learning algorithm to determine the correct orientation of the image, an intensity-dependent selection cut that ensures optimal performance, and a collection of new image parameters. To quantify these improvements, we use the central telescope of the H.E.S.S. IACT array. Knowing the correct image orientation, which corresponds to the arrival direction of the photon in the camera frame, is especially important for the angular reconstruction, which could be improved in resolution by 57% at 100 GeV. The event selection cut, which now depends on the total measured intensity of the events, leads to a reduction of the low-energy threshold for source analyses by ~50%. The new image parameters characterize the intensity and time distribution within the recorded images and complement the traditionally used Hillas parameters in the machine learning algorithms. We evaluate their importance to the algorithms in a systematic approach and carefully evaluate associated systematic uncertainties. We find that including subsets of the new variables in machine-learning algorithms improves the reconstruction and background rejection, resulting in a sensitivity improved by 41% at the low-energy threshold.</description>

      <title>Final design of Cerberus, a three-headed instrument for the OARPAF telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerberus will be a new scientific instrument for the alt-az, 1m-class OARPAF telescope in Northern Italy. Currently, the telescope operates with a CCD camera used for imaging and photometry. One of the objectives of the project is to improve this observing mode with a tip-tilt lens for image stabilization up to 10Hz. Moreover, a long-slit spectroscopy at R 5900 and an optical fiber \'echelle spectroscopy at R 9300 observing modes will be included. These addtional two "heads" of Cerberus will be exclusively selected by moving flat 45 degree mirrors by means of a linear stage placed in a new custom interface flange. The flange will replace the existing one, recovering the included field flattener lens, to ensure optical correction of the imaging channel. We present the already procured COTS hardware, the opto-mechanical design of the interface flange, the results of the Zemax ray tracing and the design of the web-based instrument control software.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-Optimal Stacking Method for Up-the-Ramp Readout Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-destructive readout mode of a detector allows its pixels to be read multiple times during integration, generating a series of "up-the-ramp" images that keep accumulating photons between successive frames. Since the noise is correlated across these images, an optimal stacking generally requires weighting them unequally to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the target. Objects in the sky show wildly different brightness, and the counts in the pixels of the same object also span a wide range. Therefore, a single set of weights cannot be optimal for all cases. To keep the stacked image more easily calibratable, however, we choose to apply the same weight to all the pixels in the same frame. In practice, we find that the results of high-SNR cases degrade only slightly by adopting weights derived for low-SNR cases, whereas the low-SNR cases are more sensitive to the weights applied. We therefore propose a quasi-optimal stacking method that maximizes the stacked SNR for the case of SNR=1 per pixel in the last frame and demonstrate with simulated data that it always enhances the SNR more than the equal-weight stacking method and the ramp fitting method. Furthermore, we give an estimate of the improvement of limiting magnitudes for the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) based on this method. Compared with the conventional readout mode, which is equivalent to taking the last frame of the non-destructive readout, stacking 30 up-the-ramp images can improve the limiting magnitude by about 0.5 mag for CSST near-infrared observations, effectively reducing the readout noise by about 62%.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Wideband Dual Polarization Antenna Array for the Detection and Localization of Bright Fast Radio Transients in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extraordinary astrophysical phenomena characterized by short radio pulses that last only a few milliseconds, yet their power can surpass that of 500 million suns. To date, most detected FRBs originate from beyond our galaxy. However, if an FRB were to originate within the Milky Way, it could be detected using small antennas. In this paper, we propose a compact and ad-hoc antenna array designed for the efficient detection and localization of FRBs within the Milky Way. The antenna operates within the 1200-1800 MHz range and consists of three sub-arrays placed in an L-shape for source localization, occupying a total volume of 80x25x6 cm^3. Each sub-array consists of 4 miniaturized, dual-polarized, half-space radiation antenna elements, forming a one-dimensional array that allows shaping the radiation pattern to match the form of the Milky Way without exhibiting grating lobes. A prototype was constructed and characterized to validate the design. The measured results exhibit good agreement with the simulations. In addition to having a custom elongated radiation pattern, the array has attractive merits, such as low reflections at the input ports, high radiation efficiency, and a distribution that inhibits the existence of phase ambiguities, thus facilitating source localization.</description>

      <title>Measuring the intracluster light fraction with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intracluster light (ICL) is an important tracer of a galaxy cluster's history and past interactions. However, only small samples have been studied to date due to its very low surface brightness and the heavy manual involvement required for the majority of measurement algorithms. Upcoming large imaging surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time are expected to vastly expand available samples of deep cluster images. However, to process this increased amount of data, we need faster, fully automated methods to streamline the measurement process. This paper presents a machine learning model designed to automatically measure the ICL fraction in large samples of images, with no manual preprocessing required. We train the fully supervised model on a training dataset of 50,000 images with injected artificial ICL profiles. We then transfer its learning onto real data by fine-tuning with a sample of 101 real clusters with their ICL fraction measured manually using the surface brightness threshold method. With this process, the model is able to effectively learn the task and then adapt its learning to real cluster images. Our model can be directly applied to Hyper Suprime-Cam images, processing up to 500 images in a matter of seconds on a single GPU, or fine-tuned for other imaging surveys such as LSST, with the fine-tuning process taking just 3 minutes. The model could also be retrained to match other ICL measurement methods. Our model and the code for training it is made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric searches for axion dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves using optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit birefringence effects associated with the evolution of the polarization of light as it propagates through axion dark matter or the background of a passing gravitational wave (GW). We demonstrate that this can be described by a unified formalism, highlighting a synergy between searches for axions and high-frequency GWs. We show that by exploiting this framework, the optical cavities used by the ALPS II experiment can potentially probe axion masses in the range $m_a \sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{eV}$, offering competitive sensitivity with existing laboratory and astrophysical searches. Also building on this approach, we propose using these optical cavities to search for high-frequency GWs by measuring changes in the polarization of their laser. This makes it a promising method for exploring, in the near future, GWs with frequencies above $100$ MHz and strain sensitivities on the order of $10^{-14} \, \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. Such sensitivity allows the exploration of currently unconstrained parameter space, complementing other high-frequency GW experiments. This work contributes to the growing community investigating novel approaches for high-frequency GW detection.</description>

      <title>Constructing Merger Trees of Density Peaks Using Phase-Space Watershed Segmentation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure identification in cosmological simulations plays an important role in analysing simulation outputs. The definition of these structures directly impacts the inferred properties derived from these simulations. This paper proposes a more straightforward definition and model of structure by focusing on density peaks rather than halos and clumps. It introduces a new watershed algorithm that uses phase-space analysis to identify structures, especially in complex environments where traditional methods may struggle due to spatially overlapping structures. Additionally, a merger tree code is introduced to track density peaks across timesteps, making use of the boosted potential for identifying the most bound particles for each peak.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have proposed using laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors to search for ultralight vector and axion dark matter. Vector dark matter can be probed through oscillating forces on suspended mirrors, while axion dark matter can be detected via oscillating polarization rotation of laser beams. This paper reviews these searches with the KAGRA detector in Japan, including the first vector dark matter search with KAGRA's 2020 data and installation of polarization optics for axion dark matter search during the upcoming 2025 observing run.</description>

      <title>Half a Million Binary Stars from the low resolution spectra of LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are prevalent yet challenging to detect. We present a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify binary stars from low-resolution spectra obtained by the LAMOST survey. The CNN is trained on a dataset that distinguishes binaries from single main sequence stars based on their positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Specifically, the training data labels stars with mass ratios between approximately 0.71 and 0.93 as intermediate mass ratio binaries, while excluding those beyond this range. The network achieves high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.949 on the test set. Its performance is further validated against known eclipsing binaries (97% detection rate) and binary stars identified by radial velocity variations (92% detection rate). Applying the trained CNN to a sample of one million main sequence stars from LAMOST DR10 and Gaia DR3 yields a catalog of 468,634 binary stars, which are mainly intermediate mass ratio binaries given the training data. This catalog includes 115 binary stars located beyond 10 kpc from the Sun and 128 cross-matched with known exoplanet hosts from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This new catalog provides a valuable resource for future research on the properties, formation, and evolution of binary systems, particularly for statistically characterizing large populations.</description>
