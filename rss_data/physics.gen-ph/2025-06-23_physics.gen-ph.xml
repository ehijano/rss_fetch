      <title>Nonassociative geometry of nonholonomic phase spaces with star R-flux string deformations and (non) symmetric metrics</title>

Abstract: We elaborate on nonassociative differential geometry of phase spaces endowed with nonholonomic (non-integrable) distributions and frames, nonlinear and linear connections, symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics, and correspondingly adapted quasi-Hopf algebra structures. The approach is based on the concept of nonassociative star product introduced for describing closed strings moving in a constant R-flux background. Generalized Moyal-Weyl deformations are considered when, for nonassociative and noncommutative terms of star deformations, there are used nonholonomic frames (bases) instead of local partial derivatives. In such modified nonassociative and nonholonomic spacetimes and associated complex/ real phase spaces, the coefficients of geometric and physical objects depend both on base spacetime coordinates and conventional (co) fiber velocity/ momentum variables like in (non) commutative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometry. For nonassociative and (non) commutative phase spaces modelled as total spaces of (co) tangent bundles on Lorentz manifolds enabled with star products and nonholonomic frames, we consider associated nonlinear connection, N-connection, structures determining conventional horizontal and (co) vertical (for instance, 4+4) splitting of dimensions and N-adapted decompositions of fundamental geometric objects. There are defined and computed in abstract geometric and N-adapted coefficient forms the torsion, curvature and Ricci tensors. We extend certain methods of nonholonomic geometry in order to construct R-flux deformations of vacuum Einstein equations for the case of N-adapted linear connections and symmetric and nonsymmetric metric structures.</description>

      <title>Equation of State for Tachyon Neutrinos in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports improvements and new results for a well developed theory of tachyons (faster-than-light particles) and follows the suggestion that neutrinos - especially the low energy neutrinos in the Cosmic Neutrino Background - may be tachyons. Starting with an application of the Thomas-Fermi method for studying a mass of particles obeying the Pauli exclusion principle, we find the following (and unusual) equations of state: $p \sim n^{1/2} \sim \rho^{1/3}$ , where n is the particle number density, $\rho$ is the energy density, and $p$ is the pressure.
  We then use these relations in the FLRW model for the evolution of the universe, focusing on the dominant role of the tachyon pressure. The result is a simple formula for the scale factor a(t); and this is found to provide an excellent fit to the famous observational data plotting "Luminosity distance" vs redshift from Type Ia supernovae. There are no free parameters in this theory; and the major uncertainty is an estimate of the tachyon mass at $0.1 eV/c^2$.
  With successful quantitative explanations for both Dark Energy and Dark Matter, this tachyon-neutrino theory is presented as a strong alternative to the currently popular $\Lambda CDM$ theory.</description>
