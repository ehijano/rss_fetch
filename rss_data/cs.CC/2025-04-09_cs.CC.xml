      <title>Polynomial-Time PIT from (Almost) Necessary Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated result of Kabanets and Impagliazzo (Computational Complexity, 2004) showed that PIT algorithms imply circuit lower bounds, and vice versa. Since then it has been a major challenge to understand the precise connections between PIT and lower bounds. In particular, a main goal has been to understand which lower bounds suffice to obtain efficient PIT algorithms, and how close are they to lower bounds that are necessary for the conclusion.
  We construct polynomial-time PIT algorithms from lower bounds that are, up to relatively minor remaining gaps, necessary for the existence of such algorithms. That is, we prove that these lower bounds are, up to the mentioned minor gaps, both sufficient and necessary for polynomial-time PIT, over fields of characteristic zero. Over sufficiently large finite fields, we show a similar result wherein the PIT algorithm runs in time $n^{\log^{(c)}(n)}$, i.e. a power of $c$-iterated log for an arbitrarily large constant $c&gt;1$.
  The key to these improvements is studying PIT versus lower bounds in the uniform setting, in which we focus on proving lower bounds for uniform arithmetic circuits and their variants (and on deducing algorithms from such lower bounds). Indeed, by working in this setting we obtain results that are significantly tighter than previously known results concerning polynomial-time PIT vs lower bounds, and are in fact also tighter than known hardness-vs-randomness connections in the Boolean setting.
  Our results are obtained by combining recent techniques from Boolean hardness vs randomness, and in particular the generator of Chen and Tell (FOCS 2021), with the algebraic hitting-set generator of Guo, Kumar, Saptharishi, and Solomon (SIAM J. Computing 2022) along with the bootstrapping ideas of Agrawal, Ghosh, and Saxena (STOC 2018) and of Kumar, Saptharishi, and Tengse (SODA 2019).</description>

      <title>Group Order is in QCMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that verifying the order of a finite group given as a black-box is in the complexity class QCMA. This solves an open problem asked by Watrous in 2000 in his seminal paper on quantum proofs and directly implies that the Group Non-Membership problem is also in the class QCMA, which further proves a conjecture proposed by Aaronson and Kuperberg in 2006. Our techniques also give improved quantum upper bounds on the complexity of many other group-theoretical problems, such as group isomorphism in black-box groups.</description>

      <title>Kronecker scaling of tensors with applications to arithmetic circuits and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that sufficiently low tensor rank for the balanced tripartitioning tensor $P_d(x,y,z)=\sum_{A,B,C\in\binom{[3d]}{d}:A\cup B\cup C=[3d]}x_Ay_Bz_C$ for a large enough constant $d$ implies uniform arithmetic circuits for the matrix permanent that are exponentially smaller than circuits obtainable from Ryser's formula.
  We show that the same low-rank assumption implies exponential time improvements over the state of the art for a wide variety of other related counting and decision problems.
  As our main methodological contribution, we show that the tensors $P_n$ have a desirable Kronecker scaling property: They can be decomposed efficiently into a small sum of restrictions of Kronecker powers of $P_d$ for constant $d$. We prove this with a new technique relying on Steinitz's lemma, which we hence call Steinitz balancing.
  As a consequence of our methods, we show that the mentioned low rank assumption (and hence the improved algorithms) is implied by Strassen's asymptotic rank conjecture [Progr. Math. 120 (1994)], a bold conjecture that has recently seen intriguing progress.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Pure-State Consistency of Local Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the computational complexity of the pure consistency of local density matrices (PureCLDM) and pure N-representability (Pure-N-Representability; analog of PureCLDM for bosonic or fermionic systems) problems. In these problems the input is a set of reduced density matrices and the task is to determine whether there exists a global pure state consistent with these reduced density matrices. While mixed CLDM, i.e. where the global state can be mixed, was proven to be QMA-complete by Broadbent and Grilo [JoC 2022], almost nothing was known about the complexity of the pure version. Before our work the best upper and lower bounds were QMA(2) and QMA. Our contribution to the understanding of these problems is twofold.
  Firstly, we define a pure state analogue of the complexity class QMA+ of Aharanov and Regev [FOCS 2003], which we call PureSuperQMA. We prove that both pure-N-Representability and PureCLDM are complete for this new class. Along the way we supplement Broadbent and Grilo by proving hardness for 2-qubit reduced density matrices and showing that mixed N-Representability is QMA-complete.
  Secondly, we improve the upper bound on PureCLDM. Using methods from algebraic geometry, we prove that PureSuperQMA is in PSPACE. Our methods, and the PSPACE upper bound, are also valid for PureCLDM with exponential or even perfect precision, hence precisePureCLDM is not preciseQMA(2)=NEXP-complete, unless PSPACE=NEXP. We view this as evidence for a negative answer to the longstanding open question whether PureCLDM is QMA(2)-complete.
  The techniques we develop for our PSPACE upper bound are quite general. We are able to use them for various applications: from proving PSPACE upper bounds on other quantum problems to giving an efficient parallel (NC) algorithm for (non-convex) quadratically constrained quadratic programs with few constraints.</description>
