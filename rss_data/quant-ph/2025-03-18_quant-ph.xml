      <title>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks Targeting Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of the Willow quantum chip by Google has sparked significant interest in quantum computing, ushering in a new wave of advancements in the field. As quantum computing technology continues to mature, secure quantum communication has garnered increasing attention. To establish secure communication, several quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols have been proposed, such as the BB84 protocol, which leverages the principles of quantum superposition and other quantum properties to ensure secure transmission. However, existing QKD protocols may face vulnerabilities under certain conditions. This study proposes two types of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack techniques and demonstrates their potential to compromise quantum cryptography through practical case studies. Furthermore, this study proposes strategies to counteract these MITM attacks and proposes methods to enhance the security of quantum cryptographic systems. The findings offer valuable insights for the future implementation and deployment of secure quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary R\'{e}nyi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Doubly-polylog-time-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation by a polylog-time parallel minimum-weight perfect matching decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing space and time overheads of fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) has been receiving increasing attention as it is crucial for the development of quantum computers and also plays a fundamental role in understanding the feasibility and limitations of realizing quantum advantages. Shorter time overheads are particularly essential for demonstrating quantum computational speedups without compromising runtime advantages. However, surpassing the conventional polylogarithmic (polylog) scaling of time overheads has remained a significant challenge, since it requires addressing all potential bottlenecks, including the nonzero runtime of classical computation for decoding in practical implementations. In this work, we construct a protocol that achieves FTQC with doubly polylog time overhead while maintaining the conventional polylog space overhead. The key to our approach is the development of a highly parallelizable minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, which achieves a polylog parallel runtime in terms of the code size while providing theoretical guarantees on threshold existence and overhead bounds. Our protocol integrates this decoder with a topological-code protocol that incorporates single-shot decoding for efficient syndrome extraction; furthermore, we concatenate this with the concatenated Steane codes to guarantee the existence of the threshold while avoiding a backlog problem, enabling us to achieve doubly polylog time overheads even when accounting for the decoder's runtime. These results suggest the feasibility of surpassing the conventional polylog-time-overhead barrier, opening a new frontier in low-overhead FTQC.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berry curvature characterizes one aspect of the geometry of quantum states. It materializes, among other consequences, as an anomalous velocity of wave packets. In non-Hermitian systems, wave packet dynamics is enriched by additional terms that can be expressed as generalizations of the Berry connection to non-orthogonal eigenstates. Here, we contextualize these anomalous non-Hermitian contributions by showing that they directly arise from the geometry of the underlying quantum states as corrections to the distance between left and perturbed right eigenstates. By calculating the electric susceptibility for a single-band wave packet and comparing it with the wave packet's localization, we demonstrate that these terms can, in some circumstances, lead to a violation of fluctuation-dissipation relations in non-Hermitian systems. We discuss experimental signatures in terms of response functions and transport signatures.</description>

      <title>Gain-modified emission dynamics between two quantum emitters in a plasmonic gain cavity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general theory of gain-modified emission dynamics between two quantum emitters (two level systems) in a linear gain medium, demonstrating how gain modifies the usual radiative decay rates and inter-emitter coupling and decay rates, that are well known from purely lossy systems. We derive a Born-Markov master equation that shows explicitly how gain modifies the usual rates appearing for two emitters in a loss only medium, and introduces new gain terms. We then present Bloch equations in the bare state basis as well as a dressed-state basis (using superradiant and subradiant states). As an application of the theory, we show calculations for a fully three-dimensional metal dimer in a gain-compensated medium, containing two quantum emitters, and show explicit solutions in terms of the quasinormal modes, which easily allows one to obtain all the relevant decay rates. We study the modified decay dynamics, gain excited pumping, as well as the entanglement entropy and spectral emission. We also demonstrate how a breakdown of the weak excitation approximation in the presence of gain requires a careful treatment beyond a linear response, which yields non-trivial incoherent coupling terms that typically are not included in dipole-dipole coupling models or heuristic gain pumping models.</description>

      <title>Reshaping the Quantum Arrow of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal. Yet, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. We show how to exploit the feedback process to design a continuous measurement engine that draws energy from the monitoring process, or to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system.</description>

      <title>Quantum EigenGame for excited state calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the excited states of a given Hamiltonian is computationally hard for large systems, but methods that do so using quantum computers scale tractably. This problem is equivalent to the PCA problem where we are interested in decomposing a matrix into a collection of principal components. Classically, PCA is a well-studied problem setting, for which both centralized and distributed approaches have been developed. On the distributed side, one recent approach is that of EigenGame, a game-theoretic approach to finding eigenvectors where each eigenvector reaches a Nash equilibrium either sequentially or in parallel. With this work, we extend the EigenGame algorithm for both a $0^\text{th}$-order approach and for quantum computers, and harness the framework that quantum computing provides in computing excited states. Results show that using the Quantum EigenGame allows us to converge to excited states of a given Hamiltonian without the need of a deflation step. We also develop theory on error accumulation for finite-differences and parameterized approaches.</description>

      <title>SRBB-Based Quantum State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a scalable algorithm for the approximate quantum state preparation problem is proposed, facing a challenge of fundamental importance in many topic areas of quantum computing. The algorithm uses a variational quantum circuit based on the Standard Recursive Block Basis (SRBB), a hierarchical construction for the matrix algebra of the $SU(2^n)$ group, which is capable of linking the variational parameters with the topology of the Lie group. Compared to the full algebra, using only diagonal components reduces the number of CNOTs by an exponential factor, as well as the circuit depth, in full agreement with the relaxation principle, inherent to the approximation methodology, of minimizing resources while achieving high accuracy. The desired quantum state is then approximated by a scalable quantum neural network, which is designed upon the diagonal SRBB sub-algebra. This approach provides a new scheme for approximate quantum state preparation in a variational framework and a specific use case for the SRBB hierarchy. The performance of the algorithm is assessed with different loss functions, like fidelity, trace distance, and Frobenius norm, in relation to two optimizers: Adam and Nelder-Mead. The results highlight the potential of SRBB in close connection with the geometry of unitary groups, achieving high accuracy up to 4 qubits in simulation, but also its current limitations with an increasing number of qubits. Additionally, the approximate SRBB-based QSP algorithm has been tested on real quantum devices to assess its performance with a small number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Spin contrast, finite temperature, and and noise in matter-wave interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will show how finite-temperature corrections and spin-dependent/independent noise will affect the contrast in a matter-wave interferometer, especially with massive objects and large spatial superposition sizes. Typically, spin is embedded in a nanoparticle as a defect, which can be manipulated by the external magnetic field to create a macroscopic quantum superposition. These massive matter-wave interferometers are the cornerstone for many new fundamental advancements in physics; particularly, macroscopic quantum superposition can use entanglement features to, e.g., test physics beyond the Standard Model, test the equivalence principle, improve quantum sensors, and test the quantum nature of spacetime in a lab. We will consider a Stern-Gerlach type apparatus to create macroscopic quantum superposition in a harmonic oscillator trap, and figure out the spin contrast loss due to linear spin-independent and spin-dependent noise in a single interferometer. We will show that spin contrast loss due to spin-independent noise does not depend on the initial thermal state of the matter wave function. However, spin contrast loss due to spin-dependent fluctuations do depend on the initial thermal occupation of the quantum state. We will keep our discussion general as far as the noise parameters are concerned.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of defects and interfaces for interacting quantum hard disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects and interfaces are essential to understand the properties of matter. However, studying their dynamics in the quantum regime remains a challenge in particular concerning the regime of two spatial dimensions. Recently, it has been shown that a quantum counterpart of the hard-disk problem on a lattice yields defects and interfaces, which are stable just due to quantum effects while they delocalize and dissolve classically. Here, we study in more detail the properties of defects and interfaces in this quantum hard-disk problem with a particular emphasis on the stability of these quantum effects upon including perturbations. Specifically, we introduce short-range soft-core interactions between the hard disks. From both analytical arguments and numerical simulations we find that large classes of defects and interfaces remain stable even under such perturbations suggesting that the quantum nature of the dynamics exhibits a large range of robustness. Our findings demonstrate the stability and non-classical behavior of quantum interface dynamics, offering insights into the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum matter and establishing the quantum hard-disk model as a platform for studying unconventional constrained quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced frequency and temperature estimation by a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology employs quantum properties to enhance the precision of physical parameters, in order to characterize quantum states as well as channels. Frequency and temperature estimations are of fundamental importance for these tasks and have been considerably treated in quantum sensing strategies. From the set of quantum features that can be exploited in quantum metrology, those related to non-Hermitian systems have received much attention in recent times. Here, we consider a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system, the quantum Swanson oscillator, as a probe system, in order to investigate how the non-Hermitian contribution affects the frequency and temperature estimation. We use the quantum Fisher information to compute the main results. Furthermore, to perform a fair comparison, we define a gain function which is the ratio between the quantum Fisher information with the non-Hermitian contribution and the quantum Fisher information when this term becomes Hermitian. In addition, the quantum Fisher information is discussed in terms of the energetic cost to include the non-Hermitian contribution. Given that we obtain the Hermitian counterpart of the Hamiltonian by applying the Dyson map, we also study the estimation of the parameters characterizing this mapping. Our results indicate that the non-Hermitian contribution in the Swanson quantum oscillator can contribute to enhance the frequency and temperature estimation.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of nominally bulk modes, not only drastically reshapes the spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems, but also dramatically modifies the real-time dynamics therein. Here we investigate the time evolution of waves (or quantum-mechanical particles) initialized around the edge of non-Hermitian lattices. The non-Hermitian skin effect tends to localize the wave to the edge, meaning that the real-time dynamics differs from the Bloch-theory picture. We focus on the long-time decay or growth rate of wave function, which is quantified by the Lyapunov exponents. These exponents can be obtained from the saddle points in the complex momentum space. We propose an efficient yet unambiguous criterion for identifying the dominant saddle point that determines the Lyapunov exponents. Our criterion can be precisely formulated in terms of a mathematical concept known as the Lefschetz thimble. Counterintuitively, the seemingly natural criterion based on the imaginary part of the energy fails. Our work provides a coherent theory for characterizing the real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices. Our predictions are testable in various non-Hermitian physical platforms.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant Preparation of Distant Logical Bell Pair -- with application in the magic square game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measures of quantum nonlocality traditionally assume perfect local computation. In real experiments, however, each computational primitive is imperfect. Fault-tolerant techniques enable arbitrarily accurate quantum computation but do not necessarily preserve optimized measures of nonlocality. We examine the impact of low noise on quantum nonlocality in nonlocal games, where even small imperfections can disproportionately increase entanglement consumption. Focusing on the fault-tolerant magic square game, we optimize the tradeoff between noisy entanglement consumption and deficit in the game value. We introduce an interface circuit and logical entanglement purification protocol (EPP) to efficiently translate states between physical and logical qubits and purify noisy logical Bell pair, reducing Bell pair consumption. Our analytical and numerical results, particularly for the $[[7^k,1,3^k]]$ concatenated Steane code, demonstrate exponential Bell pair savings and a higher noise threshold. We establish theoretical lower bounds for local noise threshold of $4.70\times10^{-4}$ and an initial Bell pair infidelity threshold of $18.3\%$. Our framework is adaptable to various quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) and experimental platforms. This work not only advances fault-tolerant nonlocal games but also inspires further research on interfacing different QECCs, fostering modular quantum architectures and the quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Gaussian quantum processes with Gaussian resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum processes is indispensable for the implementation of any task in quantum information processing. In this paper, we develop an efficient method to fully characterize arbitrary Gaussian processes in continuous-variable quantum systems. This is done by directly obtaining all elements of the symplectic matrix that describes the process. Only Gaussian resources such as coherent probes and quadrature measurements are needed for this task. The method is efficient, involving only $O(N^2)$ steps to characterize an $N$-mode system. Further, the method is resilient to uniform loss. We simulate this procedure using the Python package Strawberry Fields. We observe that heterodyne measurements outperform homodyne measurements for reconstructing Gaussian processes.</description>

      <title>A classical proof of quantum knowledge for multi-prover interactive proof systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a proof of knowledge (PoK), a verifier becomes convinced that a prover possesses privileged information. In combination with zero-knowledge proof systems, PoKs are an important part of secure protocols such as digital signature schemes and authentication schemes as they enable a prover to demonstrate possession of a certain piece of information (such as a private key or a credential), without revealing it. Formally, A PoK is defined via the existence of an extractor, which is capable of reconstructing the key information that makes a verifier accept, given oracle access to the prover. We extend the concept of a PoK in the setting of a single classical verifier and two quantum provers, and exhibit the PoK property for a non-local game for the local Hamiltonian problem. More specifically, we construct an extractor which, given oracle access to a provers' strategy that leads to high acceptance probability, is able to reconstruct the ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Our result can be seen as a new form of self-testing, where, in addition to certifying a pre-shared entangled state and the prover's strategy, the verifier also certifies a local quantum state. This technique thus provides a method to ascertain that a prover has access to a quantum system, in particular, a ground state, thus indicating a new level of verification for a proof of quantumness.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics Simulation of the Advection-Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advection-diffusion equation is simulated on a superconducting quantum computer via several quantum algorithms. Three formulations are considered: (1) Trotterization, (2) variational quantum time evolution (VarQTE), and (3) adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS). These schemes were originally developed for the Hamiltonian simulation of many-body quantum systems. The finite-difference discretized operator of the transport equation is formulated as a Hamiltonian and solved without the need for ancillary qubits. Computations are conducted on a quantum simulator (IBM Qiskit Aer) and an actual quantum hardware (IBM Fez). The former emulates the latter without the noise. The predicted results are compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data with infidelities of the order $10^{-5}$. In the quantum simulator, Trotterization is observed to have the lowest infidelity and is suitable for fault-tolerant computation. The AVQDS algorithm requires the lowest gate count and the lowest circuit depth. The VarQTE algorithm is the next best in terms of gate counts, but the number of its optimization variables is directly proportional to the number of qubits. Due to current hardware limitations, Trotterization cannot be implemented, as it has an overwhelming large number of operations. Meanwhile, AVQDS and VarQTE can be executed, but suffer from large errors due to significant hardware noise. These algorithms present a new paradigm for computational transport phenomena on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Particle Transport in Dissipative Long-Range Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inevitable loss of particles in quantum many-body systems provides a more general and experimentally realistic perspective on particle transport. In this work, we determine the maximal speed of macroscopic particle transport in dissipative bosonic systems featuring both long-range hopping and long-range interactions. By developing a generalized optimal transport theory for open quantum systems, we rigorously establish the relationship between the minimum transport time and the source-target distance, and investigate the maximal transportable distance of bosons. We demonstrate that optimal transport exhibits a fundamental distinction depending on whether the system experiences one-body loss or multi-body loss. Furthermore, we present the minimal transport time and the maximal transport distance for systems with both gain and loss. We observe that even an arbitrarily small gain rate enables transport over long distances if the lattice gas is dilute. Moreover, we generally reveal that the emergence of decoherence-free subspaces facilitates the long-distance and perfect transport process. We also derive an upper bound for the probability of transporting a given number of particles during a fixed period with one-body loss. Possible experimental protocols for observing our theoretical predictions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews the current state of the field of quantum repeaters (QRs) based on Quantum Dots (QDs). First, we provide a short introduction to QRs. Then, we give an overview of the state of the art of non-classical photon sources based on III-V QDs. We discuss their performance and benchmark them according to critical parameters such as their low multiphoton emission probability and indistinguishability. Then, we discuss quantum repeaters focusing firstly on all-photonic QRs. Secondly, we discuss memory based QRs with QDs as photon sources and alkali vapors as memories. We review storage protocols and their compatibility with NIR and telecom QDs. Finally, we review enabling technologies that facilitate deploying these systems in commercial fiber networks.</description>

      <title>Ten-channel Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between independent optical combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) frequency comb exhibits broad and narrow-linewidth frequency modes, which make it suitable for quantum communication. However, scalable quantum network based on multiple independent combs is still a challenge due to their fabrication-induced frequency mismatches. This limitation becomes critical in measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution, which requires high visibility of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between multiple frequency channels. Here, we experimentally demonstrate two independent DKS combs with ten spectrally aligned lines without any frequency locking system. The visibility for individual comb-line pairs reaches up to $46.72 \pm 0.63\%$ via precision frequency translation, establishing a foundation for deploying DKS combs in multi-user quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Simulation of the Quantum Random Access Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), despite its fundamental role in quantum information processing, has yet to be experimentally realized. Given this challenge, classical simulations serve as essential tools for gaining deeper insights into the underlying physical mechanisms of quantum systems and for advancing the development of scalable, and reliable quantum devices. However, general-purpose simulation methods become impractical due to exponential memory growth and rising computational costs, leaving an open gap for tailored approaches to simulate QRAM efficiently. Here, we present an efficient and scalable framework for simulating both noiseless and noisy bucket brigade QRAM circuits. Our approach leverages a branch-wise encoding scheme, structuring simulations around query branches rather than full circuits. This encoding enables layer-wise operations and pruning algorithms, significantly improving memory efficiency and simulation speed, particularly in noisy scenarios. As a result, our framework achieves linear computational scaling in the noiseless case and maintains stable performance under realistic noise conditions. On a single workstation, we successfully simulate a 20-layer full-address QRAM in under two hours using less than 1 GB of memory. Additionally, we extend noisy QRAM simulations to 30 layers with $2^{10}$ branches, surpassing the scale of previously reported QRAM simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the integration of our simulator with currently existing quantum simulators by incorporating error filtration techniques to explore noise suppression strategies in QRAM architectures. These results critically assess QRAM's feasibility, highlighting both its potential and limitations in noise suppression, while positioning our simulator as a key tool for evaluating future QRAM-based algorithms and error suppression strategies.</description>

      <title>Contextuality and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical chaos is marked by an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, where infinitesimally close trajectories separate exponentially over time. In quantum mechanics, however, unitary evolution and the uncertainty principle preclude such behavior, necessitating alternative approaches to identifying chaos in quantum systems. One must therefore seek quantum features that can indicate the emergence of chaos in the classical limit. Here, we show that contextuality, a quantum property that defies classical explanations, can serve as a signature of chaos. For a spin system undergoing chaotic dynamics, we demonstrate that violations of Bell-type inequality can effectively differentiate regular and chaotic regions of the phase space, suggesting that the nonclassicality of the system underpins signatures of chaos.</description>

      <title>A metropolitan-scale trapped-ion quantum network node with hybrid multiplexing enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum network and quantum repeater are promising ways to scale up a quantum information system to enable various applications with unprecedented performance. As a current bottleneck of building a long-distance quantum network, the distribution rate of heralded entanglement between remote network nodes is typically much lower than the decoherence rate of each local node, which obstructs the implementation of a metropolitan-scale quantum network with more than two remote nodes. A promising scheme to accelerate the remote entanglement distribution is through multiplexing enhancement based on a multimode quantum network node. In this work, we experimentally realize a functional $5$-ion quantum network node with two different types of qubits inside. We employ a hybrid multiplexing scheme combining the methods of multiple excitation and ion shuttling, in which maximally $44$ time-bin modes are generated and sent through a long fiber to boost the entangling rate. Via this scheme, we can generate heralded ion-photon entanglement with a high fidelity of $96.8\%$/$94.6\%$/$89.8\%$ with a success rate of $263\,\text{s}^{-1}$/$40\,\text{s}^{-1}$/$4.28\,\text{s}^{-1}$, over a fiber of $3\,$m/$1\,$km/$12\,$km, respectively. In addition, the memory qubit can protect the stored quantum information from the destructive ion-photon entangling attempts via dual-type encoding and a memory coherence time of $366\,$ms is achieved. This coherence time has exceeded the expected entanglement generation time $234\,$ms over a $12\,$km fiber, which is realized for the first time in a metropolitan-scale quantum network node.</description>

      <title>Error correction of a logical qubit encoded in a single atomic ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for quantum computers to perform useful algorithms, but large-scale fault-tolerant computation remains out of reach due to demanding requirements on operation fidelity and the number of controllable quantum bits (qubits). Traditional QEC schemes involve encoding each logical qubit into multiple physical qubits, requiring a significant overhead in resources and complexity. Recent theoretical work has proposed a complementary approach of performing error correction at the single-particle level by taking advantage of additional available quantum states, potentially reducing QEC overhead. However, this approach has not been demonstrated experimentally, due in part to the difficulty of performing error measurements and subsequent error correction with high fidelity. Here we demonstrate QEC in a single atomic ion that decreases errors by a factor of up to 2.2 and extends the qubit's useful lifetime by a factor of up to 1.5 compared to an unencoded qubit. The qubit is encoded in spin-cat logical states, and we develop a scheme for autonomous error correction that does not require mid-circuit measurements of an ancilla. Our work is applicable to a wide variety of finite-dimensional quantum systems, and such encodings may prove useful either as components of larger QEC codes, or when used alone in few-qubit devices, such as quantum network nodes.</description>

      <title>Engineering anisotropic Dicke model with dipole-dipole interaction for Rydberg atom arrays in cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic Dicke model reveals the important role that counter-rotating wave terms play in the coupling between light and two level atoms. It is intriguing to generate the model to the strongly correlated many body case, where the competition between atomic interaction and light-atom coupling will induce exotic phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a periodically driving method for engineering an anisotropic Dicke model with strong dipole-dipole interaction between atoms based on Rydberg atom arrays in cavity. By modulating the pumping laser, the ratio of counter-rotating wave terms to rotating ones could be tuned from zero to infinity. As an illustrative example, the superiority of this tunability in the adiabatic state preparation is revealed. Our engineered model provides an extensive foundation for subsequet research of quantum simulation, many-body physics and even information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic random access memory is critical to classical computing but notably absent in experimental quantum computers. Here we realize an 8-bit cascaded random access quantum memory using superconducting circuits and cavities and showcase the ability to perform arbitrary gate operations on it. In addition to individual error channels such as photon loss, quantum memories can also experience decoherence from many-body self-interaction. We characterize the origin and contributions of many-body infidelity throughout the memory cycle. We find that individual modes can be accessed with $\lesssim 1.5\%$ infidelity per mode and that the entire memory can be accessed in arbitrary order with an error rate below the depolarization threshold of the surface code, paving the way for fault-tolerant quantum memories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purity testing protocols (PTPs), i.e., protocols that decide with high probability whether or not a distributed bipartite quantum state is maximally entangled, have been proven to be a useful tool in many quantum communication applications. In this paper, we provide geometrical constructions for such protocols that originate directly from classical linear error correcting codes (LECCs), in a way that the properties of the resulting PTPs are completely determined from those of the LECCs used in the construction. We investigate the implications of our results in various tasks, including error detection, entanglement purification for general quantum error models and quantum message authentication.</description>

      <title>Automatic Event Recognition Employing Optically Excited Electro-Nuclear Spin Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analog automatic event recognition (AER) system can be realized by combining the technique of holographic image recognition with the process of temporal signal correlation employing stimulated photon echo in an ensemble of two-level atoms. For efficient operation of the AER system, the optical transition in the two-level system must have a large oscillator strength. However, this implies a rapid decay of the excited state, which highly constrains the duration of the event that can be recognized, even when the images are retrieved rapidly from a fast parallel optical memory device. This constraint can be overcome by using a three-level Lambda system to transfer optical coherence to long-lived electro-nuclear spin coherence and vice-versa. Here, we present an analysis of the AER process employing such a Lambda system. We also show that due to the longitudinal and transverse variation of the phases of the optical fields undergoing Fresnel diffraction, the density matrix equations must account for the differences in the phases of the coherence excited in each pixel and the corresponding phases of the optical fields in subsequent pulses.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations in a cluster spin model with three-spin interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exactly solvable cluster spin model with three-spin interaction couplings J_x (for XZX spin components) and J_y (for YZY spin components) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field $h$ for a spin chain is investigated. For $h=0$, and with only one nonzero interaction strength, the ground state is the cluster state. Through the Jordan-Wigner fermion mapping, the odd sites and the even sites form two separate transverse-XY chains, connected only through the boundary terms. Consequently, all measures of quantum correlations for nearest neighbour spins, the concurrence, the quantum mutual information and the quantum discord are all zero in the ground state. The dynamics is spin conserving for J_y=J_x, exhibiting a line of critical points for |h/J_x| &lt; 2, with an uncorrelated direct product ground state for |h/J_x|&gt;2. There are several quantum critical points in the parameter space, with multi-fold degenerate ground states. The magnetisation and the global entanglement measure exhibit strong singular features for the spin conserving case. The next-neighbour quantum correlation measures are investigated analytically, which exhibit singular features in the vicinity of degeneracy critical points. The $J_y$- and $h$- derivatives of the concurrence exhibit singular peak behaviour near the degeneracy critical points, except in the spin conserving case where the derivatives are zero.</description>

      <title>Data Encoding for VQC in Qiskit, A Comparison With Novel Hybrid Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If quantum machine learning emulates the ways of classical machine learning, data encoding in a quantum neural network is imperative for many reasons. One of the key ones is the complexity attributed to the data size depending upon the features and types, which is the essence of machine learning. While the standard various encoding techniques exist for quantum computing, hybrid one is not among many, though it tends to offer some distinct advantages, viz. efficient qubits utilization and increased entanglement, which fits well for variation quantum classifier algorithm by manipulating the essential criteria of ZZFeatureMaps and RealAmplitudes. While Amplitude encoding can turn traits normalized into quantum amplitudes, encoding an angle by using Ry gates to encode feature values into rotation angles, and phase encoding by using Rz gates to encode extra feature information as phase is plausible to combine all together. By combining these three methods, this paper demonstrates that efficient qubit usage is ensured as Amplitude encoding reduces the required qubits, Angle encoding makes state freedom better and is used for expressive encoding, and Phase-based distinction. Finally, using classical optimizers, the hybrid encoding technique through VQC is fit in training and testing using a synthetic dataset, and results have been compared to the standard VQC encoding in qiskit machine learning ecosystems.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a Distributed Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) framework that leverages modular quantum computing to address scalability challenges on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. By embedding variational quantum circuits into LSTM cells, the QLSTM captures long-range temporal dependencies, while a distributed architecture partitions the underlying Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) into smaller, manageable subcircuits that can be executed on a network of quantum processing units. We assess the proposed framework using nontrivial benchmark problems such as damped harmonic oscillators and Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average sequences. Our results demonstrate that the distributed QLSTM achieves stable convergence and improved training dynamics compared to classical approaches. This work underscores the potential of modular, distributed quantum computing architectures for large-scale sequence modelling, providing a foundation for the future integration of hybrid quantum-classical solutions into advanced Quantum High-performance computing (HPC) ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pulse Gate Attack on IM/DD Optical Key Distribution Exploiting Symbol Shape Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensity modulation/direct detection (IM/DD) optical key distribution (OKD) is a method to generate a secret key whose security against passive eavesdropping is guaranteed by the shot noise inherent to the photodetection process. Here the effects of intensity-dependent symbol shape distortion on the IM/DD OKD security are investigated assuming that the eavesdropper can implement temporal mode demultiplexing using e.g the quantum pulse gating technique. The quantitative analysis includes key generation based on either hard- or soft-decoding of the detected signal as well as the impact of excess detection noise. A simple rule-of-thumb relation between the severity of the symbol shape distortion and the signal strength required to ensure key security is presented.</description>

      <title>A variational formulation of the governing equations of ideal quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the least action principle to the motion of an ideal gas, we find Bernoulli's equation where the local velocity is expressed as the gradient of a velocity potential, while the internal energy depends on the interaction among the particles of the gas. Then, assuming that the internal energy is proportional non-locally to the logarithm of the mass density and truncating the resulting sum of density gradients after the second term, we find an additional Bohm's quantum potential term in the internal energy. Therefore, the Bernoulli equation reduces to the Madelung equation, revealing a novel classical description of quantum fluids that does not require to postulate quantum mechanics. Finally, non-locality can be removed by introducing a retarded potential, thus leading to a covariant formulation of the quantum potential and of the equation of motion of an ideal quantum fluid.</description>

      <title>Harnessing of temporal dispersion for integrated pump filtering in spontaneous heralded single-photon generation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cointegration of heralded single-photon generation and on-chip detection requires the ability to differentiate between pump light and single photons. We explored the dispersion-induced temporal separation of optical pulses to reach this goal. Our method exploits the distinct group velocities of pump light and single photons, as well as single-photon detectors with high timing resolution. We simulate the propagation for photon pair generation by spontaneous parametric down-conversion in titanium in-diffused waveguides in lithium niobate and thin-film lithium niobate, and spontaneous four-wave mixing in silicon on insulator and silicon nitride. For the different integration platforms, we show the propagation distance required to sufficiently distinguish between pump and single photons for different timing resolutions, and demonstrate that this should be feasible with current superconducting nanowire single-photon detector technologies. Finally, we experimentally simulate our approach using the dispersion in the optical fiber.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and precise characterization of Gaussian states is crucial for their effective use in quantum technologies. In this work, we apply a multi-parameter moment-based estimation method that enables rapid and accurate determination of squeezing, antisqueezing, and the squeezing angle of the squeezed vacuum state. Compared to conventional approaches, our method achieves faster parameter estimation with reduced uncertainty, reaching the Cram\'er-Rao bound. We validate its effectiveness using the two most common measurement schemes in continuous-variable quantum optics: homodyne detection and double homodyne detection. This rapid estimation framework is well-suited for dynamically characterizing sources with time-dependent parameters, potentially enabling real-time feedback stabilization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent storage, buffering and retrieval of photons in a quantum memory enables the scalable creation of photonic entangled states via linear optics and repeat-until-success, unlocking applications in quantum communications and photonic quantum computing. Quantum memories based on off-resonant cascaded absorption (ORCA) in atomic vapours allow this storage to be broadband, noise-free, and high efficiency. Here, we implement a cavity-enhanced ORCA memory with reduced footprint and reduced power requirements compared to conventional single-pass schemes. By combining a strong magnetic field with polarisation control, we maintain a Doppler-free interaction and eliminate the need for optical pumping. Our design establishes the feasibility of large arrays of ultra-compact, low-power, near-unit-efficiency, noiseless quantum memories running at GHz bandwidth, without the need for atom trapping or cryogenics.</description>

      <title>Parameterized bipartite entanglement measures and entanglement constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel class of parameterized entanglement measures which are named as $G_\omega$-concurrence ($G_\omega$C) ($0&lt;\omega\leq1$), and demonstrate comprehensively that they satisfy all the necessary axiomatic conditions required for an entanglement measure. Furthermore, we derive an analytical formula relating $G_\omega$C to concurrence for the range of $0.85798\leq\omega\leq1$ within two-qubit systems. Additionally, we prove a new polygamy relation of multiqubit quantum entanglement in terms of $G_\omega$-concurrence of assistance ($G_\omega$CoA). However, it fails to obey the monogamy relation, but we have demonstrated that the squared $G_\omega$-concurrence (S$G_\omega$C) does obeys a general monogamy relation in an arbitrary $N$-qubit mixed state. Based on the monogamy properties of S$G_\omega$C, we can construct the corresponding multipartite entanglement indicators, which can detect all genuine multiqubit entangled states even in the case of $N$-tangle vanishes. In addition, for multipartite higher-dimensional systems, it is illustrated that S$G_\omega$C still has the applicability of the monogamy relation.</description>

      <title>Revisit on quantum parameter estimation approach for Mach-Zehnder interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mach-Zehnder interferometer is a fundamental tool for measuring phase shifts between two light paths, serving as a crucial prototype for achieving high-precision measurements in various scientific and technological applications. In this study, we analyze different models for estimating relative phase shift in a general two-arm Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We demonstrated that single-parameter estimation models can be reduced from the two-parameter estimation model by imposing appropriate constraints on the parameter space. To make quantum Fisher information of the single-parameter estimation models meaningful, the corresponding constraints must be guaranteed in the experiment implementation. Furthermore, we apply the quantum Fisher information approach to analyze the Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the an input state composed of a displaced squeezed vacuum state and a coherent state, providing insights into the precision limits of such configurations.</description>

      <title>QuGStep: Refining Step Size Selection in Gradient Estimation for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising approach to solving computationally demanding problems by combining parameterized quantum circuits with classical optimization. Estimating probabilistic outcomes on quantum hardware requires repeated measurements (shots). However, in practice, the limited shot budget introduces significant noise in the evaluation of the objective function. Gradient estimation in VQAs often relies on the finite-difference, which evaluates the noisy objective function at perturbed circuit parameter values. The accuracy of this estimation is highly dependent on the choice of step size for these perturbations. An inappropriate step size can exacerbate the impact of noise, causing inaccurate gradient estimates and hindering the classical optimization in VQAs. This paper proposes QuGStep, an algorithm that addresses the challenge of determining the appropriate step size for finite-difference gradient estimation under a shot budget. QuGStep is grounded in a theorem that proves the optimal step size, which accounts for the shot budget, minimizes the error bound in gradient estimation using finite differences. Numerical experiments approximating the ground state energy of several molecules demonstrate that QuGStep can identify the appropriate step size for the given shot budget to obtain effective gradient estimation. Notably, the step size identified by QuGStep achieved convergence to the ground state energy with over 96% fewer shots compared to using a default step size. These findings highlight the potential of QuGStep to improve the practical deployment and scalability of quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an Otto thermodynamic cycle with a qubit Unruh-DeWitt detector as the working medium, coupled to a massless, conformally coupled scalar quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole spacetime. We employ the thermal properties of the field to model heat and cold reservoirs between which the thermal machine operates. Treating the detector as an open quantum system, we employ a master equation to study its finite-time dynamics during each cycle stroke. We evaluate the output performance of the Otto heat engine and refrigerator by computing, respectively, the total work output and the cooling power for each of the Neumann, transparent, and Dirichlet boundary condition cases satisfied by the field at spatial infinity. Furthermore, we evaluate the optimal performance of the thermal machine by analyzing its efficiency at maximum power output and ecological impact. Our study presents a general framework for understanding the finite-time operation of relativistic quantum thermal machines, focusing on their energy optimization.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of superdiffusion breakdown in Heisenberg chains via 2D interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing superdiffusive scaling in the spin transport of the integrable 1D Heisenberg model is one of the key discoveries in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Despite this remarkable theoretical development and the subsequent experimental observation of the phenomena in KCuF3, real materials are often imperfect and contain integrability breaking interactions. Understanding the effect of such terms on the superdiffusion is crucial in identifying connections to such materials. Current quantum hardware has already ascertained its utility in studying such non-equilibrium phenomena by simulating the superdiffusion of the 1D Heisenberg model. In this work, we perform a quantum simulation of the superdiffusion breakdown by generalizing the superdiffusive Floquet-type 1D model to a general 2D model. We comprehensively study the effect of different 2D interactions on the superdiffusion breakdown by tuning up their strength from zero, corresponding to the 1D Heisenberg chain, to higher values. We observe that certain 2D interactions are more resilient against superdiffusion breakdown than the others and that the SU(2) preserving 2D interaction has the highest resilience among all the 2D interactions we study. We observe that the location and multitude of the 2D interactions of a certain type do not change the relative resilience, but simply affect the time of onset of the breakdown. The superdiffusion breakdown was also captured in quantum hardware with a remarkable accuracy, further establishing the quantum computer's applicability in simulating interesting non-equilibrium quantum many-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Device-independent secure correlations in sequential quantum scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum information is attracting significant attention, particularly for its applications in information security. This interest arises because the security of device-independent protocols relies solely on the observed outcomes of spatially separated measurements and the validity of quantum physics. Sequential scenarios, i.e., where measurements occur in a precise temporal order, have been proved to enhance performance of device-independent protocols in some specific cases by enabling the reuse of the same quantum state. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to designing sequential quantum protocols for device-independent security. Our method begins with a bipartite self-testing qubit protocol and transforms it into a sequential protocol by replacing one measurement with its non-projective counterpart and adding an additional user thereafter. We analytically prove that, with this systematic construction, the resulting ideal correlations are secure in the sense that they cannot be reproduced as a statistical mixture of other correlations, thereby enabling, for example, the generation of maximal device-independent randomness. The general recipe we provide can be exploited for further development of new device-independent quantum schemes for security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce QSTToolkit, a Python library for performing quantum state tomography (QST) on optical quantum state measurement data. The toolkit integrates traditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with deep learning-based techniques to reconstruct quantum states. It includes comprehensive noise models to simulate both intrinsic state noise and measurement imperfections, enabling the realistic recreation of experimental data. QSTToolkit bridges TensorFlow, a leading deep learning framework, with QuTiP, a widely used quantum physics toolbox for Python. This paper describes the library's features, including its data generation capabilities and the various QST methods implemented.

      <title>Identifying Materials-Level Sources of Performance Variation in Superconducting Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</description>

      <title>Pauli Network Circuit Synthesis with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based method for re-synthesis of quantum circuits containing arbitrary Pauli rotations alongside Clifford operations. By collapsing each sub-block to a compact representation and then synthesizing it step-by-step through a learned heuristic, we obtain circuits that are both shorter and compliant with hardware connectivity constraints. We find that the method is fast enough and good enough to work as an optimization procedure: in direct comparisons on 6-qubit random Pauli Networks against state-of-the-art heuristic methods, our RL approach yields over 2x reduction in two-qubit gate count, while executing in under 10 milliseconds per circuit. We further integrate the method into a collect-and-re-synthesize pipeline, applied as a Qiskit transpiler pass, where we observe average improvements of 20% in two-qubit gate count and depth, reaching up to 60% for many instances, across the Benchpress benchmark. These results highlight the potential of RL-driven synthesis to significantly improve circuit quality in realistic, large-scale quantum transpilation workloads.</description>

Abstract: In the rapidly expanding realm of photonic quantum information processing, the role of multi-mode squeezed light interferometers is critical. These devices are pivotal in enabling a wide range of applications from quantum computing and sensing to advanced communication systems. Although linear interferometers with full programmability have been realized with up to 32 modes, scaling to hundreds of modes is hampered by exponential increases in optical losses with circuit depth. Here we present and experimentally demonstrate highly scalable, low-loss multimode squeezed light interferometer schemes, capitalizing on measurement-induced operations and a shallow circuit approach. We validate our approach through a 6-mode interferometer and subsequently demonstrate its scalability by extending the design to 400 modes. This development marks a step toward realizing large-scale Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) algorithm applications, employing shallow circuits and addressing the prevalent issue of optical losses in photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Blockchain with proof of quantum work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a blockchain architecture in which mining requires a quantum computer. The consensus mechanism is based on proof of quantum work, a quantum-enhanced alternative to traditional proof of work that leverages quantum supremacy to make mining intractable for classical computers. We have refined the blockchain framework to incorporate the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, ensuring stability against sampling errors and hardware inaccuracies. To validate our approach, we implemented a prototype blockchain on four D-Wave$^{\rm TM}$ quantum annealing processors geographically distributed within North America, demonstrating stable operation across hundreds of thousands of quantum hashing operations. Our experimental protocol follows the same approach used in the recent demonstration of quantum supremacy [1], ensuring that classical computers cannot efficiently perform the same computation task. By replacing classical machines with quantum systems for mining, it is possible to significantly reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact traditionally associated with blockchain mining. Beyond serving as a proof of concept for a meaningful application of quantum computing, this work highlights the potential for other near-term quantum computing applications using existing technology.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of High-Fidelity Entangled Logical Qubits using Transmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) codes are necessary to fault-tolerantly operate quantum computers. However, every such code is inherently limited by its inability to detect logical errors. Here, we propose and implement a method that leverages dynamical decoupling (DD) to drastically suppress logical errors. The key to achieving this is to use the logical operators of the QEC code as DD pulses, which we refer to as logical dynamical decoupling (LDD). The resulting hybrid QEC-LDD strategy is in principle capable of handling arbitrary weight errors. We test QEC-LDD using IBM transmon devices and the [[4,2,2]] code, demonstrating performance that significantly exceeds the capabilities of using either this code or DD in isolation. We present a method that allows for the detection of logical errors affecting logically encoded Bell states, which, in this case, arise primarily from crosstalk among physical qubits. Building on this, we experimentally demonstrate high-fidelity entangled logical qubits.</description>

      <title>EnQode: Fast Amplitude Embedding for Quantum Machine Learning Using Classical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplitude embedding (AE) is essential in quantum machine learning (QML) for encoding classical data onto quantum circuits. However, conventional AE methods suffer from deep, variable-length circuits that introduce high output error due to extensive gate usage and variable error rates across samples, resulting in noise-driven inconsistencies that degrade model accuracy. We introduce EnQode, a fast AE technique based on symbolic representation that addresses these limitations by clustering dataset samples and solving for cluster mean states through a low-depth, machine-specific ansatz. Optimized to reduce physical gates and SWAP operations, EnQode ensures all samples face consistent, low noise levels by standardizing circuit depth and composition. With over 90% fidelity in data mapping, EnQode enables robust, high-performance QML on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our open-source solution provides a scalable and efficient alternative for integrating classical data with quantum models.</description>

      <title>TEPID-ADAPT: Adaptive variational method for simultaneous preparation of low-temperature Gibbs and low-lying eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing Gibbs states, which describe systems in equilibrium at finite temperature, is of great importance, particularly at low temperatures. In this work, we propose a new method -- TEPID-ADAPT -- that prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a given Hamiltonian at low temperatures using a variational method that is partially adaptive and uses a minimal number of ancillary qubits. We achieve this using a truncated, parametrized eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian. Beyond preparing Gibbs states, this approach also straightforwardly gives us access to the truncated low-energy eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian, making it also a method that prepares excited states simultaneously. As a result of this, we are also able to prepare thermal states at any lower temperature of the same Hamiltonian without further optimization.</description>

      <title>Partial Quantum Shadow Tomography for Structured Operators and its Experimental Demonstration using NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum shadow tomography based on the classical shadow representation provides an efficient way to estimate properties of an unknown quantum state without performing a full quantum state tomography. In scenarios where estimating the expectation values for only certain classes of observables is required, obtaining information about the entire density matrix is unnecessary. We propose a partial quantum shadow tomography protocol, which allows estimation of a subset of density matrix elements contributing to the expectation values of certain classes of structured observables. This method utilizes tomographically incomplete subsets of single qubit Pauli basis measurements to perform partial shadow tomography, making it experimentally more efficient. We demonstrate the advantage over unitary $k$-designs such as Clifford, full Pauli basis, and methods utilizing mutually unbiased bases by numerically analyzing the protocol for structured density matrices and observables. We experimentally demonstrate the partial shadow estimation scheme for a wide class of two-qubit states (pure, entangled, and mixed) in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) platform, which relies on ensemble-based measurements. The full density matrix experimentally reconstructed by combining different partial estimators produces fidelities exceeding 97%.</description>

      <title>Scalable and fault-tolerant preparation of encoded k-uniform states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $k$-uniform states are valuable resources in quantum information, enabling tasks such as teleportation, error correction, and accelerated quantum simulations. The practical realization of $k$-uniform states, at scale, faces major obstacles: verifying $k$-uniformity is as difficult as measuring code distances, and devising fault-tolerant preparation protocols further adds to the complexity. To address these challenges, we present a scalable, fault-tolerant method for preparing encoded $k$-uniform states, and we illustrate our approach using surface and color codes. We first present a technique to determine $k$-uniformity of stabilizer states directly from their stabilizer tableau. We then identify a family of Clifford circuits that ensures both fault tolerance and scalability in preparing these states. Building on the encoded $k$-uniform states, we introduce a hybrid physical-logical strategy that retains some of the error-protection benefits of logical qubits while lowering the overhead for implementing arbitrary gates compared to fully logical algorithms. We show that this hybrid approach can outperform fully physical implementations for resource-state preparation, as demonstrated by explicit constructions of $k$-uniform states.</description>

      <title>Exciton-polaritons and exciton localization from a first-principles interacting Green's function formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons -- hybrid states of photons and excitons -- offer unique avenues for controlling electronic, optical, and chemical properties of materials. However, their modeling is mostly limited to formalisms that wash out atomistic details and many-body physics critical to describing real systems. Here, we present an ab initio Green's function formalism based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) wherein exciton-polaritons naturally emerge through an attractive, dynamical electron-hole exchange interaction. In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.</description>

      <title>The Birth of Quantum Mechanics: A Historical Study Through the Canonical Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the historical development of the theory of quantum mechanics between 1900 and 1927 by chronological examination of the foundational papers and ideas. Beginning with Planck's introduction of energy quantisation in blackbody radiation, we follow the emergence of Einstein's light quanta hypothesis, Bohr's atomic model, and the statistical implications of indistinguishable particles. Special emphasis is placed on the transition from the Old Quantum Theory to modern quantum mechanics, particularly through Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schr\"{o}dinger's wave mechanics. This study aims to provide a structured historical account, offering insights into the conceptual transformations that led to quantum mechanics while making the development accessible to physicists, historians of science, and advanced students interested in the origins of modern quantum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking advantage of time-dependent rotations of electronic orbitals, we introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopic bath, revealing that almost all rotated orbitals can be made inactive (in a trivial product state). Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimension saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow precisely the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the temporal and spatial domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz and immiscible to miscible quenching instabilities in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible to miscible quenching transition (IMQT), under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex productions and sound-wave (phonon) propagations. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number $k$. The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$, for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals. Deviating from the classical scaling, a kind of ``Bottleneck effect" is noticed in the IMQT spectra.</description>

      <title>Ehrenfest dynamics accelerated with SPEED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed quantum-classical methods, such as surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics, have proven useful for describing molecular processes involving multiple electronic states. These methods require propagating many independent trajectories, which is computationally demanding. Therefore, we propose the single potential evaluation Ehrenfest dynamics (SPEED), a variation of Ehrenfest dynamics where all trajectories are propagated using a common local quadratic effective potential in the diabatic representation. This approach replaces the computational cost of propagating multiple trajectories with the evaluation of a single Hessian at each time step. We demonstrate the equivalence of standard Ehrenfest dynamics and SPEED in two realistic systems with (at most) quadratic diabatic potential energy surfaces and couplings: a quadratic vibronic coupling Hamiltonian model describing internal conversion in pyrazine and a model of atomic adsorption on a solid surface. The efficiency gain of our approach is particularly advantageous in on-the-fly ab initio applications. For this reason, we combined SPEED with the ALMO(MSDFT2) electronic structure method, which provides the diabatic potential describing charge transfer between two molecules. We find that SPEED qualitatively captures the temperature dependence of the hole transfer rate between two furan moieties and accurately predicts the final charge distribution after the collision. In contrast, but as expected, our approach is insufficient for describing photoisomerization of retinal due to the high anharmonicity of the potential energy surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable right-circularly polarized state of a two-level atomic system in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the geometric quantum complexity of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at finite temperature. Specifically, we use the Bures and Sj\"oqvist metrics -- generalizations of the Fubini-Study metric for mixed quantum states, as well as the Nielsen geometric complexity approach based on purification of mixed states. Starting from the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian of BEC, which exhibits an $SU(1,1)$ symmetry, we explicitly derive and compare the complexities arising from these three distinct measures. For the Bures and Sj\"oqvist metrics, analytical and numerical evaluations of the corresponding geodesics are provided, revealing characteristic scaling behaviors with respect to temperature. In the Nielsen complexity approach, we rigorously handle the gauge freedoms associated with mixed state purification and non-uniqueness unitary operations, demonstrating that the resulting complexity aligns precisely with the Bures metric.

      <description>arXiv:2503.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention to establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has proposed the entropic quantum gravity approach that proposes an action for gravity given by the quantum relative entropy between the metrics associated to a manifold. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the entropic quantum gravity action. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and open new avenues for establishing fundamental relations between brain research, machine learning and entropic quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered Critical Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of frustration-free free-fermion systems and derive their necessary and sufficient conditions. Assuming locality and translation invariance, we find that the possible band touching between the valence bands and the conduction bands is always quadratic or softer, which rules out the possibility of describing Dirac and Weyl semimetals using frustration-free local Hamiltonians. We further construct a frustration-free free-fermion model on the honeycomb lattice and show that its density fluctuations acquire an anomalous gap originating from the diverging quantum metric associated with the quadratic band-touching points. Nevertheless, an $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size scaling of the charge-neutral excitation gap can be verified even in the presence of interactions, consistent with the more general results we derive in an accompany work [arXiv:2503.12879].</description>

      <title>Localization and entanglement entropy in the Discrete Non-Linear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we perform an accurate numerical study of the very peculiar thermodynamic properties of the localized high-energy phase of the Discrete Non-Linear Schr\"odinger Equation (DNLSE). A numerical sampling of the microcanonical ensemble done by means of Hamiltonian dynamics reveals a new and subtle relation between the presence of the localized phase and a non-trivial behaviour of entanglement entropy. Our finding that the entanglement entropy grows as $S_{\text{ent}}(N) \sim \log(N)$ beautifully encodes the lack of additivity in the DNLSE non-thermal localized phase and reveals how a property so far believed peculiar of purely quantum systems may characterize even certain classical frameworks.</description>

      <title>Approximation of diffeomorphisms for quantum state transfers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we seek to combine two emerging standpoints in control theory. On the one hand, recent advances in infinite-dimensional geometric control have unlocked a method for controlling (with arbitrary precision and in arbitrarily small times) state transfers for bilinear Schr\"odinger PDEs posed on a Riemannian manifold $M$. In particular, these arguments rely on controllability results in the group of the diffeomorphisms of $M$. On the other hand, using tools of $\Gamma$-convergence, it has been proved that we can phrase the retrieve of a diffeomorphism of $M$ as an ensemble optimal control problem. More precisely, this is done by employing a control-affine system for \emph{simultaneously} steering a finite swarm of points towards the respective targets. Here we blend these two theoretical approaches and numerically find control laws driving state transitions (such as eigenstate transfers) in a bilinear Schr\"{o}dinger PDE posed on the torus. Such systems have experimental relevance and are currently used to model rotational dynamics of molecules, and cold atoms trapped in periodic optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slater determinants have underpinned quantum chemistry for nearly a century, yet their full potential has remained challenging to exploit. In this work, we show that a variational wavefunction composed of a few hundred optimized non-orthogonal determinants can achieve energy accuracies comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach exploits the quadratic dependence of the energy on selected parameters, permitting their exact optimization, and employs an efficient tensor contraction algorithm to compute the effective Hamiltonian with a computational cost scaling as the fourth power of the number of basis functions. We benchmark the accuracy of the proposed method with exact full-configuration interaction results where available, and we achieve lower variational energies than coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) for several molecules in the double-zeta basis. We conclude by discussing limitations and extensions of the technique, and the potential impact on other many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Stability and quasi-Periodicity of Many-Body Localized Dynamics</title>

Abstract: The connection between entanglement dynamics and non-equilibrium statistics in isolated many-body quantum systems has been established both theoretically and experimentally. Many-Body Localization (MBL), a phenomenon where interacting particles in disordered (i.e., random) chains fail to thermalize, exemplifies this connection. However, the systematic proof of critical phenomena such as MBL remains challenging due to the lack of robust methods for analyzing many-body entanglement dynamics. In this paper, we identify MBL through quasi-periodic dynamics in the entanglement evolution of subsystems in a disordered Heisenberg chain. This new form of characterizing MBL, through stable quasi-periodic dynamics of entanglement -- where stable means they persist in the thermodynamic limit -- concretely distinguishes between two competing scenarios: fully localized behavior of subsystems or slowly, exponentially slow in disorder, thermalizing subsystems -- a heated controversy in the literature. Utilizing perturbation theory, we derive the entanglement dynamics of single spins through an infinite perturbative series, while also modeling rare Griffiths regions (locally thermal inclusions). Our results prove that in regimes of sufficiently strong disorder, the entanglement evolution of individual subsystems remains quasi-periodic in the thermodynamic limit, thereby providing concrete evidence for the stability of MBL dynamics in disordered Heisenberg chains. This behavior contrasts with the widely reported logarithmic growth of subsystem entanglement in the MBL phase. We show that the logarithmic growth observed in prior studies arises from statistical ensemble averaging, which is prohibited due to the intrinsic non-ergodic dynamics characteristic of MBL systems, rooted in their quasi-periodic features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting many-body quantum systems and their dynamics, while fundamental to modern science and technology, are formidable to simulate and understand. However, by discovering their symmetries, conservation laws, and integrability one can unravel their intricacies. Here, using up to 124 qubits of a fully programmable quantum computer, we uncover local conservation laws and integrability in one- and two-dimensional periodically-driven spin lattices in a regime previously inaccessible to such detailed analysis. We focus on the paradigmatic example of disorder-induced ergodicity breaking, where we first benchmark the system crossover into a localized regime through anomalies in the one-particle-density-matrix spectrum and other hallmark signatures. We then demonstrate that this regime stems from hidden local integrals of motion by faithfully reconstructing their quantum operators, thus providing a detailed portrait of the system's integrable dynamics. Our results demonstrate a versatile strategy for extracting the hidden dynamical structure from noisy experiments on large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly-correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for a digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filling two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In such example we obtain fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable to study the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11647v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is arguably one of the most explored applications of near-term quantum devices. Much focus has been put on notions of variational quantum machine learning where parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are used as learning models. These PQC models have a rich structure which suggests that they might be amenable to efficient dequantization via random Fourier features (RFF). In this work, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which RFF does indeed provide an efficient dequantization of variational quantum machine learning for regression. We build on these insights to make concrete suggestions for PQC architecture design, and to identify structures which are necessary for a regression problem to admit a potential quantum advantage via PQC based optimization.</description>

      <title>Low-overhead non-Clifford fault-tolerant circuits for all non-chiral abelian topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a family of explicit geometrically local circuits on a 2-dimensional planar grid of qudits, realizing any abelian non-chiral topological phase as an actively error-corrected fault-tolerant memory. These circuits are constructed from measuring 1-form symmetries in discrete fixed-point path integrals, which we express through cellular cohomology and higher-order cup products. The specific path integral we use is the abelian Dijkgraaf-Witten state sum on a 3-dimensional cellulation, which is a spacetime representation of the twisted quantum double model. The resulting circuits are based on a syndrome extraction circuit of the (qudit) stabilizer toric code, into which we insert non-Clifford phase gates that implement the ``twist''. The overhead compared to the toric code is moderate, in contrast to known constructions for twisted abelian phases. We also show that other architectures for the (qudit) toric code phase, like measurement-based topological quantum computation or Floquet codes, can be enriched with phase gates to implement twisted quantum doubles instead of their untwisted versions. As a further result, we prove fault tolerance under arbitrary local (including non-Pauli) noise for a very general class of topological circuits that we call 1-form symmetric fixed-point circuits. This notion unifies the circuits in this paper as well as the stabilizer toric code, subsystem toric code, measurement-based topological quantum computation, or the (CSS) honeycomb Floquet code. We also demonstrate how our method can be adapted to construct fault-tolerant circuits for specific non-Abelian phases. In the appendix we present an explicit combinatorial procedure to define formulas for higher cup products on arbitrary cellulations, which might be interesting in its own right to the TQFT and topological-phases community.</description>

Abstract: Spin ensembles play a pivotal role in various quantum applications such as metrology and simulating many-body physics. Recent research has proposed utilizing spin cat states to encode logical quantum information, with logical lifetimes potentially on the order of seconds, achieved via enhanced collective interactions that scale with system size. We investigate the dynamics of spin cat states under inhomogeneous broadening, revealing a phenomenon termed 'parity-sensitive inhomogeneous dephasing': for small amplitudes, odd cat states are significantly more susceptible to inhomogeneous dephasing compared to even cat states due to the difference in parity symmetry. This discrepancy between even and odd cat states vanishes at large amplitudes, and behave similarly to a spin coherent state with the same amplitude. To analyze the stability of the spin coherent state, we perform a mean-field analysis of the driven-dissipative dynamics, from which we identify a synchronization phase transition wherein the ensemble becomes completely dephased beyond a critical inhomogeneous linewidth. The mean-field analysis suggests that the dissipative stabilization can suppress the decoherence effects from inhomogeneous broadening. We argue that the stability of the mean-field model provides a reasonable estimate for that of spin cat states with a large amplitude in the full quantum model. Our findings shed light on the stability of collective spin states, important for advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation of multi-controlled quantum gates which provides significant reductions of cost compared to state-of-the-art methods. The operator applied on the target qubit is a unitary, special unitary, or the Pauli X operator (Multi-Controlled Toffoli), and requires one clean ancilla, no ancilla, and one dirty ancilla, respectively. We generalize our methods for any number of target qubits, and provide further cost reductions if additional ancilla qubits are available. For each type of multi-controlled gate, we provide implementations for unrestricted (all-to-all) connectivity and for linear-nearest-neighbor. All of the methods use a linear cost of gates from the Clifford+T (fault-tolerant) set. In the context of linear-nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, the cost and depth of our circuits scale linearly irrespective of the position of the qubits on which the gate is applied. Our methods directly improve the compilation process of many quantum algorithms, providing optimized circuits. Given the scale of our improvements, for example, quadratic to linear CNOT count for LNN, they will naturally result in a large reduction of errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) in the context of photonic quantum computing. QCBMs are a popular choice of quantum generative machine learning models, and we present a QCBM designed for linear optics. We show that a recently developed error mitigation technique called recycling mitigation greatly improves the training of QCBMs in realistic scenarios with photon loss, which is the primary source of noise in photonic systems. We demonstrate this through numerical simulations and through an experiment on a quantum photonic integrated processor. We expect our work to pave the way towards more demonstrations of error mitigation techniques tailored to photonic devices which can enhance the performance of a quantum algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) are energy bands with zero group velocity, which in electronic systems were shown to favor strongly correlated phenomena. Indeed, a FB can be spanned with a basis of strictly localized states, the so called "compact localized states" (CLSs), which are yet generally non-orthogonal. Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters dispersively coupled to the photonic analogue of a FB, a setup within reach in state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local atom-field coupling) allows to tailor interaction potentials having the same shape of a CLS or a superposition of a few of these.</description>

Abstract: An important and difficult problem in optimization is the high-order unconstrained binary optimization, which can represent many optimization problems more efficient than quadratic unconstrained binary optimization, but how to quickly solve it has remained difficult. Here we present an approach by mapping the high-order unconstrained binary optimization to quantum Z2 lattice gauge theory defined on the dual graph, and propose the gauged local quantum annealing, which is the local quantum annealing protected by the gauge symmetry. We present the quantum algorithm and its corresponding quantum-inspired classical algorithm for this problem, and achieve algorithmic speedup by using gauge symmetry. By running the quantum-inspired classical algorithm, we demonstrate that the gauged local quantum annealing reduces the computational time by one order of magnitude from that of the local quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Repeater-Like Asynchronous Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Conference Key Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum conference key agreement enables secure communication among multiple parties by leveraging multipartite entanglement, which is expected to play a crucial role in future quantum networks. However, the practical application of this technology has been severely limited by the experimental complexity and low efficiency associated with the requirement for synchronous detection of multipartite entangled states. In this work, we propose a measurement-device-independent quantum conference key agreement protocol that employs asynchronous Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state measurement. Our protocol enables a linear scaling of the conference key rate among multiple parties, demonstrating performance comparable to that of the single-repeater scheme in quantum networks. Additionally, we achieve intercity transmission distances with composable security under finite-key conditions. By adopting the generalized asynchronous pairing strategy, our approach eliminates the need for complex global phase locking techniques. Furthermore, by integrating asynchronous pairing with ring-interference network structure, our method provides insights for various quantum tasks beyond quantum communication, such as multiparty computing and quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>A Randomized Method for Simulating Lindblad Equations and Thermal State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a qDRIFT-type randomized method to simulate Lindblad dynamics by decomposing its generator into an ensemble of Lindbladians, $\mathcal{L} = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \mathcal{L}_a$, where each $\mathcal{L}_a$ involves only a single jump operator. Assuming an efficient quantum simulation is available for the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{t\mathcal{L}_a}$, we implement a randomly sampled $\mathcal{L}_a$ at each time step according to a probability distribution $\mu$ over the ensemble $\{\mathcal{L}_a\}_{a \in \mathcal{A}}$. This strategy reduces the quantum cost of simulating Lindblad dynamics, especially in quantum many-body systems with a large or even infinite number of jump operators.
  Our contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the proposed randomized method, covering both average and typical algorithmic realizations. This analysis extends the known results for the random product formula from closed systems to open systems, ensuring rigorous performance guarantees. Second, based on the random product approximation, we derive a new quantum Gibbs sampler algorithm that utilizes jump operators sampled from a Clifford-random circuit. This generator (i) can be efficiently implemented using our randomized algorithm, and (ii) exhibits a spectral gap lower bound that depends on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Our results present a new instance of a class of Hamiltonians for which the thermal state can be efficiently prepared using a quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Light Cones in Long-range Interacting Spin Chains Is Due to Destructive Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on long-range interacting quantum systems, the physical mechanism responsible for the emergence of light cones remains unidentified. This work presents a novel perspective on the origins of locality and emergent light cones in quantum systems with long-range interactions. We identify a mechanism in such spin chains where effective entanglement light cones emerge due to destructive interference among quantum effects that entangle spins. Although long-range entangling effects reach beyond the identified light cone, due to destructive interference, entanglement remains exponentially suppressed in that region, ultimately leading to the formation of the light cone. We demonstrate that this interference not only drives but is also necessary for the emergence of light cones. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that reducing the interaction range weakens this interference, surprisingly increasing the speed of entanglement transport, an effect that opens new experimental opportunities for investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is one of the most promising use cases of future digital quantum computers. In this work we systematically analyze the quantum circuit complexities of block encoding the discretized elliptic operators that arise extensively in numerical simulations for partial differential equations, including high-dimensional instances for many-body simulations. When restricted to rectangular domains with separable boundary conditions, we provide explicit circuits to block encode the many-body Laplacian with separable periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions, using standard discretization techniques from low-order finite difference methods. To obtain high-precision, we introduce a scheme based on periodic extensions to solve Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems using a high-order finite difference method, with only a constant increase in total circuit depth and subnormalization factor. We then present a scheme to implement block encodings of differential operators acting on more arbitrary domains, inspired by Cartesian immersed boundary methods. We then block encode the many-body convective operator, which describes interacting particles experiencing a force generated by a pair-wise potential given as an inverse power law of the interparticle distance. This work provides concrete recipes that are readily translated into quantum circuits, with depth logarithmic in the total Hilbert space dimension, that block encode operators arising broadly in applications involving the quantum simulation of quantum and classical many-body mechanics.</description>

      <title>Topological transitions in quantum jump dynamics: Hidden exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.</description>

      <title>Scalable parallel measurement of individual nitrogen-vacancy centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a solid-state spin defect that has been widely adopted for quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Typically, experiments are performed either with a single isolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting in a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over individual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that bypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in parallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on multiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the electronic spin states of over 100 NV centers in parallel. We show that the high signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of shot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 108 NV centers, corresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 5,778 unique correlation coefficients. We discuss how our platform can be scaled to parallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These results enable parallelized high-throughput sensing experiments that retain the nanoscale spatial resolution of single defects, and will thereby help to unlock advances in applications such as single-molecule NMR and characterization of integrated circuits. In addition, our approach to multiplexing provides a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated sensing techniques.</description>

      <title>Momentum-entangled two-photon interference for quantum-limited transverse-displacement estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme achieving the ultimate quantum precision for the estimation of the transverse displacement between two interfering photons. Such a transverse displacement could be caused, for example, by the refracting properties of the propagation medium or by the orientation of a system of mirrors. By performing transverse-momentum sampling interference between polarization-entangled pairs of photons that propagate with different momenta, we show that it is possible to perform transverse-displacement estimation with a precision that increases with the difference of the transverse momenta of the photons. We show that the precision achieved with our scheme is independent of the value of the displacement, useful when tracking a variable displacement. Moreover, only for small displacements, we show that the estimation can be performed without the need for transverse-momentum-resolving detectors. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that it is the quantum interference arising from two-photon entanglement in the transverse momenta at the very heart of the foreseen quantum-limited sensitivity in the spatial domain.</description>

      <title>High purity two-dimensional levitated mechanical oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, levitated optomechanics has delivered on the promise of reaching the motional quantum ground state. An important next milestone of the field would be the generation of mechanical entanglement. An ideal candidate is the two-dimensional motion in the polarization plane of an optical tweezer inside an optical cavity, where optical and mechanical modes are coupled via coherent scattering. Necessary conditions towards this achievement are two-dimensional ground state cooling along with substantial spectral overlap between the two modes. The latter condition is required to generate the necessary correlations, but unfortunately, it hinders efficient cooling thus narrowing the useful parameter space. In this work, we report the achievement of a high purity two-dimensional state in a regime where the strong optomechanical coupling induces the desired spectral superposition between oscillations in different directions, as reflected in the non-trivial spectral shape of the detected cavity field. As a result, significant correlations consistently arise between any pair of orthogonal directions, preventing the motion from being reduced to two independent one-dimensional oscillators and leading to higher purity compared to that scenario. Our system serves as an excellent platform for realizing continuous variable entanglement in two-dimensional motion.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithmic Quantum and Classical Simulations by Corrected Product Formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation using product formulas is arguably the most straightforward and practical approach for algorithmic simulation of a quantum system's dynamics on a quantum computer. Here we present corrected product formulas (CPFs), a variation of product formulas achieved by injecting auxiliary terms called correctors into standard product formulas. We establish several correctors that greatly improve the accuracy of standard product formulas for simulating Hamiltonians comprised of two partitions that can be exactly simulated, a common feature of lattice Hamiltonians, while only adding a small additive or multiplicative factor to the simulation cost. We show that correctors are particularly advantageous for perturbed systems, where one partition has a relatively small norm compared to the other, as they allow the small norm to be utilized as an additional parameter for controlling the simulation error. We demonstrate the performance of CPFs by numerical simulations for several lattice Hamiltonians. Numerical results show our theoretical error bound for CPFs matches or exceeds the empirical error of standard product formulas for these systems. We also demonstrate improvements offered by CPFs by implementation on actual quantum hardware as well as noisy and noiseless quantum simulators. CPFs could be a valuable algorithmic tool for early fault-tolerant quantum computers with limited computing resources. As for standard product formulas, CPFs could also be used for simulations on a classical computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present a low-cost protocol for benchmarking applications on generic quantum hardware in the circuit model. Using families of Clifford circuits which mimic the application circuit structure, we are able to predict how measured expectation value fidelities scale with circuit depth. We consider the specific example of simulating a kicked-Ising model on superconducting hardware, showing our benchmark to be more accurate than predictions which use the gate error data obtained through randomized benchmarking. We also demonstrate how our work can be used to benchmark the performance and limitations of quantum error mitigation techniques. Our method is targeted at applications which have a natural decomposition in terms of Pauli rotations, but can be applied to any input circuit with this decomposition.</description>

      <title>Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces ONDA, a quantum programming language designed to significantly simplify quantum programming by providing multiple abstraction layers similar to those found in classical computing. Unlike traditional quantum programming languages, which primarily focus on circuit construction, ONDA compiles into quantum instructions executed autonomously by specialized quantum hardware, eliminating the need for classical assistance. The proposed architecture uniquely supports sequential execution, branching, and the direct implementation of classical control structures such as conditional statements and loops (e.g., if, do-while) entirely within the quantum domain. By leveraging a quantum microarchitecture that autonomously processes compiled instructions, ONDA facilitates the intuitive implementation of high-level quantum algorithms, reducing complexity and broadening access to quantum programming to promote wider adoption and accelerate advancements in quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems requires the inversion of a linear system of equations, which can be done using a quantum algorithm for matrix inversion arxiv:1806.01838. However, the number of shots required to measure the output of the system can be prohibitive and remove any advantage obtained by quantum computing. In this work we propose a scheme for measuring the output of QSVT matrix inversion algorithms specifically for the CFD use case. We use a Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) based amplitude estimation algorithm arxiv:2207.08628 and show how it can be combined with the QSVT matrix inversion algorithm. We perform a detailed resource estimation of the amount of computational resources required for a single iteration of amplitude estimation, and compare the costs of amplitude estimation with the cost of not doing amplitude estimation and measuring the whole wavefunction. We also propose a measurement scheme to reduce the number of amplitudes measured in the CFD example by focusing on large amplitudes only. We simulate the whole CFD loop, finding that thus measuring only a small number of the total amplitudes in the output vector still results in an acceptable level of overall error.</description>

      <title>FQsun: A Configurable Wave Function-Based Quantum Emulator for Power-Efficient Quantum Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are promising powerful computers for solving complex problems, but access to real quantum hardware remains limited due to high costs. Although the software simulators on CPUs/GPUs such as Qiskit, ProjectQ, and Qsun offer flexibility and support for many qubits, they struggle with high power consumption and limited processing speed, especially as qubit counts scale. Accordingly, quantum emulators implemented on dedicated hardware, such as FPGAs and analog circuits, offer a promising path for addressing energy efficiency concerns. However, existing studies on hardware-based emulators still face challenges in terms of limited flexibility and lack of fidelity evaluation. To overcome these gaps, we propose FQsun, a quantum emulator that enhances performance by integrating four key innovations: efficient memory organization, a configurable Quantum Gate Unit (QGU), optimized scheduling, and multiple number precisions. Five FQsun versions with different number precisions are implemented on the Xilinx ZCU102, consuming a maximum power of 2.41W. Experimental results demonstrate high fidelity, low mean square error, and high normalized gate speed, particularly with 32-bit versions, establishing FQsun's capability as a precise quantum emulator. Benchmarking on famous quantum algorithms reveals that FQsun achieves a superior power-delay product, outperforming software simulators on CPUs in the processing speed range.</description>

      <title>Geometric constructions of generalized dual-unitary circuits from biunitarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing solvable lattice models of chaotic many-body quantum dynamics with multiple unitary directions using biunitary connections. We show that a network of biunitary connections on the Kagome lattice naturally defines a multi-unitary circuit, where three `arrows of time' directly reflect the lattice symmetry. These models unify various constructions of hierarchical dual-unitary and triunitary gates and present new families of models with solvable correlations and entanglement dynamics. Using multilayer constructions of biunitary connections, we additionally introduce multilayer circuits with monoclinic symmetry and higher level hierarchical dual-unitary solvability and discuss their (non-)ergodicity. Our work demonstrates how different classes of solvable models can be understood as arising from different geometric structures in spacetime.</description>

      <title>Testing classical properties from quantum data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properties of Boolean functions can often be tested much faster than the functions can be learned. However, this advantage usually disappears when testers are limited to random samples of a function $f$--a natural setting for data science--rather than queries. In this work we initiate the study of a quantum version of this "data science scenario": quantum algorithms that test properties of $f$ solely from quantum data in the form of copies of the function state $|f\rangle \propto \sum_x|x,f(x)\rangle$.
  $\bullet$ New tests. For three well-established properties--monotonicity, symmetry, and triangle-freeness--we show that the speedup lost when restricting classical testers to sampled data can be recovered by quantum algorithms operating solely from quantum data.
  $\bullet$ Inadequacy of Fourier sampling. Our new testers use techniques beyond quantum Fourier sampling, and we show that this necessary. In particular, there is no constant-complexity tester for symmetry relying solely on Fourier sampling and random classical samples.
  $\bullet$ Classical queries vs. quantum data. We exhibit a testing problem that can be solved from $O(1)$ classical queries but that requires $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ function state copies. The Forrelation problem provides a separation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction, so we conclude that quantum data and classical queries are "maximally incomparable" resources for testing.
  $\bullet$ Towards lower bounds. We also begin the study of lower bounds for testing from quantum data. For quantum monotonicity testing, we prove that the ensembles of Goldreich et al. (2000) and Black (2023), which give exponential lower bounds for classical sample-based testing, do not yield any nontrivial lower bounds for testing from quantum data. New insights specific to quantum data will be required for proving copy complexity lower bounds for testing in this model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum metrology (DQM) enables the estimation of global functions of d distributed parameters beyond the capability of separable sensors. Continuous-variable DQM involves using a linear network with at least one nonclassical input. Here we fully elucidate the structure of linear networks with two non-vacuum inputs which allows us to prove a number of fundamental properties of continuous-variable DQM. While measuring the sum of d parameters at the Heisenberg limit can be achieved with a single non-vacuum input, we show that two inputs, one of which can be classical, is required to measure an arbitrary linear combination of d parameters and an arbitrary global function of the parameters. We obtain a universal and tight upper bound on the sensitivity of DQM networks with two inputs, and completely characterize the properties of the nonclassical input required to obtain a quantum advantage. This reveals that a wide range of nonclassical states make this possible, including a squeezed vacuum. We also show that for a class of nonclassical inputs local photon number detection will achieve the maximum sensitivity. Finally we show that a general DQM network has two distinct regimes. The first achieves Heisenberg scaling. In the second the nonclassical input is much weaker than the coherent input, nevertheless providing a multiplicative enhancement to the otherwise classical sensitivity.</description>

      <title>QuLTSF: Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) involves predicting a large number of future values of a time series based on the past values. This is an essential task in a wide range of domains including weather forecasting, stock market analysis and disease outbreak prediction. Over the decades LTSF algorithms have transitioned from statistical models to deep learning models like transformer models. Despite the complex architecture of transformer based LTSF models `Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting? (Zeng et al., 2023)' showed that simple linear models can outperform the state-of-the-art transformer based LTSF models. Recently, quantum machine learning (QML) is evolving as a domain to enhance the capabilities of classical machine learning models. In this paper we initiate the application of QML to LTSF problems by proposing QuLTSF, a simple hybrid QML model for multivariate LTSF. Through extensive experiments on a widely used weather dataset we show the advantages of QuLTSF over the state-of-the-art classical linear models, in terms of reduced mean squared error and mean absolute error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stern-Gerlach (SG) experiment is a fundamental experiment for revealing the existence of ``spin''. In such an experiment, beams of silver atoms were sent through inhomogeneous magnetic fields to observe their deflection. Thus, the standard SG experiment can be actually viewed as a magnetic-type spin effect. In this work, we successfully generalize the standard SG effect from magnetic-type to electric-type by solving Dirac's equation with a potential barrier, thus revealing an extraordinary spin effect. Beams of Dirac's particles can be regarded as matter waves. Based on Dirac's equation, we obtain the explicit forms of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. The electric-type SG effect shows that the reflected and transmitted waves can have notable spatial shifts, which depend on the spin direction and the incident angle of incident wave. The electric-type SG effect has potential applications to separating Dirac's particles with different spin directions and to estimating the spin direction of Dirac's particles. Some discussions related to the interaction between spin and electric field are also made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We significantly enhance the simulation accuracy of initial Trotter circuits for Hamiltonian simulation of quantum systems by integrating first-order Riemannian optimization with tensor network methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method imposes no symmetry assumptions, such as translational invariance, on the quantum systems. This technique is scalable to large systems through the use of a matrix product operator representation of the reference time evolution propagator. Our optimization routine is applied to various spin chains and fermionic systems, with a particular focus on one-dimensional systems described by the transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the spinful Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian. In these cases, our approach achieves a relative error improvement of up to four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by applying it to molecular systems, specifically lithium hydride, achieving an error improvement of up to eight orders of magnitude. This proof of concept highlights the potential of our approach for broader applications in quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-way quantum computation is a promising approach to achieving universal, scalable, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, a main challenge lies in the creation of universal, scalable three-dimensional cluster states. Here, an experimental scheme is proposed for building large-scale canonical three-dimensional cubic cluster states, which are compatible with the majority of qubit error-correcting codes, using the spatiospectral modes of an optical parametric oscillator. Combining with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, one-way fault-tolerant optical quantum computation can be achieved with a lower fault-tolerant squeezing threshold. Our scheme drastically simplify experimental configurations, paving the way for compact realizations of one-way fault-tolerant optical quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: In this work celebrating the centenary of quantum mechanics, we review the principles of de Broglie Bohm theory, also known as pilot-wave theory and Bohmian mechanics. We assess the most common reading of it (the Nomological interpretation based on the notion of primitive ontology in tridimensional space) and defend instead a more causal and pluralistic approach, drawing on classical analogies with optics and hydrodynamics. Within this framework, we review some of the approaches exploiting mechanical analogies to overcome the limitations of current Bohmian theory and perhaps quantum mechanics itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</description>

Abstract: Whenever an experiment can be described classically, quantum physics must predict the same outcome. Intuitively, there is nothing quantum about an accelerating observer travelling through vacuum. It is, therefore, not surprising that many people are puzzled by the Unruh effect, which predicts that the observer encounters photons in a thermal state. This paper uses a recently introduced local photon approach to show that the quantised electromagnetic field in a non-inertial reference frame can be modelled without violating the principles of general relativity while both observers share a common vacuum. The only difference between a resting and an accelerating observer is that they each experience different worldline densities which implies different zero point energy densities in each reference frame.</description>

      <title>Quantum switches for single-photon routing and entanglement generation in waveguide-based networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interconnection of quantum nodes holds great promise for scaling up quantum computing units and enabling information processing across long-distance quantum registers. Such quantum networks can be realized using superconducting qubits linked by waveguides, which facilitate fast and robust on-demand quantum information exchange via traveling single photons. In this article, we propose leveraging additional qubit degrees of freedom as quantum switches that coherently condition the system dynamics. These switches are implemented using a qubit dispersively coupled to transfer resonators, which mediate interactions between node qubits and quantum links. Through wavepacket shaping techniques, we demonstrate that when the switch is closed, full excitation transfer occurs as a propagating photon, whereas an open switch allows only partial transfer without distorting the shape of the emitted photon. Based on this switch mechanism, we present deterministic protocols for generating entangled states via single-photon routing across the network, such as Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states. The feasibility of our approach is validated through numerical simulations of a three-node network, incorporating decoherence and photon loss effects. Our results indicate that high-fidelity entangled states can be realized employing the proposed quantum switches in current state-of-the-art platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present several analytical approaches to the Dicke superradiance problem, which involves determining the time evolution of the density operator for an initially inverted ensemble of $N$ identical two-level systems undergoing collective spontaneous emission. This serves as one of the simplest cases of open quantum system dynamics that allows for a fully analytical solution. We explore multiple methods to tackle this problem, yielding a solution valid for any time and any number of spins. These approaches range from solving coupled rate equations and identifying exceptional points in non-Hermitian evolution to employing combinatorial and probabilistic techniques, as well as utilizing a quantum jump unraveling of the master equation. The analytical solution is expressed as a residue sum obtained from a contour integral in the complex plane, suggesting the possibility of fully analytical solutions for a broader class of open quantum system dynamics problems.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for a universal digital quantum computer with an application to the Grover-Rudolph algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Thermalization is typical in large classical and quantum harmonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. A different choice of initial conditions, such as all the initial energy localized in a single particle, instead leads to energy equipartition without thermalization. Since the models we consider are integrable, our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on the physical requirement that thermodynamic observables depend on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.</description>

      <title>Zero energy modes with Gaussian, exponential, or polynomial decay: Exact solutions in hermitian and nonhermitian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as Gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schr\"odinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemical Reactions: Achieving Accuracy with NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</description>
