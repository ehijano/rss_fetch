      <title>Message complexity for unary multiautomata systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finitely many two-way automata work independently and synchronously on a unary input. Some of their states are broadcasting, i.e., dispatched to all other automata. At each step of the computation, each automaton changes state and moves right, left or stay in place according to the current state and the possible messages dispatched. The input is recognized if the following occurs: starting from the initial configuration (the heads of all automata are positioned to the left end of the tape) one automaton reaches a final state when its head is positioned to the right end of the tape. We show that if the number of messages sent during the computation is bounded by some integer which is independent of the length of the input, then the language recognized is regular,</description>

      <title>A Logic for Policy Based Resource Exchanges in Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiagent systems autonomous agents interact with each other to achieve individual and collective goals. Typical interactions concern negotiation and agreement on resource exchanges. Modeling and formalizing these agreements pose significant challenges, particularly in capturing the dynamic behaviour of agents, while ensuring that resources are correctly handled. Here, we propose exchange environments as a formal setting where agents specify and obey exchange policies, which are declarative statements about what resources they offer and what they require in return. Furthermore, we introduce a decidable extension of the computational fragment of linear logic as a fundamental tool for representing exchange environments and studying their dynamics in terms of provability.</description>

      <title>L\"ob-Safe Logics for Reflective Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epistemic and doxastic logics are modal logics for knowledge and belief, and serve as foundational models for rational agents in game theory, philosophy, and computer science. We examine the consequences of modeling agents capable of a certain sort of reflection. Such agents face a formal difficulty due to L\"ob's Theorem, called L\"ob's Obstacle in the literature. We show how the most popular axiom schemes of epistemic and doxastic logics suffer from L\"ob's Obstacle, and present two axiom schemes that that avoid L\"ob's Obstacle, which we call Reasonable L\"ob-Safe Epistemic Doxastic logic (${LSED}^R$) and Justified L\"ob-Safe Epistemic Doxastic logic (${LSED}^J$).</description>

      <title>Early Validation of High-level System Requirements with Event Calculus and Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new methodology for early validation of high-level requirements on cyber-physical systems with the aim of improving their quality and, thus, lowering chances of specification errors propagating into later stages of development where it is much more expensive to fix them. The paper presents a transformation of a real-world requirements specification of a medical device$-$a PCA pump$-$into an Event Calculus model that is then evaluated using answer set programming and the s(CASP) system. The evaluation under s(CASP) allowed deductive as well as abductive reasoning about the specified functionality of the PCA pump on the conceptual level with minimal implementation or design dependent influences, and led to fully-automatically detected nuanced violations of critical safety properties. Further, the paper discusses scalability and non-termination challenges that had to be faced in the evaluation and techniques proposed to (partially) solve them. Finally, ideas for improving s(CASP) to overcome its evaluation limitations that still persist as well as to increase its expressiveness are presented.</description>

      <title>Branching Bisimilarity for Processes with Time-outs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an adaptation of branching bisimilarity to reactive systems with time-outs. Multiple equivalent definitions are procured, along with a modal characterisation and a proof of its congruence property for a standard process algebra with recursion. The last section presents a complete axiomatisation for guarded processes without infinite sequences of unobservable actions.</description>

      <title>PREMAP: A Unifying PREiMage APproximation Framework for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most methods for neural network verification focus on bounding the image, i.e., set of outputs for a given input set. This can be used to, for example, check the robustness of neural network predictions to bounded perturbations of an input. However, verifying properties concerning the preimage, i.e., the set of inputs satisfying an output property, requires abstractions in the input space. We present a general framework for preimage abstraction that produces under- and over-approximations of any polyhedral output set. Our framework employs cheap parameterised linear relaxations of the neural network, together with an anytime refinement procedure that iteratively partitions the input region by splitting on input features and neurons. The effectiveness of our approach relies on carefully designed heuristics and optimization objectives to achieve rapid improvements in the approximation volume. We evaluate our method on a range of tasks, demonstrating significant improvement in efficiency and scalability to high-input-dimensional image classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Further, we showcase the application to quantitative verification and robustness analysis, presenting a sound and complete algorithm for the former and providing sound quantitative results for the latter.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Categorical Proof Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These expanded lecture notes are based on a tutorial on categorical proof theory presented at the summer school associated with the conference "Topology, Algebra, and Categories in Logic 2021-2022." The chapter delves into various applications of categorical methods in proof theory. It is designed to be accessible, with no prior familiarity with category theory required. The necessary categorical background is introduced gradually, with a focus on the philosophical and informal aspects of proof. The only prerequisites are a basic understanding of logic, computability theory, topology, and ordered structures.</description>

      <title>Learning Brave Assumption-Based Argumentation Frameworks via ASP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is advocated as a unifying formalism for various forms of non-monotonic reasoning, including logic programming. It allows capturing defeasible knowledge, subject to argumentative debate. While, in much existing work, ABA frameworks are given up-front, in this paper we focus on the problem of automating their learning from background knowledge and positive/negative examples. Unlike prior work, we newly frame the problem in terms of brave reasoning under stable extensions for ABA. We present a novel algorithm based on transformation rules (such as Rote Learning, Folding, Assumption Introduction and Fact Subsumption) and an implementation thereof that makes use of Answer Set Programming. Finally, we compare our technique to state-of-the-art ILP systems that learn defeasible knowledge.</description>

      <title>The fork and its role in unification of closure algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16824v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-pronged fork frame $F$ and the variety $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ generated by its dual closure algebra $B_F$. We describe the finite projective algebras in $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ and give a purely semantic proof that unification in $\mathbf{Eq}(B_F)$ is finitary and not unitary.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of an Abstract Domain of Quantified First-Order Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper lays a practical foundation for using abstract interpretation with an abstract domain that consists of sets of quantified first-order logic formulas. This abstract domain seems infeasible at first sight due to the complexity of the formulas involved and the enormous size of sets of formulas (abstract elements). We introduce an efficient representation of abstract elements, which eliminates redundancies based on a novel syntactic subsumption relation that under-approximates semantic entailment. We develop algorithms and data structures to efficiently compute the join of an abstract element with the abstraction of a concrete state, operating on the representation of abstract elements. To demonstrate feasibility of the domain, we use our data structures and algorithms to implement a symbolic abstraction algorithm that computes the least fixpoint of the best abstract transformer of a transition system, which corresponds to the strongest inductive invariant. We succeed at finding, for example, the least fixpoint for Paxos (which in our representation has 1,438 formulas with $\forall^*\exists^*\forall^*$ quantification) in time comparable to state-of-the-art property-directed approaches.</description>

      <title>A fuzzy loss for ontology classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are often unaware of the inherent constraints of the task they are applied to. However, many downstream tasks require logical consistency. For ontology classification tasks, such constraints include subsumption and disjointness relations between classes.
  In order to increase the consistency of deep learning models, we propose a fuzzy loss that combines label-based loss with terms penalising subsumption- or disjointness-violations. Our evaluation on the ChEBI ontology shows that the fuzzy loss is able to decrease the number of consistency violations by several orders of magnitude without decreasing the classification performance. In addition, we use the fuzzy loss for unsupervised learning. We show that this can further improve consistency on data from a</description>
