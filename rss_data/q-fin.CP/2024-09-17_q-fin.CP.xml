      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Distortion Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</description>

      <title>MoA is All You Need: Building LLM Research Team using Mixture of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) research in the financial domain is particularly complex due to the sheer number of approaches proposed in literature. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the leading methods in the sector due to its inherent groundedness and data source variability. In this work, we introduce a RAG framework called Mixture of Agents (MoA) and demonstrate its viability as a practical, customizable, and highly effective approach for scaling RAG applications. MoA is essentially a layered network of individually customized small language models (Hoffmann et al., 2022) collaborating to answer questions and extract information. While there are many theoretical propositions for such an architecture and even a few libraries for generally applying the structure in practice, there are limited documented studies evaluating the potential of this framework considering real business constraints such as cost and speed. We find that the MoA framework, consisting of small language models (Hoffmann et al., 2022), produces higher quality and more grounded responses across various financial domains that are core to Vanguard's business while simultaneously maintaining low costs.</description>

      <title>Interpolated Drift Implicit Euler MLMC Method for Barrier Option Pricing and application to CIR and CEV Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Giles et al. [14] proved that the efficiency of the Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for evaluating Down-and-Out barrier options for a diffusion process $(X_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ with globally Lipschitz coefficients, can be improved by combining a Brownian bridge technique and a conditional Monte Carlo method provided that the running minimum $\inf_{t\in[0,T]}X_t$ has a bounded density in the vicinity of the barrier. In the present work, thanks to the Lamperti transformation technique and using a Brownian interpolation of the drift implicit Euler scheme of Alfonsi [2], we show that the efficiency of the MLMC can be also improved for the evaluation of barrier options for models with non-Lipschitz diffusion coefficients under certain moment constraints. We study two example models: the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) and the Constant of Elasticity of Variance (CEV) processes for which we show that the conditions of our theoretical framework are satisfied under certain restrictions on the models parameters. In particular, we develop semi-explicit formulas for the densities of the running minimum and running maximum of both CIR and CEV processes which are of independent interest. Finally, numerical tests are processed to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil: Robust backdoor attack via Stochastic investment models and Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of voice-activated systems and speech recognition technologies, the danger of backdoor attacks on audio data has grown significantly. This research looks at a specific type of attack, known as a Stochastic investment-based backdoor attack (MarketBack), in which adversaries strategically manipulate the stylistic properties of audio to fool speech recognition systems. The security and integrity of machine learning models are seriously threatened by backdoor attacks, in order to maintain the reliability of audio applications and systems, the identification of such attacks becomes crucial in the context of audio data. Experimental results demonstrated that MarketBack is feasible to achieve an average attack success rate close to 100% in seven victim models when poisoning less than 1% of the training data.</description>
