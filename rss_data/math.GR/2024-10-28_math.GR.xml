      <title>Groups which are metrically weakly sofic with respect to word norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider metric versions of weak soficity, LEF and residual finiteness. The main results of the paper extend Glebsky and Rivera's characterization of weak soficity to the case of normally finitely generated groups with word metrics. Metric LEF and residual finiteness are also characterized in this class. We deduce that the free group $\mathsf{F}_2$ is not metrically weakly sofic with respect to its standard invariant word norm.</description>

      <title>Finite quotients of Fuchsian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides an effective algorithm for distinguishing finite quotients between two non-isomorphic finitely generated Fuchsian groups $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$. It will suffice to take a finite quotient which is abelian, dihedral, a subgroup of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbf{F}_q)$, or an abelian extension of one of these 3. We will develop an approach for creating group extensions upon a shared finite quotient of $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$ which between them have differing degrees of smoothness. Regarding the order of a finite quotient that distinguishes between $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$, we establish an upperbound as a function of the genera, the number of punctures, and the cone orders arising in $\Gamma$ and $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>On the doubly generalized conjugacy problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the doubly generalized conjugacy problem is decidable for rational subsets of finitely generated virtually free groups: there is an algorithm taking as input two rational subsets $K_1$ and $K_2$ of a virtually free group that decides whether there is one element of $K_1$ conjugate to an element of $K_2$. For free groups, we prove that the same problem is decidable with rational constraints on the set of conjugators.</description>

      <title>On some connections between braces and pre-Lie rings outside of the context of Lazard's correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p&gt;3$ be a prime number and let $A$ be a brace whose additive group is a direct sum of cyclic groups of cardinalities larger than $p^{\alpha }$ for some $\alpha $. Suppose that either (i) $A^{\lfloor{\frac {p-1}4}\rfloor}\subseteq pA$ or that (ii) the additive group of brace $A$ has rank smaller than ${\lfloor{\frac {p-1}4}\rfloor}$. It is shown that for every natural number $i\leq \alpha- {\frac {4\alpha }{p-1}}$ the factor brace $A/p^{i}A$ is obtained by a formula similar to the group of flows from a left nilpotent pre-Lie ring.</description>

      <title>Infinite systems of equations in abelian and nilpotent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every abelian (and even every nilpotent) group contains a solution of any finite unimodular system of equations over itself. However, this is not true for infinite systems. We deduced a criterion for a periodic abelian group to contain a solution of any infinite unimodular system of equations over itself. Using this criterion, we show that nilpotent groups of bounded period also contain solutions of all infinite unimodular systems of equations over themselves. Solvability of every nonsingular infinite system of equations in each divisible nilpotent group is shown as well.</description>

      <title>Classification of the Prime Graphs of $\operatorname{Sz}(8)$-, $\operatorname{Sz}(32)$-, and $\operatorname{PSL}(2, 2^5)$-Solvable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, the vertices of the prime graph $\Gamma(G)$ are the primes that divide $|G|$, and two vertices $p$ and $q$ are connected by an edge if there is an element of order $pq$ in $G$. Prime graphs of solvable groups have been classified, and prime graphs of groups whose noncyclic composition factors are isomorphic to a single nonabelian simple group $T$ have been classified in the case where $T$ has order divisible by exactly three or four distinct primes, except for the cases $T = \operatorname{Sz}(8)$, $T = \operatorname{Sz}(32)$, and $T = \operatorname{PSL}(2,q)$, which in some sense are the hardest cases. In this paper, we complete the classification for $T = \operatorname{Sz}(32)$, $T = \operatorname{Sz}(8)$, and $T = \operatorname{PSL}(2,2^5)$, with the latter two being the first cases ever studied where $|\text{Out}(T)|$ has prime factors which do not divide $|T|$. The groups studied in this paper are also the first ones requiring knowledge of their Brauer character tables to complete the classification task.</description>

      <title>The McKay Conjecture on character degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: McKay's conjecture (1971) on character degrees was reduced by Isaacs-Malle-Navarro (2007) to a so-called inductive condition on characters of finite quasisimple groups [IMN07], thus opening the way to a proof of McKay's conjecture using the classification of finite simple groups. After [Ma07], [Ma08], [S12], [CS13], [KS16], [MS16], [CS17a], [CS17b], [CS19], [S23a], [S23b], we complete here the last step of a proof with an analysis of the representations of certain normalizers ${\mathrm N}_G({\mathbf S})$ in $G={\mathbf G}^F$ of maximal $d$-tori ${\mathbf S}$ ($d\geq 3$) of the ambient simple simply-connected algebraic group ${\mathbf G}$ of type ${\mathrm D}_l$ ($l\geq 4$) for which $F$ is a Frobenius endomorphism. To establish the so-called local conditions A$(d)$ and B$(d)$, we introduce a certain class of $F$-stable reductive subgroups ${\mathbf M}\leq {\mathbf G}$ of maximal rank where ${\mathbf M}^\circ$ is of type ${\mathrm D}_{l_1}\times {\mathrm D}_{l-l_1}$ with ${\mathbf M}/{\mathbf M}^\circ$ of order 2. They are an efficient substitute for ${\mathrm N}_G({\mathbf S})$ or the local subgroups in non-defining characteristic relevant to McKay's abstract statement. For a general class of those subgroups ${\mathbf M}^F$ we describe their characters and the action of $\operatorname {Aut}({\mathbf G}^F)_{{\mathbf M}^F}$ on them, showing in particular that $\mathrm{Irr}({\mathbf M}^F)$ and $\mathrm {Irr}({\mathbf G}^F)$ share some key features in that regard.
  With this established, McKay's conjecture is now a theorem stating $\textit{McKay's equality}$: For any prime $\ell$, any finite group has as many irreducible complex characters of degree prime to $\ell$ as the normalizers of its Sylow $\ell$-subgroups.</description>

      <title>Surfaces proper homotopy equivalent to graphs and their Dehn-Nielsen-Baer maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Algom-Kfir and Bestinva introducing the mapping class group of an infinite graph via proper homotopy equivalences, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a surface to be properly homotopy equivalent to a graph. We consider second-countable orientable surfaces that are possibly infinite-type and have noncompact boundary. For surfaces proper homotopy equivalent to graphs, we explore the basic properties of the induced map between the mapping class groups of the surface and the graph. We view this induced map as the basis of a Dehn-Nielsen-Baer analog in the setting of infinite-type surfaces.</description>

      <title>Thick embeddings into the Heisenberg group and coarse wirings into groups with polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We bound the volume of thick embeddings of finite graphs into the Heisenberg group, as well as the volume of coarse wirings of finite graphs into groups with polynomial growth. This work follows the work of Kolmogorov-Brazdin, Gromov-Guth and Barret-Hume on thick embeddings of graphs (or complexes) into various spaces. We present here a conjecture of Itai Benjamini that suggest that the lower bound of the volume of thick embeddings of finite graphs into locally finite, non-planar, transitive graphs, obtained by the separation profile, is tight. Let $Y$ be a Cayley graph of a group with polynomial growth, we prove that any finite bounded-degree graph $G$ admits a coarse $C\log(1+|G|)$-wiring into $Y$ with the optimal volume suggested by the conjecture. Additionally, for the concrete case where $Y$ is a Cayley graph of the 3 dimensional discrete Heisenberg group, we prove that any finite bounded-degree graph $G$ admits a $1$-thick embedding into $Y$, with optimal volume up to factor $\log^2(1+|G|)$.</description>

      <title>Left-invariant Pseudo-Riemannian metrics on Lie groups: The null cone II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue to study left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metrics on Lie groups being in the null cone of the $O(p,q)$-action using the moving bracket approach. In particular, the Lie algebra being in the null cone implies that the pseudo-Riemannian metric have all vanishing scalar curvature invariants (VSI). We consider \emph{all} Lie algebras of dimension $\leq 6$ and we find that all solvable Lie algebras, and non-trivially Levi-decomposable Lie algebras, of dimension $\leq 6$ are in the null cone, \emph{except} the 3-dimensional solvable Lie algebra $\mathfrak{s}_{3,3}$. For $\mathfrak{g}$ semi-simple, we also give a construction where $\mathfrak{g}\oplus\mathbb{R}^m$ is in the null cone and give examples of such spaces for \emph{all} the real simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$. For example, for the exceptional split groups this construction places the split $\mathfrak{e}_6\oplus\mathbb{R}^6$, split $\mathfrak{e}_7\oplus\mathbb{R}^7$ and split $\mathfrak{e}_8\oplus\mathbb{R}^8$ in the null cone of the $O(42,42)$, $O(70.70)$ and $O(128,128)$ action, respectively, and hence, their corresponding left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metrics are VSI.</description>

      <title>Proper actions of Grigorchuk groups on a CAT(0) cube complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On this paper we will present a construction of a CAT(0) cube complex (an infinite cube), on which the uncountable family of Grigorchuk groups $G_\omega$ act without bounded orbit. Moreover, if the sequence $\omega$ does not contain repetition, we prove that the action is proper and faithful. As a consequence of this result, this cube complex is a model for the classifying space of proper actions for all the groups $G_\omega$ with $\omega$ without repetition. This construction works in a general way for any group acting on a set and which admits a commensurated subset.These examples of non-elliptic actions of infinite finitely generated torsion groups on a non-positively curved cube complex contrast to several established fixed-point theorems concerning actions of torsion groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a topological $G$-space we consider equations with parameters over $G$. In particular we formulate some very general conditions on words with parameters $w(\bar{y},\bar{g})$ over $G$ which guarantee that the inequality $w(\bar{y},\bar{g})\neq 1$ has a solution in $G$. These results are illustrated in some typical situations, in particular standard actions of Thompson's group $F$ and branch groups are considered.
  The major results of this paper appeared in some form in Section 2 of the PhD thesis of the second author (avalable at arXiv:1308.6330).</description>

      <title>Restricted Hausdorff spectra of $q$-adic automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firstly, we completely determine the self-similar Hausdorff spectrum of the group of $q$-adic automorphisms where $q$ is a prime power, answering a question of Grigorchuk. Indeed, we take a further step and completely determine its Hausdorff spectra restricted to the most important subclasses of self-similar groups, providing examples differing drastically from the previously known ones in the literature. Our proof relies on a new explicit formula for the computation of the Hausdorff dimension of closed self-similar groups and a generalization of iterated permutational wreath products.
  Secondly, we provide for every prime $p$ the first examples of just infinite branch pro-$p$ groups with zero Hausdorff dimension in $\Gamma_p$, giving strong evidence against a well-known conjecture of Boston.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\textrm{cd}(G)$ be the set of all complex irreducible character degrees of $G.$ In this paper, we show that if $\textrm{cd}(G)=\textrm{cd}(H),$ where $H$ is a finite simple exceptional group of Lie type, then $G\cong H\times A,$ where $A$ is an abelian group. This completes the verification of Huppert's Conjecture for all finite simple exceptional groups of Lie type.</description>

      <title>On the regularity number of a finite group and other base-related invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-tuple $(H_1, \ldots, H_k)$ of core-free subgroups of a finite group $G$ is said to be regular if $G$ has a regular orbit on the Cartesian product $G/H_1 \times \cdots \times G/H_k$. The regularity number of $G$, denoted $R(G)$, is the smallest positive integer $k$ with the property that every such $k$-tuple is regular. In this paper, we develop some general methods for studying the regularity of subgroup tuples in arbitrary finite groups, and we determine the precise regularity number of all almost simple groups with an alternating or sporadic socle. For example, we prove that $R(S_n) = n-1$ and $R(A_n) = n-2$. We also formulate and investigate natural generalisations of several well-studied problems on base sizes for finite permutation groups, including conjectures due to Cameron, Pyber and Vdovin. For instance, we extend earlier work of Burness, O'Brien and Wilson by proving that $R(G) \leqslant 7$ for every almost simple sporadic group, with equality if and only if $G$ is the Mathieu group ${\rm M}_{24}$. We also show that every triple of soluble subgroups in an almost simple sporadic group is regular, which generalises recent work of Burness on base sizes for transitive actions of sporadic groups with soluble point stabilisers.</description>

      <title>Finite subgroups of the profinite completion of good groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a residually finite, good group of finite virtual cohomological dimension. We prove that the natural monomorphism $G\hookrightarrow\hat{G}$ induces a bijective correspondence between conjugacy classes of finite $p$-subgroups of $G$ and those of its profinite completion $\hat{G}$. Moreover, we prove that the centralizers and normalizers in $\hat{G}$ of finite $p$-subgroups of $G$ are the closures of the respective centralizers and normalizers in $G$. With somewhat more restrictive hypotheses, we prove the same results for finite solvable subgroups of $G$. In the last section, we give a few applications of this theorem to hyperelliptic mapping class groups and virtually compact special toral relatively hyperbolic groups (these include fundamental groups of $3$-orbifolds and of uniform standard arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds).</description>

      <title>The semi-simple theory of higher rank acylindricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new notion of non-positively curved groups: the collection of discrete countable groups acting (AU-)acylindrically on finite products of $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with general type factors. Inspired by the classical theory of ($S$-arithmetic) lattices and the flourishing theory of acylindrically hyperbolic groups, we show that, up to virtual isomorphism, finitely generated groups in this class enjoy a strongly canonical product decomposition. This semi-simple decomposition also descends to the outer-automorphism group, allowing us to give a partial resolution to a recent conjecture of Sela. We also develop various structure results including a free vs abelian Tits' Alternative, and connections to lattice envelopes. Along the way we give representation-theoretic proofs of various results about acylindricity -- some methods are new even in the rank-1 setting.
  The vastness of this class of groups is exhibited by recognizing that it contains, for example, $S$-arithmetic lattices with rank-1 factors, acylindrically hyperbolic groups, HHGs, groups with property (QT), and is closed under direct products, passing to (totally general type) subgroups, and finite index over-groups.</description>

      <title>Embedding the $n$-Qubit Projective Clifford Group into a Symmetric Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a symmetric group ${\rm Sym}_{2(4^n-1)}$, which contains a subgroup isomorphic to the $n$-qubit projective Clifford group $\mathcal{C}_n$. To establish this result, we investigate the centralizers of the $z$ gate and the phase gate within the $n$-qubit projective Clifford group, utilizing the normal form of the Clifford operators. As a byproduct, we also provide a presentation of the inertia subgroup of $\mathcal{C}_n$.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariants of locally compact groups: the homotopical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the classical theory of homotopical $\Sigma$-sets $\Sigma^n$ developed by Bieri, Neumann, Renz and Strebel for abstract groups, to $\Sigma$-sets $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n$ for locally compact Hausdorff groups. Given such a group $G$, our $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$ are sets of continuous homomorphisms $G \to \mathbb{R}$ ("characters"). They match the classical $\Sigma$-sets $\Sigma^n(G)$ if $G$ is discrete, and refine the homotopical compactness properties $\mathrm C_n$ of Abels and Tiemeyer. Moreover, our theory recovers the definition of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^1$ and $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^2$ proposed by Kochloukova.
  Besides presenting various characterizations of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n$ (particularly for $n\in \{1,2\}$), we show that characters in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$ are also in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(H)$ if $H\le G$ is a closed cocompact subgroup, and we generalize several classical results. Namely, we prove that the set of nonzero elements of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$ is open, we prove that characters in a group of type $\mathrm C_n$ that do not vanish on the center always lie in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$, and we relate the $\Sigma$-sets of a group with those of its quotients by closed subgroups of type $\mathrm C_n$. Lastly, we describe how $\Sigma_{\mathrm{top}}^n(G)$ governs whether a closed normal subgroup with abelian quotient is of type $\mathrm C_n$, generalizing one of the highlights of the classical theory.</description>

      <title>Extended Weyl groups, Hurwitz transitivity and weighted projective lines I: Generalities and the tubular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.05083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We start the systematic study of extended Weyl groups, and continue the combinatorial description of thick subcategories in hereditary categories started by Ingalls-Thomas, Igusa-Schiffler-Thomas and Krause. We show that for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ there exists an order preserving bijection between the thick subcategories of $\mathrm{coh}(\mathbb{X})$ generated by an exceptional sequence and a subposet of the interval poset of a Coxeter transformation $c$ in the Weyl group of a simply-laced extended root system if the Hurwitz action is transitive on the reduced reflection factorizations of $c$ that generate the Weyl group. By using combinatorial and group theoretical tools we show that this assumption on the transitivity of the Hurwitz action is fulfilled for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ of tubular type.</description>

      <title>On Bruhat-Tits theory over a higher dimensional base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09431v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a perfect field. Assume that the characteristic of $k$ satisfies certain tameness assumptions \eqref{tameness}. Let $\mathcal O_{_n} := k\llbracket z_{_1}, \ldots, z_{_n}\rrbracket$ and set $K_{_n} := \text{Fract}~\cO_{_n}$. Let $G$ be an almost-simple, simply-connected affine Chevalley group scheme with a maximal torus $T$ and a Borel subgroup $B$. Given a $n$-tuple ${\bf f} = (f_{_1}, \ldots, f_{_n})$ of concave functions on the root system of $G$ as in Bruhat-Tits \cite{bruhattits1}, \cite{bruhattits}, we define {\it {\tt n}-bounded subgroups ${\tt P}_{_{\bf f}}\subset G(K_{_n})$} as a direct generalization of Bruhat-Tits groups for the case $n=1$. We show that these groups are {\it schematic}, i.e. they are valued points of smooth {\em quasi-affine} (resp. {\em affine}) group schemes with connected fibres and {\it adapted to the divisor with normal crossing $z_1 \cdots z_n =0$} in the sense that the restriction to the generic point of the divisor $z_i=0$ is given by $f_i$ (resp. sums of concave functions given by points of the apartment). This provides a higher-dimensional analogue of the Bruhat-Tits group schemes with natural specialization properties. In \S\ref{mixedstuff}, under suitable assumptions on $k$ \S \ref{charassum}, we extend all these results for a $n+1$-tuple ${\bf f} = (f_{_0}, \ldots, f_{_n})$ of concave functions on the root system of $G$ replacing $\mathcal O_{_n}$ by ${\cO} \llbracket x_{_1},\cdots,x_{_n} \rrbracket$ where $\cO$ is a complete discrete valuation ring with a perfect residue field $k$ of characteristic $p$. In the last part of the paper, we give applications in char zero to constructing certain natural group schemes on wonderful embeddings of groups and also certain families of {\tt 2-parahoric} group schemes on minimal resolutions of surface singularities that arose in \cite{balaproc}.</description>

Abstract: We show that for $S$ a closed surface of genus at least $3$, the set of Hitchin representations of $\pi_1(S)$ with image in $\operatorname{SL}(n,\mathbf{Q})$ is dense in the Hitchin component. When $n=2$, we recover a particular case of a result of Takeuchi but using a completely different method.</description>

      <title>Sparsity of stable primes for dynamical sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a dynamical sequence $(f_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ of polynomials over a number field whose set of stable primes is of positive density must necessarily have a very restricted, and in particular ``near-solvable" dynamical Galois group. Together with existing heuristics, our results suggest moreover that a polynomial $f$ all of whose iterates are irreducible modulo a positive density subset of the primes must necessarily be a composition of linear functions, monomials and Dickson polynomials.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative topological boundaries and amenable invariant random intermediate subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an analogue of the topological boundary of discrete groups $\Gamma$, we define the noncommutative topological boundary of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M, \tau)$ and apply it to generalize the main results of [AHO23], showing that for a trace-preserving action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (A, \tau_A)$ on an amenable tracial von Neumann algebra, any $\Gamma$-invariant amenable intermediate subalgebra between $A$ and $\Gamma \ltimes A$ is necessarily a subalgebra of $\mathrm{Rad}(\Gamma) \ltimes A$. By taking $(A, \tau_A) = L^\infty(X, \nu_X)$ for a free pmp action $\Gamma \curvearrowright (X, \nu_X)$, we obtain a similar result for the invariant subequivalence relations of $\mathcal{R}_{\Gamma \curvearrowright X}$.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Binary-Input Multi-Valued Output Optical Cascades for Reversible and Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the decomposition from the group theory based methods of Sasao and Saraivanov to design binary input multivalued output quantum cascades realized with optical NOT, SWAP, and Fredkin Gates. We present this method for 3, 5, and 7 valued outputs, but in general it can be used for odd prime valued outputs. The method can be extended to realize hybrid functions with different valued outputs. A class of local transformations is presented that can simplify the final cascade circuits. Using these simplifying transformations, we present an upper bound on the maximum number of gates in an arbitrary $n$-variable input and $k$-valued output function.</description>
