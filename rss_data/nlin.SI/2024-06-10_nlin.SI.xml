      <title>Hamiltonian formulation and aspects of integrability of generalised hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalised Hydrodynamics (GHD) describes the large-scale inhomogeneous dynamics of integrable (or close to integrable) systems in one dimension of space, based on a central equation for the fluid density or quasi-particle density: the GHD equation. We consider a new, general form of the GHD equation: we allow for spatially extended interaction kernels, generalising previous constructions. We show that the GHD equation, in our general form and hence also in its conventional form, is Hamiltonian. This holds also including force terms representing inhomogeneous external potentials coupled to conserved densities. To this end, we introduce a new Poisson bracket on functionals of the fluid density, which is seen as our dynamical field variable. The total energy is the Hamiltonian whose flow under this Poisson bracket generates the GHD equation. The fluid density depends on two (real and spectral) variables so the GHD equation can be seen as a $2+1$-dimensional classical field theory. We further show the system admits an infinite set of conserved quantities that are in involution for our Poisson bracket, hinting at integrability of this field theory.</description>

      <title>The Lie Group Structure of Elliptic/Hyperelliptic $\wp$ Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generalized dual transformation for elliptic/hyperelliptic $\wp$ functions up to genus three. For the genus one case, from the algebraic addition formula, we deduce that the Weierstrass $\wp$ function has the SO(2,1) $\cong$ Sp(2,$\R$)/$\Z_2$ Lie group structure. For the genus two case, by constructing a quadratic invariant form, we find that hyperelliptic $\wp$ functions have the SO(3,2) $\cong$ Sp(4,$\R$)/$\Z_2$ Lie group structure. Making use of quadratic invariant forms reveals that hyperelliptic $\wp$ functions with genus three have the SO(9,6) Lie group and/or it's subgroup structure.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian octahedron recurrence (dSKP equation) I: explicit solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an explicit expression for the solutions of the discrete Schwarzian octahedron recurrence, also known as the discrete Schwarzian KP equation (dSKP), as the ratio of two partition functions. Each one counts weighted oriented dimer configurations of an associated bipartite graph, and is equal to the determinant of a Kasteleyn matrix. This is in the spirit of Speyer's result on the dKP equation, or octahedron recurrence [Spe07]. One consequence is that dSKP has zero algebraic entropy, meaning that the growth of the degrees of the polynomials involved is only polynomial. There are cancellations in the partition function, and we prove an alternative, cancellation free explicit expression involving complementary trees and forests. Using all of the above, we show several instances of the Devron property for dSKP, i.e., that certain singularities in initial data repeat after a finite number of steps. This has many applications for discrete geometric systems and is the subject of the companion paper [AdTM22]. We also prove limit shape results analogous to the arctic circle of the Aztec diamond. Finally, we discuss the combinatorics of all the other octahedral equations in the classification of Adler, Bobenko and Suris [ABS12].</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian octahedron recurrence (dSKP equation) II: geometric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nine geometric systems: Miquel dynamics, P-nets, integrable cross-ratio maps, discrete holomorphic functions, orthogonal circle patterns, polygon recutting, circle intersection dynamics, (corrugated) pentagram maps and the short diagonal hyperplane map. Using a unified framework, for each system we prove an explicit expression for the solution as a function of the initial data; more precisely, we show that the solution is equal to the ratio of two partition functions of an oriented dimer model on an Aztec diamond whose face weights are constructed from the initial data. Then, we study the Devron property [Gli15], which states the following: if the system starts from initial data that is singular for the backwards dynamics, this singularity is expected to reoccur after a finite number of steps of the forwards dynamics. Again, using a unified framework, we prove this Devron property for all of the above geometric systems, for different kinds of singular initial data. In doing so, we obtain new singularity results and also known ones [Gli15, Yao14]. Our general method consists in proving that these nine geometric systems are all related to the Schwarzian octahedron recurrence (dSKP equation), and then to rely on the companion paper [AdTM22], where we study this recurrence in general, prove explicit expressions and singularity results.</description>

      <title>Solitary cluster waves in periodic potentials: Formation, propagation, and soliton-mediated particle transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport processes in crowded periodic structures are often mediated by cooperative movements of particles forming clusters. Recent theoretical and experimental studies of driven Brownian motion of hard spheres showed that cluster-mediated transport in one-dimensional periodic potentials can proceed in form of solitary waves. We here give a comprehensive description of these solitons. Fundamental for our analysis is a static presoliton state, which is formed by a periodic arrangement of basic stable clusters. Their size follows from a geometric principle of minimum free space. Adding one particle to the presoliton state gives rise to solitons. We derive the minimal number of particles needed for soliton formation, number of solitons at larger particle numbers, soliton velocities and soliton-mediated particle currents. Incomplete relaxations of the basic clusters are responsible for an effective repulsive soliton-soliton interaction seen in measurements. A dynamical phase transition is predicted to occur in current-density relations at low temperatures. Our results provide a theoretical basis for describing experiments on cluster-mediated particle transport in periodic potentials.</description>
