      <title>A hierarchical splines-based $h$-adaptive isogeometric solver for all-electron Kohn--Sham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel $h$-adaptive isogeometric solver utilizing high-order hierarchical splines is proposed to solve the all-electron Kohn--Sham equation. In virtue of the smooth nature of Kohn--Sham wavefunctions across the domain, except at the nuclear positions, high-order globally regular basis functions such as B-splines are well suited for achieving high accuracy. To further handle the singularities in the external potential at the nuclear positions, an $h$-adaptive framework based on the hierarchical splines is presented with a specially designed residual-type error indicator, allowing for different resolutions on the domain. The generalized eigenvalue problem raising from the discretized Kohn--Sham equation is effectively solved by the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method with an elliptic preconditioner, and it is found that the eigensolver's convergence is independent of the spline basis order. A series of numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the $h$-adaptive framework, with a notable experiment that the numerical accuracy $10^{-3} \mathrm{~Hartree/particle}$ in the all-electron simulation of a methane molecule is achieved using only $6355$ degrees of freedom, demonstrating the competitiveness of our solver for the all-electron Kohn--Sham equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe efficient differentiation methods for computing Jacobians and gradients of a large class of matrix functions including the matrix logarithm $\log(A)$ and $p$-th roots $A^{\frac{1}{p}}$. We exploit contour integrals and conformal maps as described by (Hale et al., SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 2008) for evaluation and differentiation and analyze the computational complexity as well as numerical accuracy compared to high accuracy finite difference methods. As a demonstrator application we compute properties of structural defects in silicon crystals at positive temperatures, requiring efficient and accurate gradients of matrix trace-logarithms.</description>

      <title>A Multigrid Graph U-Net Framework for Simulating Multiphase Flow in Heterogeneous Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of multi-phase fluid dynamics in porous media is critical to a variety of geoscience applications. Data-driven surrogate models using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise but are constrained to regular Cartesian grids and struggle with unstructured meshes necessary for accurately modeling complex geological features in subsurface simulations.
  To tackle this difficulty, we build surrogate models based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate space-time solutions of multi-phase flow and transport processes. Particularly, a novel Graph U-Net framework, referred to as AMG-GU, is developed to enable hierarchical graph learning for the parabolic pressure component of the coupled partial differential equation (PDE) system. Drawing inspiration from aggregation-type Algebraic Multigrid (AMG), we propose a graph coarsening strategy adapted to heterogeneous PDE coefficients, achieving an effective graph pooling operation.
  Results of three-dimensional heterogeneous test cases demonstrate that the multi-level surrogates predict pressure and saturation dynamics with high accuracy, significantly outperforming the single-level baseline. Our Graph U-Net model exhibits great generalization capability to unseen model configurations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Catalyst Design: A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Electrocatalytic Performance in Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to sustainable green hydrogen production demands innovative electrocatalyst design strategies that can overcome current technological limitations. This study introduces a comprehensive data-driven approach to predicting and understanding catalytic performance for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) using advanced machine learning methodologies. By usimg a dataset of 16,226 data points from the Catalysis-hub database, we developed a novel stacking ensemble model that integrates Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Regression to predict Gibbs free energy of adsorption across diverse bimetallic alloy surfaces. Our innovative feature engineering strategy combined Matminer-based compositional analysis, Principal Component Analysis for adsorption site related features, and correlation screening to generate robust predictive descriptors. The machine learning model demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities, achieving R^2 values of 0.98 for HER and 0.94 for OER, with Mean Absolute Error values of 0.251 and 0.121, respectively. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis revealed critical insights into the complex interplay of compositional, structural, and electronic features governing catalytic performance. The research provides a powerful computational framework for accelerating electrocatalyst design, offering unprecedented insights into the fundamental properties that drive hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. By bridging advanced machine learning techniques with fundamental electrochemical principles, this study presents a transformative approach to developing cost-effective, high-performance catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Discover Physical Concepts and Equations with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can uncover physical concepts or physical equations when prior knowledge from another one is available. However, in many cases, these two aspects are coupled and cannot be discovered independently. We extend SciNet, which is a neural network architecture that simulates the human physical reasoning process for physics discovery, by proposing a model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). This allows us to simultaneously discover physical concepts and governing equations from simulated experimental data across diverse physical systems. We apply the model to several key examples inspired by the history of physics, including Copernicus' heliocentric solar system, Newton's law of universal gravitation, the wave function together with the Schr\"odinger equation, and spin-1/2 along with the Pauli equation. The results demonstrate that the neural network successfully reconstructs the corresponding theories.</description>

      <title>Numerical Solution Partial Differential Equations using the Discrete Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explain how to use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). We start by defining appropriate discrete domains in coordinate and frequency domains. Then describe the main limitation of the method arising from the Sampling Theorem, which defines the critical Nyquist frequency and the aliasing effect. We then define the Fourier Transform (FT) and the FFT in a way that can be implemented in one and more dimensions. Finally, we show how to apply the FFT in the solution of PDEs related to problems involving two spatial dimensions, specifically the Poisson equation, the diffusion equation and the wave equation for elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic cases respectively.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, a novel particle merging scheme is proposed for PIC-DSMC simulations, based on the solution of a Non-negative Least Squares problem. The merging algorithm conserves arbitrary moments of the velocity distribution function, and a collision rate-conserving version of the algorithm is presented as well.

      <title>A flexible framework for large-scale FDTD simulations: open-source inverse design for 3D nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient open-source python package for the inverse design of three-dimensional photonic nanostructures using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. Leveraging a flexible reverse-mode automatic differentiation implementation, our software enables gradient-based optimization over large simulation volumes. Gradient computation is implemented within the JAX framework and based on the property of time reversibility in Maxwell's equations. This approach significantly reduces computational time and memory requirements compared to traditional FDTD methods. Gradient-based optimization facilitates the automatic creation of intricate three-dimensional structures with millions of design parameters, which would be infeasible to design manually. We demonstrate the scalability of the solver from single to multiple GPUs through several inverse design examples, highlighting its robustness and performance in large-scale photonic simulations. In addition, the package features an object-oriented and user-friendly API that simplifies the specification of materials, sources, and constraints. Specifically, it allows for intuitive positioning and sizing of objects in absolute or relative coordinates within the simulation scene. By rapid specification of the desired design properties and rapid optimization within the given user constraints, this open-source framework aims to accelerate innovation in photonic inverse design. It yields a powerful and accessible computational tool for researchers, applicable in a wide range of use cases, including but not limited to photonic waveguides, active devices, and photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Neural Canonical Transformations for Quantum Anharmonic Solids of Lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium is a typical quantum solid, characterized by cubic structures at ambient pressure. As the pressure increases, it forms more complex structures and undergoes a metal-to-semiconductor transformation, complicating theoretical and experimental analyses. We employ the neural canonical transformation approach, an \textit{ab initio} variational method based on probabilistic generative models, to investigate the quantum anharmonic effects in lithium solids at finite temperatures. This approach combines a normalizing flow for phonon excited-state wave functions with a probabilistic model for the occupation of energy levels, optimized jointly to minimize the free energy. Our results indicate that quantum anharmonicity lowers the \textit{bcc}-\textit{fcc} transition temperature compared to classical molecular dynamics predictions. At high pressures, the predicted fractional coordinates of lithium atoms in the \textit{cI16} structure show good quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Finally, contrary to previous beliefs, we find that the poor metallic \textit{oC88} structure is stabilized by the potential energy surface obtained via high-accuracy electronic structure calculations, rather than thermal or quantum nuclear effects.</description>

      <title>Emergent Equilibrium in All-Optical Single Quantum-Trajectory Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of multi-mode optical systems driven by two-photon processes and subject to non-local losses, incorporating quantum noise at the Gaussian level. Our findings show that the statistics retrieved from a single Gaussian quantum trajectory exhibits emergent thermal equilibrium governed by an Ising Hamiltonian, encoded in the dissipative coupling between modes. The system's effective temperature is set by the driving strength relative to the oscillation threshold. Given the ultra-short time scales typical of all-optical devices, our study demonstrates that such multi-mode optical systems can operate as ultra-fast Boltzmann samplers, paving the way towards the realization of efficient hardware for combinatorial optimization, with promising applications in machine learning and beyond.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolving Normalising Flows for Lattice Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a renormalisation group inspired normalising flow that combines benefits from traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and standard normalising flows to sample lattice field theories. Specifically, we use samples from a coarse lattice field theory and learn a stochastic map to the targeted fine theory. The devised architecture allows for systematic improvements and efficient sampling on lattices as large as $128 \times 128$ in all phases when only having sampling access on a $4\times 4$ lattice. This paves the way for reaping the benefits of traditional MCMC methods on coarse lattices while using normalising flows to learn transformations towards finer grids, aligning nicely with the intuition of super-resolution tasks. Moreover, by optimising the base distribution, this approach allows for further structural improvements besides increasing the expressivity of the model.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the N\'eel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the N\'eel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and weak electronic correlations in Kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one class of typical quantum materials, Kagome metals in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) have attracted extensive attentions due to their interesting physical properties and different quantum phases of charge density wave (CDW), superconductivity and nontrivial topology. Recently, a new CDW phase in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ was experimentally observed and inspired a wide study of the mechanism of driving force. To have a clear understanding of the correlation effect in the CDW phase in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, we performed a systematic density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory (DFT + DMFT) calculations. The resulting static local spin susceptibility is nearly independent of temperature, indicating the absence of local moment on atom V, in full agreement with experimental measurements. The mass enhancements of quasiparticles and
  bandwidth renormalizations near the Fermi level show a weak correlation strength in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. In addition, the comparable mass enhancements of quasiparticles in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ with CDW order and YV$_6$Sn$_6$ without CDW phase suggests that electronic correlations corresponding to Fermi surface nesting do not play the dominant role in the formation of CDW order in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$.</description>

      <title>DiFfRG: A Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiFfRG (Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows), a comprehensive computational C++ framework for solving functional Renormalisation Group flows in very general truncation schemes. Its central features are threefold: Firstly, the use of Finite Element Methods (FEM) for efficient, easy to set up and quantitatively reliable computations of field dependences. Secondly, the (simultaneous) setup of large, fully momentum-dependent vertex expansions. Thirdly, efficient time-discretisation methods, incorporating insights from studies of solving theories which exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking, going hand in hand with shocks and an exponential increase of the information flow velocity in field space. The framework provides a Mathematica package for automatic code generation of flow equations, finite and zero temperature integration routines with support for GPU hardware and extensive parallelisation capabilities. Detailed examples and tutorials are provided and discussed herein which showcase and introduce the framework to the user. We illustrate the capabilities of DiFfRG with four examples, with the complete codes fully included: finite temperature O(N) theory, a Quark-Meson model, SU(3) Yang-Mills theory and four-Fermi flows in the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Effects of Magnetic Focusing on Power and Stability of VE Amplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory and modeling of new discovered effects of the oscillating e-beam boundary formed in a magnetic focusing channel on the stability, gain, and power of VE amplifiers are presented. The RF structure and e-beam circuit parameters are computed for different beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes and then the self-excitation thresholds are obtained from the Determinant equations. A new solution of the beam envelope equation not limited by the small-amplitude oscillations is derived and used to determine the magnetic focusing conditions providing various beam envelope radii and oscillation amplitudes. It is shown for the example Ka-band serpentine structure that the optimum radius as well as axial position of the oscillating beam envelope allow achieving significantly greater gain and power of RF amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining bistability with the Martini force field</title>

Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time and length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22870</link>

Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>A Note on Hyperbolic Relaxation of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system for incompressible two-phase flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-phase dynamics of two incompressible and immiscible fluids. As a mathematical model we rely on the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system that belongs to the class of diffuse-interface models. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system exhibit strong non-local effects due to the velocity divergence constraint and the fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard operator. We suggest a new first-order approximative system for the inviscid sub-system. It relies on the artificial-compressibility ansatz for the Navier-Stokes equations, a friction-type approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and a relaxation of a third-order capillarity term. We show under reasonable assumptions that the first-order operator within the approximative system is hyperbolic; precisely we prove for the spatially one-dimensional case that it is equipped with an entropy-entropy flux pair with convex (mathematical) entropy. For specific states we present a numerical characteristic analysis. Thanks to the hyperbolicity of the system, we can employ all standard numerical methods from the field of hyperbolic conservation laws. We conclude the paper with preliminary numerical results in one spatial dimension.</description>
