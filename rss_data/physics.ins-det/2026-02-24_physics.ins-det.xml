      <title>Cold Neutron Imaging and Efficiency Measurements with a Boron-10 Coated Double-GEM Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A B-10 coated GEM neutron detector (BGEM) was developed as a He-3 free alternative for cold-neutron beamline instrumentation, employing a single B4C converter cathode, a double-GEM amplification stage, and an orthogonal strip readout over an active area of 10 x 10 cm^2. Performance was evaluated at the Bio-REF cold-neutron beamline of the HANARO research reactor using a monochromatic 4.5 {\angstrom} beam (En = 4.03 meV). The absolute detection efficiency, measured relative to a calibrated Li-6 based Ce:LiCAF scintillation detector, was {\epsilon}BGEM = 8.69 +/- 0.20 % (stat.). The spatial resolution was estimated from the edge smearing of reconstructed images of 1 mm diameter Cd-mask holes via an error-function fit to the radial edge profile, yielding approximately 700 {\mu}m. These results demonstrate stable cold-neutron operation of a single converter BGEM detector and provide a baseline for further efficiency improvements via converter and geometry optimization.</description>

      <title>Designing electrostatic MEMS-based electron optics: the case of the spiral phase plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new generation of microfabricated MEMS for electron optics is changing electron microscopy for the better. These devices allow operations on the electron beam that are impossible with conventional electron optics. Unprecedented phase landscapes like tunable spiral phase plates and localized strong phase gradients are just some examples of what can be achieved. This work establishes the methodological foundation to design and control MEMS based phase plates. The design strategy is rooted on a novel analytical and numerical modeling of thin electrodes with accurate account of the fringing fields having a major role in the thin-MEMS geometry. We designed, fabricated and characterized experimentally a spiral phase plate, and assessed the quality of the generated vortex beam while discussing the most relevant control parameters and design approaches.</description>

      <title>Test-beam results from MiniCACTUS-v2: A depleted monolithic CMOS timing sensor prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MiniCACTUS-v2 is a monolithic sensor prototype designed in LF 150 nm CMOS process for time tagging of individual Minimum Ionizing Particles with an accuracy better than 100 ps. The sensing element is a deep n-well/p-substrate diode without internal amplification. To minimize detector capacitances, the analog front-ends and the discriminators for each pixel have been implemented outside the pixel, at the column level. After fabrication, the sensors have been thinned to 150 microns, 175 microns and 200 microns and then post-processed for backside biasing. The breakdown voltages measured on these sensors are higher than 500 V, ensuring the complete depletion of the charge collection volume. In this paper, we will focus on the time resolution measurements from a test-beam campaign conducted in July 2025 at SPS-CERN. During this period, several pixels from the 3 different sensor thicknesses have been tested at different bias voltages. The best time resolution measured is 48.88 ps on a 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm pixel from a 175 microns-thick sensor at 500 V, with nominal settings for the on-chip analog front-end and discriminator.</description>

      <title>Development of a Cherenkov-Based Time-of-Flight Detector Using Silicon Photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to develop high precision Time-of-Flight (TOF) devices based on high refractive index solid Cherenkov radiators read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Cherenkov light is prompt and therefore ideal for reaching the intrinsic timing limits of TOF systems. By utilizing a thin, high-refractive-index radiator a nearly instantaneous signal is generated by particles exceeding the Cherenkov threshold. In order to achieve the ultimate time resolution, we carried out a rigorous optimization of the radiator material and geometry, alongside the efficiency of the optical coupling to the SiPM sensors. The key factors limiting the time resolution were characterized by comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, subsequently validated against experimental beam test data. We assembled small-scale prototypes instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM arrays sensors with pitches ranging from 1.3 to 3 mm coupled with various window materials, such as fused silica and MgF2, featuring various thickness values. The prototypes were successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN-PS T10 beam line. The data were collected with a complete chain of front-end and readout electronics based on either the Petiroc 2A or the Radioroc 2 interfaced to a picoTDC to measure charges and times. By comparing the time measurements with two SiPM arrays we were able to measure a time resolution better than 33.2 ps at the full system level with a charged particle detection efficiency of 100%. Our results demonstrate the expected performance benchmarks for the charged particle detection efficiency and time resolution and highlight the potential of the developed Cherenkov-based TOF detectors for next-generation particle identification systems.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Superconducting Proximity Effect in S-S'-S Transition Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximity effects at superconducting interfaces, between different superconductors (S-S') or between superconductors and normal metals (S-N), are fundamental to the performance of superconducting electronics, yet only few experiments have directly probed the spatial structure of proximity effects within a device. This is particularly relevant for transition edge sensors (TESs), where the interplay of direct and inverse proximity effects governs detector sensitivity. Here, we use scanning superconducting interference device (SQUID) susceptometry to directly image the local diamagnetic response in functional S-S'-S TES structures. We resolve long range proximity coupling extending over tens of micrometers, revealing that the local transition temperature is dramatically tuned by neighboring regions, being either enhanced by superconducting (S) leads or suppressed by normal metal (N) contacts. Our observations are quantitatively supported by Ginzburg Landau modeling of the device geometry and calculations of the temperature dependent diamagnetism based on self-consistent Usadel equations. By providing spatially resolved measurements of the interplay of proximity effects in TES devices, this work establishes a framework for understanding and controlling superconducting states in heterogeneous superconducting structures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole-dipole transition for scintillation quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11361v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A magnetic dipole-dipole interaction is proposed as a scintillation quenching mechanism. The interaction rate follows $R^{-6}$ as the electric dipole-dipole interaction in F$\mathrm{\ddot{o}}$ster resonance energy transfer theory. The proposed mechanism causes a long-range resonance energy transfer, and the resonance condition is that the spins of donor and acceptor electrons both flip, and the energy level differences are the same. The new mechanism is distinct to the known spin-orbit coupling induced intersystem crossing, and it can enhance the overall intersystem crossing rate. When oxygen or organic molecules including heavy elements are dissolved in a liquid scintillator, these requirements are possible to be satisfied. The proposal in the paper adds a new approach for scintillation quenching in liquid scintillators.</description>

      <title>Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques. Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of the long-term annealing behavior of neutron irradiated diodes from 8-inch p-type silicon wafers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To face the higher levels of radiation due to the 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity during the High-Luminosity LHC, the CMS detector will replace the current Calorimeter Endcap (CE) using the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) concept. The high-radiation regions of the the CE, where fluences between $1\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and doses of up to 2\,MGy are expected considering an integrated luminosity of $3\,ab^{-1}$, will be equipped with silicon pad sensors. This includes the entire electromagnetic as well as parts of the hadronic section of the CE. The silicon sensors are processed on 8-inch p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300\,\textmu m, 200\,\textmu m and 120\,\textmu m and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the full wafer area and tiling. With each main sensor, several small test structures (e.g. pad diodes) are hosted on the wafers, used for quality assurance and radiation hardness tests. In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with reactor neutrons at JSI (Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia) to fluences between $5\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1.5\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. This study focuses on the isothermal annealing behavior of the bulk material at different temperatures between 5.5{\deg}C and 60{\deg}C using electrical characterization and charge collection measurements. The results are used to extract the annealing time constants for this material and fluence range based on the Hamburg model approach to allow an estimation of the expected annealing effects in silicon sensors during the year-end technical stops and the long HL-LHC shutdowns. The annealing parameters found will make it possible to model the annealing behavior of p-type silicon detector projects at HL-LHC fluence ranges better than the existing Hamburg model.</description>

      <title>A compact Optical Liquid Argon Facility at Roma Tre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a compact test facility for the measurement of optical properties of liquid argon as scintillator. The setup is under preparation at Roma Tre and it has a volume of 40 L liquid argon, which is liquefied from argon gas with a purity of $\ge 99.9999\%$ vol. To readout the scintillation photons from liquid argon with the highest intensity near 127 nm, we use the vacuum ultraviolet silicon photomultipliers from Hamamatsu. By submerging the photon detectors directly inside the liquid argon, we can eliminate the systematics from the wavelength shifter and light guides which have been commonly used to detect the scintillation photons of liquid argon.</description>

      <title>Direct in-chamber radon-220 (thoron) emanation measurements for rare-event physics experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring radon emanation from detector materials is a key method for controlling radon, a significant background in rare-event physics experiments. Methods for measuring radon emanation are well-established but have predominantly focused on the 222Rn isotope, the dominant radon isotope for these backgrounds. However, measurements of 220Rn (thoron), the second most abundant radon isotope, remain relatively unexplored. 220Rn emanation measurements are challenging because the 220Rn must be transferred from the emanation chamber to the active detector within its short 55 s half-life. In this study, a direct in-chamber approach for measuring 220Rn emanation is presented in which the sample is placed directly within the active detector chamber, thereby minimising losses during transfer. The method was demonstrated with a DURRIDGE RAD8 electrostatic radon detector, which measured 220Rn emanation from low-activity thoriated rods with an activity of 76 +/- 20 mBq. Compared with a conventional flowthrough 220Rn emanation setup, the in-chamber method increased sensitivity by a factor of 3. Using helium as the carrier gas provided a further sensitivity increase, giving an overall sensitivity gain of ~5. These results indicate that in-chamber 220Rn emanation measurements provide an effective tool for low-background experiments and have the potential to accelerate radon studies by exploiting the shorter half-life of 220Rn.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency pulse design in local rotating frame in magnetic resonance imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of spatially selective radio-frequency (RF) pulse design in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically stated in the form of determining, analytically or numerically, RF waveforms to be applied in synchrony with one or more predetermined gradient waveforms. In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit. In all, the proposed framework provides considerable theoretical insights and practical utility for RF pulse design in MRI.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation on a single channel for resistance noise measurements</title>

Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.
  Cross-correlation is an established tool to reduce the background in resistance noise measurements. However, the conventional method requires the amplifier, demodulator and digitizer channels to be duplicated, increasing the cost and complexity of the measurement circuit. We propose an alternating-current technique that allows cross-correlation with only a single channel by modulating the device under test with two carrier frequencies simultaneously. Using multiple software-based demodulators, we show that this method produces accurate amplitude measurements and noise spectra. The signal-to-noise-ratio is improved by 7 dB, and longer measurement durations increase this improvement.</description>

      <title>On-chip probabilistic inference for charged-particle tracking at the sensor edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern scientific instruments operate under increasingly extreme constraints on bandwidth, latency, and power. Inference at the sensor edge determines experimental data collection efficiency by deciding which information to save for further analysis. Particle tracking detectors at the Large Hadron Collider exemplify this challenge: pixelated silicon sensors generate rich spatiotemporal ionization patterns, yet most of this information is discarded due to data-rate limitations. Concurrently, advancements in co-design tools provide rapid turn-around for incorporating machine learning into application-specific integrated circuits, motivating designs for particle detectors with new integrated technologies. We demonstrate that neural networks embedded in the front-end electronics can infer charged-particle kinematic parameters from a single silicon layer. We regress hit positions and incident angles with calibrated uncertainties, while satisfying stringent constraints on numerical precision, latency, and silicon area. Our results establish a path toward probabilistic inference directly at the edge, opening new opportunities for intelligent sensing in high-rate scientific instruments.</description>

      <title>Characterization of an MPPC-Based Scintillator Telescope and Measurement of Cosmic Muon Angular Distribution</title>

Abstract: This report presents the design, characterization, and application of a high-sensitivity optical detection system based on plastic scintillators coupled to Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs). The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\bm{\cos^n(\theta)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\bm{n = 1.44 \pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the MPPC-scintillator coupling for precise photon counting and timing applications in high-energy physics instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Letter Of Intent for a future $\mu^+ \to \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ experiment at the High Intensity Muon Beam facility at PSI</title>

Abstract: Searches for charged lepton flavor violation in the muon sector stand out among the most sensitive and clean probes for physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, $\mu^+ \to \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ experiments provide the best constraints in this field for a wide range of models while, in the coming years, new experiments investigating the processes of $\mu^+ \to \mathrm{e}^+ \mathrm{e}^+ \mathrm{e}^-$ and $\mu \to \mathrm{e}$ conversion in the nuclear field are anticipated to reach comparable or higher sensitivities. The High-Intensity Muon Beam (HIMB) facility at PSI, which is expected to deliver muon beam intensities up to two orders of magnitude higher than the existing beam lines, offers a unique opportunity to significantly enhance the sensitivity of $\mu^+ \to \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ searches. The discovery potential could be substantially boosted and a sensitivity comparable to that of all the other projects could be reestablished, which is essential for discriminating among competing new-physics scenarios should an observation occur in any of the channels. In this document, we express our interest in developing a $\mu^+ \to \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ experimental program at HIMB, with the goal of improving, within the next decade, the sensitivity of the $\mu^+ \to \mathrm{e}^+ \gamma$ search by more than one order of magnitude relative to the expected final result of the current leading experiment, MEG II. This effort would ensure that PSI retains its leadership in this field.</description>
