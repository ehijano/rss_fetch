      <title>Knapsack with Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and Hitting Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph $\GG=(\VV,\EE)$, with vertex weights $(w(u))_{u\in\VV}$, vertex values $(\alpha(u))_{u\in\VV}$, a knapsack size $s$, and a target value $d$, the \vcknapsack problem is to determine if there exists a subset $\UU\subseteq\VV$ of vertices such that \UU forms a vertex cover, $w(\UU)=\sum_{u\in\UU} w(u) \le s$, and $\alpha(\UU)=\sum_{u\in\UU} \alpha(u) \ge d$. In this paper, we closely study the \vcknapsack problem and its variations, such as \vcknapsackbudget, \minimalvcknapsack, and \minimumvcknapsack, for both general graphs and trees. We first prove that the \vcknapsack problem belongs to the complexity class \NPC and then study the complexity of the other variations. We generalize the problem to \setc and \hs versions and design polynomial time $H_g$-factor approximation algorithm for the \setckp problem and d-factor approximation algorithm for \hstp using primal dual method. We further show that \setcks and \hsmb are hard to approximate in polynomial time. Additionally, we develop a fixed parameter tractable algorithm running in time $8^{\OO(\tw)}\cdot n\cdot {\sf min}\{s,d\}$ where $\tw,s,d,n$ are respectively treewidth of the graph, the size of the knapsack, the target value of the knapsack, and the number of items for the \minimalvcknapsack problem.</description>

      <title>Linear Index for Logarithmic Search-Time for any String under any Internal Node in Suffix Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suffix trees are key and efficient data structure for solving string problems. A suffix tree is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of a given text of length $n$ with a linear construction cost. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to build a linear index that allows finding a pattern of any length under any internal node in a suffix tree in O(logn) time.</description>

      <title>fruit-SALAD: A Style Aligned Artwork Dataset to reveal similarity perception in image embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of visual similarity is essential for computer vision, and in applications and studies revolving around vector embeddings of images. However, the scarcity of benchmark datasets poses a significant hurdle in exploring how these models perceive similarity. Here we introduce Style Aligned Artwork Datasets (SALADs), and an example of fruit-SALAD with 10,000 images of fruit depictions. This combined semantic category and style benchmark comprises 100 instances each of 10 easy-to-recognize fruit categories, across 10 easy distinguishable styles. Leveraging a systematic pipeline of generative image synthesis, this visually diverse yet balanced benchmark demonstrates salient differences in semantic category and style similarity weights across various computational models, including machine learning models, feature extraction algorithms, and complexity measures, as well as conceptual models for reference. This meticulously designed dataset offers a controlled and balanced platform for the comparative analysis of similarity perception. The SALAD framework allows the comparison of how these models perform semantic category and style recognition task to go beyond the level of anecdotal knowledge, making it robustly quantifiable and qualitatively interpretable.</description>

      <title>One-Way Communication Complexity of Partial XOR Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boolean function $F(x,y)$ for $x,y \in \{0,1\}^n$ is an XOR function if $F(x,y)=f(x\oplus y)$ for some function $f$ on $n$ input bits, where $\oplus$ is a bit-wise XOR. XOR functions are relevant in communication complexity, partially for allowing Fourier analytic technique. For total XOR functions it is known that deterministic communication complexity of $F$ is closely related to parity decision tree complexity of $f$. Montanaro and Osbourne (2009) observed that one-sided communication complexity $D_{cc}^{\rightarrow}(F)$ of $F$ is exactly equal to nonadaptive parity decision tree complexity $NADT^{\oplus}(f)$ of $f$. Hatami et al. (2018) showed that unrestricted communication complexity of $F$ is polynomially related to parity decision tree complexity of $f$.
  We initiate the studies of a similar connection for partial functions. We show that in case of one-sided communication complexity whether these measures are equal, depends on the number of undefined inputs of $f$. On the one hand, if $D_{cc}^{\rightarrow}(F)=t$ and $f$ is undefined on at most $O(\frac{2^{n-t}}{\sqrt{n-t}})$, then $NADT^{\oplus}(f)=t$.
  On the other hand, for a wide range of values of $D_{cc}^{\rightarrow}(F)$ and $NADT^{\oplus}(f)$ (from constant to $n-2$) we provide partial functions for which $D_{cc}^{\rightarrow}(F) &lt; NADT^{\oplus}(f)$. In particular, we provide a function with an exponential gap between the two measures. Our separation results translate to the case of two-sided communication complexity as well, in particular showing that the result of Hatami et al. (2018) cannot be generalized to partial functions.
  Previous results for total functions heavily rely on Boolean Fourier analysis and the technique does not translate to partial functions. For the proofs of our results we build a linear algebraic framework instead. Separation results are proved through the reduction to covering codes.</description>

      <title>Set Descriptive Complexity of Solvable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent article, we introduced and studied a precise class of dynamical systems called solvable systems. These systems present a dynamic ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with solvable right-hand terms and unique evolution. They correspond to a class of systems for which a transfinite method exist to compute the solution. We also presented several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems might describe ordinal Turing computations. In the current article, we study in more depth solvable systems, using tools from descriptive set theory. By establishing a correspondence with the class of well-founded trees, we construct a coanalytic ranking over the set of solvable functions and discuss its relation with other existing rankings for differentiable functions, in particular with the Kechris-Woodin, Denjoy and Zalcwasser ranking. We prove that our ranking is unbounded below the first uncountable ordinal.</description>

      <title>Partial Degeneration of Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensors are often studied by introducing preorders such as restriction and degeneration: the former describes transformations of the tensors by local linear maps on its tensor factors; the latter describes transformations where the local linear maps may vary along a curve, and the resulting tensor is expressed as a limit along this curve. In this work we introduce and study partial degeneration, a special version of degeneration where one of the local linear maps is constant whereas the others vary along a curve. Motivated by algebraic complexity, quantum entanglement and tensor networks, we present constructions based on matrix multiplication tensors and find examples by making a connection to the theory of prehomogeneous tensor spaces. We highlight the subtleties of this new notion by showing obstruction and classification results for the unit tensor. To this end, we study the notion of aided rank, a natural generalization of tensor rank. The existence of partial degenerations gives strong upper bounds on the aided rank of a tensor, which allows one to turn degenerations into restrictions. In particular, we present several examples, based on the W-tensor and the Coppersmith-Winograd tensors, where lower bounds on aided rank provide obstructions to the existence of certain partial degenerations.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger as a Quantum Programmer: Estimating Entanglement via Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07911v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying entanglement is an important task by which the resourcefulness of a quantum state can be measured. Here, we develop a quantum algorithm that tests for and quantifies the separability of a general bipartite state by using the quantum steering effect, the latter initially discovered by Schr\"odinger. Our separability test consists of a distributed quantum computation involving two parties: a computationally limited client, who prepares a purification of the state of interest, and a computationally unbounded server, who tries to steer the reduced systems to a probabilistic ensemble of pure product states. To design a practical algorithm, we replace the role of the server with a combination of parameterized unitary circuits and classical optimization techniques to perform the necessary computation. The result is a variational quantum steering algorithm (VQSA), a modified separability test that is implementable on quantum computers that are available today. We then simulate our VQSA on noisy quantum simulators and find favorable convergence properties on the examples tested. We also develop semidefinite programs, executable on classical computers, that benchmark the results obtained from our VQSA. Thus, our findings provide a meaningful connection between steering, entanglement, quantum algorithms, and quantum computational complexity theory. They also demonstrate the value of a parameterized mid-circuit measurement in a VQSA.</description>

      <title>Bell sampling from quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in the verification of quantum computers is benchmarking their performance as a whole and demonstrating their computational capabilities. In this work, we find a universal model of quantum computation, Bell sampling, that can be used for both of those tasks and thus provides an ideal stepping stone towards fault-tolerance. In Bell sampling, we measure two copies of a state prepared by a quantum circuit in the transversal Bell basis. We show that the Bell samples are classically intractable to produce and at the same time constitute what we call a circuit shadow: from the Bell samples we can efficiently extract information about the quantum circuit preparing the state, as well as diagnose circuit errors. In addition to known properties that can be efficiently extracted from Bell samples, we give several new and efficient protocols: an estimator of state fidelity, a test for the depth of the circuit and an algorithm to estimate a lower bound to the number of T gates in the circuit. With some additional measurements, our algorithm learns a full description of states prepared by circuits with low T-count.</description>

      <title>Free Fermion Distributions Are Hard to Learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free fermions are some of the best studied quantum systems. However, little is known about the complexity of learning free-fermion distributions. In this work we establish the hardness of this task in the particle number non-preserving case. In particular, we give an information theoretical hardness result for the general task of learning from expectation values and, in the more general case when the algorithm is given access to samples, we give a computational hardness result based on the LPN assumption for learning the probability density function.</description>
