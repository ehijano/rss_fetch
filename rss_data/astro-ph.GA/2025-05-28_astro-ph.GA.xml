      <title>GalSBI-SPS: a stellar population synthesis-based galaxy population model for cosmology and galaxy evolution applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will enable unprecedented tests of the concordance cosmological model and of galaxy formation and evolution. Fully exploiting their potential requires a precise understanding of the selection effects on galaxies and biases on measurements of their properties, required, above all, for accurate estimates of redshift distributions n(z). Forward-modelling offers a powerful framework to simultaneously recover galaxy n(z)s and characterise the observed galaxy population. We present GalSBI-SPS, a new SPS-based galaxy population model that generates realistic galaxy catalogues, which we use to forward-model HSC data in the COSMOS field. GalSBI-SPS samples galaxy physical properties, computes magnitudes with ProSpect, and simulates HSC images in the COSMOS field with UFig. We measure photometric properties consistently in real data and simulations. We compare redshift distributions, photometric and physical properties to observations and to GalSBI. GalSBI-SPS reproduces the observed grizy magnitude, colour, and size distributions down to i&lt;23. Median differences in magnitudes and colours remain below 0.14 mag, with the model covering the full colour space spanned by HSC. Galaxy sizes are offset by 0.2 arcsec on average and some tension exists in the g-r colour, but the latter is comparable to that seen in GalSBI. Redshift distributions show a mild positive offset (0.01-0.08) in the mean. GalSBI-SPS qualitatively reproduces the stellar mass-SFR and size-stellar mass relations seen in COSMOS2020. GalSBI-SPS provides a realistic, survey-independent galaxy population description at a Stage-III depth using only parameters from the literature. Its predictive power will improve significantly when constrained against observed data using SBI, providing accurate redshift distributions satisfying the stringent requirements set by Stage IV surveys.</description>

      <title>Redshifts of Objects near 3C 220.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the course of studying the 3C 220.3 lensing system, spectra were obtained with the Binospec instrument on the MMT for 511 additional objects in 3C 220.3's vicinity. These gave 146 good-quality galaxy redshifts and identified 126 Galactic stars. The galaxy redshift histogram shows a peak near 3C 220.3's redshift, but there is no evidence for or against a galaxy group within 2 Mpc of 3C 220.3 itself. The spectra revealed 12 AGN candidates including a likely $z\approx4.64$ broad-line QSO. Visible and near-infrared imaging with HST allowed morphological classifications of 14 galaxies. One system is a potential analog of the Milky Way-LMC system with stellar mass ratio $\sim$0.6.</description>

      <title>DAWN JWST Archive: Morphology from profile fitting of over 340,000 galaxies in major fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To better understand how galaxies assemble their structure and evolve over cosmic time, we present a new catalog of morphological measurements for over 340,000 sources spanning $0 &lt; z &lt; 12$, derived from deep JWST NIRCam imaging across four major extragalactic fields (CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, PRIMER-COSMOS, GOODS) compiled in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We perform two-dimensional surface brightness fitting for all galaxies in a uniform, flux-limited sample. Each galaxy is modeled with both a S\'ersic profile and a two-component (bulge and disk) decomposition, yielding consistent structural parameters - including effective radius, S\'ersic index, axis ratio, and bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$). To demonstrate the scientific application of our morphology catalogs, we combined these measurements with DJA photometric redshifts, physical parameters and rest-frame colors, and investigated the relation between total, bulge and disk sizes, S\'ersic index ($n_S$), star formation activity, and redshift. Bulge-dominated galaxies (high $n_S$ and $B/T$) predominantly occupy the quiescent region of the $UVJ$ diagram, while disk-dominated galaxies are mostly star-forming. A significant bimodality persists, with quiescent disks and compact, bulge-dominated star-forming galaxies observed out to $z &gt; 3$. Quiescent galaxies also show significantly higher stellar mass surface densities, nearly an order of magnitude greater at $z \sim 4$ than at $z \sim 1$. Our results confirm a strong and evolving link between morphology and star formation activity, and support a scenario in which bulge growth and quenching are closely connected. This work is a highly valuable addition to the DJA, adding a morphological dimension to this rich dataset and thus enabling a wider scientific application.</description>

      <title>Stealing galaxies from galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate galaxy groups that reside in the field but have been previously processed by galaxy clusters. Observationally, they would appear to have the same properties as regular field groups at first glance. However, one would expect to find quantifiable differences in processed groups as dynamical interactions within clusters perturb them. We use IllustrisTNG300 simulation to statistically quantify that processed groups of galaxies show different properties compared to regular field groups. Our analysis encompasses a broad range of groups with total masses between $8 \times 10^{11} \Msun$ and $7 \times 10^{13} \Msun$. We distinguish between processed groups that passed through a galaxy cluster and capture more galaxies, referred to as thief groups, and groups that did not capture any new members, referred to as non-thief groups. The employed statistical tools show that thief groups are generally less compact and contain more members, while non-thief groups seem to have the same properties as the field groups which makes them indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Quasar absorption outflows on galactic scales: Insights from DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption outflows in quasars play an important role in understanding active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and their influence on galaxy evolution. The unprecedented spectral data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) opens new avenues to explore these outflows. We analyze five low-ionization absorption outflow systems in four intermediate-redshift quasars (2 &lt; z &lt; 3) using the data obtained by DESI in order to characterize their physical properties and energetics, and also to assess their role in AGN feedback. We use the spectra from DESI's Early Data Release to determine the ionic column densities, total hydrogen column densities, electron number densities, and ionization parameters via photoionization modeling and absorption line analysis. We derive the outflows' distance from the AGN, and its kinematic properties: mass-flow rates, kinetic luminosity, and momentum flux. Our study identifies five distinct mini-broad absorption line outflow systems, hosted by four quasars. The identified outflows exhibit hydrogen column densities of \log (N_H) = 20.0-20.7[cm^{-2}], ionization parameters of log (U_H) = -2.7 to -2.1, and electron number densities of log (n_e) =1.45-2.85[cm^{-2}]. The distances of the outflows from the central source are between 4.5 to 31 kpc, and the kinetic luminosities range from 2\times10^{-6} to 5\times10^{-3} of the Eddington luminosity. The outflows in J1407 and J1032 show the largest kinetic luminosities, with momentum flux ratios (\dot{p} / \dot{p}_{rad}) of about 2 and 0.2, respectively. Our findings highlight the vital role of DESI data in uncovering the diversity and significance of quasar outflows in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>First IFU observations of two GRB host galaxies at cosmic noon with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as powerful probes of distant galaxies. Their luminous afterglow pinpoints galaxies independent of luminosity, in contrast to most flux-limited surveys. Nevertheless, GRB-selected galaxy samples are not free from bias, instead tracing the conditions favoured by the progenitor stars. Characterising the galaxy populations traced by GRBs is therefore important both to effectively use GRBs as probes as well as to place stronger constraints on the progenitor stars capable of forming long GRBs. Spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations with integral field units (IFUs) provide valuable insights into the interstellar medium and stellar populations of GRB host galaxies. In this paper we present results of the first two GRB host galaxies observed with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU with a spatial resolution of ~ 1.6 kpc; the hosts of GRB 150403A and GRB 050820A at redshifts z ~ 2.06 and z ~ 2.61, respectively. The data reveal two complex galaxy environments made up of two or more star forming galaxies that are likely interacting given their small spatial separation (&lt; 20 kpc) and line of sight velocity offsets (&lt; 100 km/s). The measured gas-phase metallicity, star formation rates (SFRs), and key diagnostic line ratios for each of the detected galaxies are overall consistent with the properties of other star forming galaxies and GRB hosts at z &gt; 2. However, differences in the SFR and metallicities of the interacting galaxies highlight the importance of spatially resolved observations in order to accurately characterise the galaxy properties traced by GRBs.</description>

      <title>Diving into dangerous tides: The impact of galaxy cluster tidal environments on satellite galaxy mass densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite galaxies endure powerful environmental tidal forces that drive mass stripping of their outer regions. Consequently, satellites located in central regions of galaxy clusters or groups, where the tidal field is strongest, are expected to retain their central dense regions while losing their outskirts. This process produces a spatial segregation in the mean mass density with the cluster-centric distance (the $\bar{\rho}-r$ relation). To test this hypothesis, we combined semi-analytical satellite orbital models with cosmological galaxy simulations. We find that not only the mean total mass densities ($\bar{\rho}$), but also the mean stellar mass densities ($\bar{\rho}^{\star}$) of satellites exhibit this distance-dependent segregation ($\bar{\rho}^{\star}-r$). The correlation traces the host's tidal field out to a characteristic transition radius at $\Re_{\star}$ $\approx$ $0.5$ $R_{\rm vir}$, beyond which the satellite population's density profile can have a slight increase or remain flat, reflecting the weakened tidal influence in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and beyond. We compare these predictions with observational data from satellites in the Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters, as well as the Andromeda and Milky Way systems. Consistent trends in the satellite mean stellar mass densities are observed across these environments. Furthermore, the transition radius serves as a photometric diagnostic tool: it identifies regions where the stellar components of satellites underwent significant tidal processing and probes the gravitational field strength of the host halo.</description>

      <title>MWA and VLA Observations of Diffuse Radio Lobes in M 87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the projected, quasi-symmetric $\sim\rm46\,kpc$-scale diffuse radio lobes surrounding the giant elliptical galaxy M\,87, utilizing well-sampled wideband ($\rm 60\,MHz-10.55\,GHz$) observations from MWA and VLA, supplemented by data from LOFAR and Effelsberg. The observed structures feature sharp edges and filaments, with nearly uniform and moderately steep spectral indices ($\alpha$, mostly within $-1.2\leq\alpha\leq-0.8$), indicating turbulence. Well-sampled radio spectra for the lobes' diffuse region are derived using the continuous injection (CI) model (with $\alpha_{\rm inj}\simeq-0.86$ and $\nu_{\rm b}\simeq1.72\rm\,GHz$), and for its three localized regions using the impulsive injection model (e.g., JP model). From energy equipartition analysis, we estimate the typical magnetic field strength in the lobes' diffuse region to be $B_{\rm eq}\simeq10\,\mu\rm G$. The age of the lobes is estimated as $\sim30-50\,\rm~Myr$, based on lifetimes derived from the CI and JP models and sound crossing time. Outflow powers of $\sim(0.2-2)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the lobes' diffuse components and $\sim(1-11)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the whole source are calculated. With this power assessment, we conclude that the galactic stellar wind has a negligible effect, the active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven jet can provide the necessary energy for the whole system. Furthermore, we argue that while the wind driven by current AGN activity is unlikely to power the lobes' diffuse components, an average enhancement of AGN activity by a factor of $\sim 10^2$ over the past $\sim 30-50$ Myr remains plausible.</description>

      <title>Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): The sSFR-M$_{\star}$plane part I: The recent SFH of galaxies and movement through the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper we parameterised the evolution of the star-formation rate dispersion ($\sigma_{SFR}$) across the specific star-formation rate - stellar mass plane (sSFR-M$_{\star}$) using the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) - suggesting that the point at which the minimum in the dispersion occurs (M$^{*}_{\sigma-min}$) defines a boundary between different physical mechanisms affecting galaxy evolution. Here we expand upon that work to determine the movement of galaxies through the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane using their recent star-formation histories (SFHs) and explore how this leads to the observed $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$ relation. We find that galaxies in sub-regions of the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane show distinctly different SFHs, leading to a complex evolution of the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane and star-forming sequence (SFS). However, we find that selecting galaxies based on stellar mass and position relative to SFS alone (as is traditionally the case), may not identify sources with common recent SFHs, and therefore propose a new selection methodology. We then use the recent SFH of galaxies to measure the evolution of the SFS, showing that it has varying contributions from galaxies with different SFHs that lead to the observed changes in slope, normalisation and turnover stellar mass. Finally, we determine the overall evolution of the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane from $z\sim1$ to today. In the second paper in this series we will discuss physical properties of galaxies with common recent SFHs and how these lead to the observed $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$ relation and evolution of the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane.</description>

      <title>Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): The sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane part II: Starbursts, SFHs and AGN Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In part I of this series we discussed the variation of star-formation histories (SFHs) across the specific star formation rate - stellar mass plane (sSFR-M$_{\star}$) using the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). Here we explore the physical mechanisms that are likely driving these observational trends, by comparing the properties of galaxies with common recent SFH shapes. Overall, we find that the processes shaping the movement of galaxies through the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane can be be largely split into two stellar mass regimes, bounded by the minimum SFR dispersion ($\sigma_{SFR}$) point. At lower stellar masses we find that large $\sigma_{SFR}$ values are likely observed due to a combination of stochastic star-formation processes and a large variety in absolute sSFR values, but relatively constant/flat SFHs. While at higher stellar masses we see strong observational evidence that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are associated with rapidly declining SFHs, and that these galaxies reside in the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ region of the plane. As such, we suggest that AGN feedback, leading to galaxy quenching, is the primary driver of the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ values. These results are consistent with previous theoretical interpretations of the $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$ relation.</description>

      <title>Understanding gas mixing in the circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gas mixing in a simulated Milky Way-mass galaxy's circumgalactic medium (CGM) using cosmological zoom-in simulations. We insert tracer dyes in the CGM with different gas flows (shearing, coherent, and static) and diverse physical properties to track gas mixing and find that shearing flows generally exhibit a higher dye spread. We then correlate the extent and shape of dye spread with local gas properties for a generalised understanding of gas mixing. The velocity dispersion and magnitude of traceless symmetric shear (shear deformation) tensors in small regions (&lt;5 kpc) around the dye injection locations most accurately predict the extent of dye spread after 200 Myr (Spearman rank 0.87). We use this to determine diffusivity calibration constants for subgrid-scale mixing models. While the dye shape after 200 Myr aligns well with velocity and magnetic field dispersion, the best alignment occurs with the dispersion of eigenvectors representing stretching (from traceless symmetric shear tensor) and plane-of-rotation (from antisymmetric shear or vorticity tensor) in large regions (&gt;10 kpc) around the dye injection locations. Therefore, shear-related statistics and velocity dispersion are the properties best able to predict both the extent and shape of mixed gas in our simulations. Our dyes spread roughly linearly with time, suggesting superdiffusive behaviour in the CGM, potentially due to turbulent and large-scale coherent flows. We calculate physical Reynolds numbers of 10^2-10^3 using gas properties in the CGM of our simulations, which a resolution of a few hundred pc could resolve, but our 1 kpc resolution leads to significant numerical mixing. However, our correlation results are robust to changes in resolution. These results can be used to predict diffusion coefficients from local gas properties to model processes like magnetic field diffusion, heat transport, and metal mixing.</description>

      <title>Tracing Galaxy Evolution in infalling galaxies of Abell 496: From Starburst to Quenching</title>

Abstract: During the fall of late-type galaxies into clusters, they can experiment a variety of evolutionary mechanisms according their local environment. Consequently, studying the UV emission and the cold gas of late-type galaxies provide key insights in the evolution of short-lived starburst and galaxy quenching. In this work, we conduted a study of two 28' fields observed with UVIT-AstroSat in the central region of the Abell cluster A496 ($z=0.033$), including HI, data from NRAO VLA. We reported 22 cluster members detected in FUV; all of them are detected in HI, or have upper limits for the HI-mass. We find our FUV detected galaxies generally have higher specific star formation rates than other star forming galaxies. Most of the FUV galaxies with masses above 10$^9 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$,and showing high sSFR have no close neighbors, pointing at RPS as the dominant mechanism affecting them. In contrast, most of the low-mass FUV objects present at least one companion, suggesting that tidal interactions also play an important role in the triggering of infalling galaxies. Combining the FUV-SFR with the HI properties of the observed galaxies in A496 we identify an evolutionary sequence consisting of five stages: (1) Pre-triggering, (2) Initial SF-triggering, (3) Peak of star-formation, (4) SF-fading, and (5) SF-quenching. During this path, normal gas-rich objects reach a gas-deficiency phase with SFR well below the main sequence. This process, prior to becoming a full passive galaxy, can be accomplished within a few 10$^{8}$ yr.</description>

      <title>The sulfur plume in the Horsehead nebula: New detections of S$_2$H, SH$^+$, and CO$^+$</title>

Abstract: Sulfur is essential for life, but its abundance and distribution in the interstellar medium remain uncertain, with over 90% of sulfur undetected in cold molecular clouds. Sulfur allotropes (S$_{\rm n}$) have been proposed as possible reservoirs, but the only detected interstellar molecule with a disulfide bond is S$_2$H in the Horsehead Nebula, making the estimation of sulfur chains abundances difficult. Here we present total-power ALMA images of H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$, and SH$^+$ towards the Horsehead nebula. These observations, with unprecedented sensitivity (rms $\sim$ 1.5 mK), provide the first detections of SH$^+$ and CO$^+$ in this region, together with the identification of a new S$_2$H line. The comparison of the spectroscopic images of H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$ and SH$^+$ shows that the S$_2$H emission originates from a warm gas layer adjacent to the photodissociation front. The emission peak of S$_2$H is offset from those of reactive ions such as SH$^+$, CO$^+$, and SO$^+$, suggesting that gas-phase reactions involving SH$^+$ and H$_2$S are not the dominant formation pathway of S$_2$H. Instead, we propose that S$_2$H is desorbed from irradiated grain surfaces by non-thermal processes. The SH$^+$ detection indicates that sulfur is not significantly depleted at the UV-irradiated edge of the molecular cloud, arguing against a major refractory sulfur reservoir in the interior of molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Spectral indices in active galactic nuclei as seen by Apertif and LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new radio continuum images obtained with Apertif at 1.4 GHz. The images, produced with a direction-dependent calibration pipeline, cover 136 square degrees of the Lockman Hole and 24 square degrees of the ELAIS-N fields, with an average resolution of 17x12" and residual noise of 33 uJy/beam. With the improved depth of the images we found in total 63692 radio sources, many of which are detected for the first time at this frequency. With the addition of the previously published Apertif catalog for the Bootes field, we cross-match with the LOFAR deep-fields value-added catalogs at 150 MHz, resulting in a homogeneous sample of 10196 common sources with spectral index estimates, one of the largest to date. We analyze and discuss the correlations between spectral index, redshift, linear sources size, and radio luminosity, taking into account biases of flux-density-limited surveys. Our results suggest that the observed correlation between spectral index and redshift of active galactic nuclei can be attributed to the Malmquist bias reflecting an intrinsic relation between radio luminosity and the spectral index. We also find a correlation between spectral index and linear source size with more compact sources having steeper spectra.</description>

      <title>Diverse reddening distributions in sight lines to type Ia supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from host-galaxy interstellar reddening.The latter is commonly modelled in a probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies. We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies, primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the distribution may peak at E(B-V)&gt;0 when considering a population of young type Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust expected in these galaxies.</description>

      <title>Sub-arcsecond-resolution LOFAR observations of bright sub-millimetre galaxies in the North Ecliptic Pole field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright SMGs contribute significantly to the star formation rate (SFR) density (20-50\%) and stellar mass density ($\sim$ 30-50\%) at $z=$ 2-4 with SFRs$\ge 1000$ M$_\odot$,yr$^{-1}$ and stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$-$10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. The number of bright SMGs with such high SFRs is hard to reconcile with the standard models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper we provide evidence that, in a small sample of 12 bright SMGs, the SFRs derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting are significantly higher than those obtained using low-frequency radio emission as a proxy for star formation. Using the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT), which allows imaging at 144 MHz with sub-arcsecond angular resolution, we have produced deep images of a small sample of bright SMGs in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field extracted from the NEPSC2 survey. For all 12 SMGs, we find radio-emitting mid-infrared galaxies at distances from a few arcseconds down to sub-arcsecond scales from the SMG and/or the presence of a radio-emitting AGN. The SFRs derived from the radio emission of the SMG, disentangled from the AGN-related radio emission, are systematically lower by a factor of $\sim 5$ (median value) than those derived from the multi-band SED fitting. We discuss whether our assumptions might be, at least in part, responsible for the observed discrepancy. We argue that the radio-derived SFRs are not systematically underestimated but can be affected by a significant dispersion ($0.3-0.5$ dex). Considering these new SFR estimates, the offset of the specific SFR of the 12 bright SMGs from the star-forming galaxy main sequence ($\Delta\mathrm{(SSFR)}$) is significantly reduced, with all 12 bright SMGs which are only a factor of 2 more star-forming than the main sequence galaxies.</description>

      <title>Solar C/O ratio in planet-forming gas at 1 au in a highly irradiated disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical composition of exoplanets is thought to be influenced by the composition of the disks in which they form. JWST observations have unveiled a variety of species in numerous nearby disks, showing significant variations in the C/O abundance ratio. However, little is known about the composition and C/O ratio of disks around young stars in clusters exposed to strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation from nearby massive stars, which are representative of the environments where most planetary systems form, including ours. We present JWST spectroscopy of d203-504, a young 0.7 $\rm M_{\odot}$ star in the Orion Nebula with a 30 au disk irradiated by nearby massive stars. These observations reveal spectroscopic signatures of CO, H$_2$O, CH$_3^+$, and PAHs. Water and CO are detected in absorption in the inner disk ($r\lesssim 1$ au), where the estimated gas-phase C/O ratio is 0.48, consistent with the Solar value and that of the Orion Nebula. In contrast, \ch{CH3+} and PAHs are found in the extended surface layers of the disk. These results suggest that gas in the inner disk is chemically shielded from UV radiation while the surface layers of the disk experience UV-induced chemistry, potentially depleting their carbon content.</description>

      <title>A black hole in a near-pristine galaxy 700 million years after the Big Bang</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04, hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow Hbeta emission indicates an extremely low chemical enrichment, less than 0.01 solar. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in rare cases. Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole.</description>

      <title>Dust Budget Crisis in Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for significant dust extinction of $A_V \gtrsim 3$ mag. However, the dust-reddened AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI, Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly constrained to $A_V \lesssim 1.0$ mag for A2744-45924 and $A_V \lesssim 1.5$ mag for RUBIES-BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised $A_V$ values yield a radiative efficiencies of $10\%$ for the LRD population, easing the tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories, provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred Project: Modeling Baryon and Hot-Gas Fraction Evolution in Simulated Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The baryon fraction of galaxy clusters is a powerful tool to inform on the cosmological parameters while the hot-gas fraction provides indications on the physics of the intracluster plasma and its interplay with the processes driving galaxy formation. Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from The Three Hundred collaboration of about 300 simulated massive galaxy clusters with median mass $M_{500}\approx7 \times 10^{14}$M$_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, we model the relations between total mass and either baryon fraction or the hot gas fractions at overdensities $\Delta = 2500$, $500$, and $200$ with respect to the cosmic critical density, and their evolution from $z\sim 0$ to $z\sim 1.3$. We fit the simulation results for such scaling relations against three analytic forms (linear, quadratic, and logarithmic in a logarithmic plane) and three forms for the redshift dependence, considering as a variable both the inverse of cosmic scale factor, $(1+z)$, and the Hubble expansion rate, $E(z)$. We show that power-law dependencies on cluster mass poorly describe the investigated relations. A power-law fails to simultaneously capture the flattening of the total baryon and gas fractions at high masses, their drop at the low masses, and the transition between these two regimes. The other two functional forms provide a more accurate description of the curvature in mass scaling. The fractions measured within smaller radii exhibit a stronger evolution than those measured within larger radii. From the analysis of these simulations, we conclude that as long as we include systems in the mass range herein investigated, the baryon or gas fraction can be accurately related to the total mass through either a parabola or a logarithm in the logarithmic plane. The trends are common to all modern hydro simulations, although the amplitude of the drop at low masses might differ [Abridged].</description>

      <title>Modified Newtonian Dynamics: Observational Successes and Failures</title>

Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative to the dark matter hypothesis that attempts to explain the "missing gravity" problem in astrophysics and cosmology through a modification to objects' dynamics. Since its conception in 1983, MOND has had a chequered history. Some phenomena difficult to understand in standard cosmology MOND explains remarkably well, most notably galaxies' radial dynamics encapsulated in the Radial Acceleration Relation. But for others it falls flat -- mass discrepancies in clusters are not fully accounted for, the Solar System imposes a constraint on the shape of the MOND modification seemingly incompatible with that from galaxies, and non-radial motions are poorly predicted. An experiment that promised to be decisive -- the wide binary test -- has produced mainly confusion. This article summarises the good, the bad and the ugly of MOND's observational existence. I argue that despite its imperfections it does possess ongoing relevance: there may yet be crucial insight to be gleaned from it.</description>

      <title>Deuterated water abundance in the young hot core RCW 120 S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the emission of water molecules cannot be observed from Earth, less abundant isotopologues, such as H$_2^{18}$O and HDO, are used to trace water in star-forming regions. The main aim of this study is to determine HDO abundance in the hot core RCW 120 S2. We performed observations of the hot core in the 200-255~GHz range using the nFLASH230 receiver on the APEX telescope. Two HDO lines were detected toward RCW 120 S2. Their intensities are described by excitation temperature $286\pm2$~K and gas number density $\geq 10^9$~cm$^{-3}$. The emission originates from the hot core rather than the warm dense envelope surrounding a central young stellar object. The HDO column density ranges from $(3.9-7.9)\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ with a most probable value $5.6\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. The HDO abundance relative to hydrogen nuclei is $1.5\times10^{-9}$. This HDO abundance value is among the lowest reported for hot cores. Combined with the non-detection of the H$_2^{18}$O line, we conclude that protostellar heating in RCW 120 S2 is still in its early stages.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Accretion disc/Corona Connection in NGC 6814: Insights from UV and X-ray spectral-timing studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of NGC 6814 using AstroSat's 2019 and XMM-Newton's 2021 observations. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between FUV (1541 \AA)/X-ray and UVW1 (2910 \AA)/X-ray variations, with delays of $\sim 15~\rm{ks}$ and $30~\rm{ks}$, respectively. We constructed four broadband SEDs after applying aperture correction (for the UVIT filter), subtracting host galaxy and emission line contributions from UV flux, and using mean X-ray spectra alongside selected UV data points. First, we fitted the SEDs with KYNSED model assuming various combinations of inclination, $\theta$, color correction factors, $f_{\rm col}$, and BH spins. Best-fit models were achieved for $\theta=70^{\circ}$ (consistent with past estimates for this source) and for spin $\leq 0.5$, while $f_{\rm col}$ is not constrained. KYNSED provided satisfactory fit to all SEDs in the case when the corona is powered by the accretion process, with $\sim 10-20$% of the accretion power transferred to the corona, $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.1$, corona radius of $\sim 6-10~r_g$, and height of $\sim7.5-35~r_g$. Model time-lags computed using the SED best-fit results are aligned well with the observed time-lags. Although some of the model parameters are not constrained, the important result of our work is that both the broadband X-ray/UV spectra and the X-ray/UV time-lags in NGC 6814 are consistent with the hypothesis of X-ray illumination of the disc in a lamp-post geometry framework. Within this model framework, we do not need to assume an outer or inner truncated disc.</description>

      <title>The Kick Velocity Distribution of Isolated Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22102</link>

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze the proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or dispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than $10$ Myr follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of $\ln\left(v/\text{km}/\text{s}^{-1}\right)=5.60\pm0.12$ and a standard deviation of $0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}150$--$200$ km s$^{-1}$, which we adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories, we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars with ages below $40$ Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to systematic errors) fit with mean and standard deviation of $5.67\pm0.10$ and $0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes, and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.</description>

      <title>Ito calculus meets the Hubble tension: Effects of small-scale electron density fluctuations on the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel formalism to include the effect of electron density fluctuations at ultra small scales (well below the sound horizon at last scattering) on the observed anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We treat the electron field as an independent stochastic variable and obtain the required ensemble-averaged photon Boltzmann equations using Ito calculus. Beyond changes to the average recombination history (which can be incorporated in the standard approach) our work identifies two new effects caused by the clumpiness of the medium. The first is a correction to the Thomson visibility function caused by correlations of the electron fluctuations along the line of sight, leading to an additional broadening of the visibility towards higher redshifts which causes extra damping and smearing of the CMB anisotropies. The second effect is a reduction of the effective scattering rate in the (pre-)recombination era that affects the photon transfer functions in a non-trivial manner. These new effects are subdominant in LCDM but can be significant in cosmologies with an early onset of structure formation (e.g., due to generation of enhanced small-scale power) as suggested by a number of indicators (e.g., the abundance of high redshift galaxies observed by JWST). We discuss the relevance of these new effects to the Hubble tension, finding that corrections which cannot be captured by simple modifications to the average recombination history arise. This highlights how important an understanding of the recombination process is in cosmological inference, and that a coordinated simulation and analysis campaign is required as part of the search for the origin of the various tensions in cosmology.</description>

      <title>The stellar evolution perspective on the metallicity dependence of classical Cepheid Leavitt laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of metallicity on the Cepheid Leavitt law (LL) and, in turn, the Hubble constant, has been the subject of much recent debate. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of metallicity effects on Cepheid LLs based on synthetic Cepheid populations computed using Geneva models and the SYCLIST tool. We computed 296 co-eval populations in the age range of 5-300 Myr for metallicities representative of the Sun, the LMC, and the SMC ($Z \in [0.014, 0.006, 0.002]$). We computed LLs in fourteen optical-to-infrared passbands and five reddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes. All Cepheid populations take into account distributions of rotation rates and companion stars. We show excellent agreement between the predicted populations and key observational constraints from the literature. Our simulations predict a significant LL slope-metallicity dependence ($\beta_{\rm M} &gt; 0$) that renders LLs steeper at lower metallicity at all wavelengths. Importantly, $\beta_{\rm M} \ne 0$ implies that the intercept-metallicity dependence, $\alpha_{\rm M}$, depends on pivot period; an issue not previously considered. Comparison with $\alpha_{\rm M}$ measurements in individual passbands reported in the literature yields acceptable agreement on the order of agreement found among different observational studies. The wavelength dependence and magnitude of the disagreement suggests a possible origin in reddening-related systematics. Conversely, we report excellent agreement between our $\alpha_{\rm M} = -0.20 \pm 0.03$ mag dex$^{-1}$ and the value determined by the SH0ES distance ladder in the reddening-free H-band Wesenheit magnitude ($-0.217 \pm 0.046$), the currently tightest and conceptually simplest empirical constraint.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. V. Modeling Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies with Updated UniverseMachine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environment plays a critical role in shaping the assembly of low-mass galaxies. Here, we use the UniverseMachine (UM) galaxy-halo connection framework and the Data Release 3 of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey to place dwarf galaxy star formation and quenching into a cosmological context. UM is a data-driven forward model that flexibly parameterizes galaxy star formation rates (SFR) using only halo mass and assembly history. We add a new quenching model to UM, tailored for galaxies with stellar masses $\lesssim 10^9$ solar masses, and constrain the model down to a stellar mass $\gtrsim 10^7$ solar masses using new SAGA observations of 101 satellite systems around Milky Way (MW)-mass hosts and a sample of isolated field galaxies in a similar mass range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The new best-fit model, 'UM-SAGA,' reproduces the satellite stellar mass functions, average SFRs, and quenched fractions in SAGA satellites while keeping isolated dwarfs mostly star forming. The enhanced quenching in satellites relative to isolated field galaxies leads the model to maximally rely on halo assembly to explain the observed environmental quenching. Extrapolating the model down to a stellar mass $\sim 10^{6.5}$ solar masses yields a quenched fraction of $\gtrsim$ 30% for isolated field galaxies and $\gtrsim$ 80% for satellites of MW-mass hosts at this stellar mass. This specific prediction can soon be tested by spectroscopic surveys to reveal the relative importance of internal feedback, cessation of mass and gas accretion, satellite-specific gas processes, and reionization for the evolution of faint low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The SKA Galactic Centre Survey -- A White Paper</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With its extreme density of stars and stellar remnants, dense young massive clusters, high specific star formation rate, intense radiation field, high magnetic field strength, and properties of the interstellar medium that resemble those in high redshift galaxies and starbursts, the Galactic Centre is the most extreme environment that we can observe in detail. It is also the only nucleus of a galaxy that we can observe with a resolution of just a few milli parsecs. This makes it a crucial target to understand the physics of galactic nuclei and star formation, as well as the connection between them. It enables studies of a large number of otherwise rare objects, such as extremely massive stars and stellar remnants, at a well-defined distance, thus facilitating the interpretation of their properties. The Galactic Centre has been and is being studied intensively with the most advanced facilities. In this White Paper, we advocate for a large-area, multi-wavelength survey with the Square Kilometre Array of an area of about 1.25x0.3 deg**2 (180x40 pc**2), centered on the massive black hole Sagittarius A* and for repeated deep observations of the nuclear star cluster over a decade, which will allow the community to address multiple science problems with a single data set.</description>

      <title>EDEN: Exploring Disks Embedded in N-body simulations of Milky-Way-mass halos from Symphony</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of galactic disks on the tidal stripping of cold dark matter subhalos within Milky Way (MW)-mass halos ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 10^{12}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) using a new simulation suite, EDEN. By re-simulating 45 MW-mass zoom-in halos from the N-body Symphony compilation with embedded disk potentials, which evolve according to star formation histories predicted by the UniverseMachine model, we self-consistently tie disk growth to halo accretion rate and significantly expand the range of disk masses and formation histories studied. We use the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to enhance the robustness of subhalo tracking. We find that disks near the median disk-to-halo mass ratio of our sample ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} = 2\%$) reduce subhalo peak mass functions within 100 kpc by about $10\%$ for peak masses above $ 10^8\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Heavier, MW/M31-like disks ($M_{\ast, \rm Disk}/M_{\rm vir, host} \gtrsim 5\%$) lead to a reduction of more than $40\%$. Subhalo abundance suppression is more pronounced near halo centers, with particularly enhanced stripping for subhalos accreted over 8 Gyr ago on orbits with pericenters &lt; 100 kpc. Suppression is further amplified when disk mass is increased within fixed halo and disk assembly histories. In all cases, the suppression we measure should be interpreted as stripping below the mass resolution limit rather than complete subhalo disruption. This study reshapes our understanding of the MW's impact on its satellites, suggesting it strips subhalos more efficiently than typical MW-mass galaxies due to its larger disk-to-halo mass ratio and earlier disk formation.</description>

      <title>Project Dinos II: Redshift evolution of dark and luminous matter density profiles in strong-lensing elliptical galaxies across $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new measurement of the dark and luminous matter distribution of massive elliptical galaxies, and their evolution with redshift, by combining strong lensing and dynamical observables. Our sample of 56 lens galaxies covers a redshift range of $0.090 \leq z_{\rm l} \leq 0.884$. By combining new Hubble Space Telescope imaging with previously observed velocity dispersion and line-of-sight measurements, we decompose the luminous matter profile from the dark matter profile and perform a Bayesian hierarchical analysis to constrain the population-level properties of both profiles. We find that the inner slope of the dark matter density profile ("cusp"; $\rho_{\rm DM} \propto r^{-\gamma_{\rm in}}$) is consistent ($\mu_{\gamma_{\rm in}}=0.97^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ with $\leq0.07$ intrinsic scatter) with a standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW; $\gamma_{\rm in}=1$) at $z=0.35$. Additionally, we find an appreciable evolution with redshift ($d\log(\gamma_{\rm in})/dz=-0.44^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$) resulting in a shallower slope (of $&gt; 2 \sigma$ tension from NFW) at redshifts $z \ge 0.49$. This is in excellent agreement with previous population-level observational studies, as well as with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations such as IllustrisTNG. We also find the stellar mass-to-light ratio at the population level is consistent with that of a Salpeter initial mass function, a small stellar mass-to-light gradient ($\kappa_{*}(r)\propto r^{-\eta}$, with $\overline{\eta} \leq 5 \times 10^{-5}$), and isotropic stellar orbits. Our averaged total mass density profile is consistent with a power-law profile within 0.25 to 4 Einstein radii ($\overline{\gamma} = 2.24 \pm 0.14$), with an internal mass-sheet transformation parameter $\overline{\lambda} = 0.96 \pm 0.03$ consistent with no mass sheet. Our findings confirm the validity of the standard mass models used for time-delay cosmography.</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmic web on galaxy properties and their correlations: Insights from Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze a volume-limited sample from the SDSS and explore how cosmic web environments affect the interrelations between various galaxy properties, such as $(u-r)$ colour, stellar mass, specific star formation rate, metallicity, morphology, and $D4000$. Our analysis reveals that the first three principal components (PC1, PC2 and PC3) account for approximately $85\%$ of the data variance. We classify galaxies into different cosmic web environments based on the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor and compare PC1, PC2, PC3 across these environments. PC1 is dominated by colour, sSFR, D4000, and morphology. It displays clear bimodality across all cosmic web environments, with sheets and clusters showing distinct preferences for negative and positive PC1 values, respectively. This variation reflects the strong role of environmental processes in regulating star formation. PC2 and PC3, respectively show positively and negatively skewed unimodal distributions in all environments. PC2 is primarily influenced by metallicity whereas PC3 is dominated by stellar mass. It indicates that metallicity evolves gradually and is less sensitive to environmental extremes. PC3 likely captures residual variation in stellar mass. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test confirms that the distributions of PC1, PC2 and PC3 differ significantly across environments, with a confidence level exceeding $99.99\%$. Furthermore, we calculate the normalized mutual information (NMI) between the principal components and individual galaxy properties within different cosmic web environments. A two-tailed t-test reveals that for each relationship and each pair of environments, the null hypothesis is rejected with a confidence level $&gt;99.99\%$. Our analysis confirms that cosmic web environments play a significant role in shaping the correlations between galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>The Tale of Two Telescopes: How Hubble Uniquely Complements the James Webb Space Telescope: Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple but compelling argument, focusing on galaxy science, for preserving the main imagers and operational modes of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for as long as is technically feasible. While star-formation started at redshifts z$\gtrsim$10$-$13, when the universe was less than 300$-$500 Myr old, the CSFH did not peak until z$\simeq$1.9, and has steadily declined since that time. Hence, at least half of all stars in the universe formed in the era where HST provides its unique rest-frame UV view of unobscured young, massive stars tracing cosmic star-formation. By rendering a subset of the 556.3 hours of available HST images in 12 filters of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) in an appropriate mix of colors, we illustrate the unique capabilities of HST for galaxy science emphasizing that rest-frame UV$-$optical wavelength range. We then contrast this with the 52.7 publicly available hours of JWST/NIRCam images in 8 filters of the same HUDF area from the JADES project, rendering these at the redder near-IR wavelengths to illustrate the unique capabilities of JWST to detect older stellar populations at higher redshifts, as well as very dusty stellar populations and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). HST uniquely probes (unobscured) young, hot, massive stars in galaxies, while JWST reveals more advanced stages of older stellar populations, as well as relatively short-lived phases where galaxies produce and shed a lot of dust from intense star-formation, and the very high redshift universe (z$\gtrsim$10$-$11) not accessible by HST. We conclude that HST and JWST are highly complementary facilities that took decades to build to ensure decades of operation. To maximize return on investment on both HST and JWST, ways will need to be found to operate HST imaging instruments in all relevant modes for as long as possible into the JWST mission.</description>

      <title>CO(1--0) imaging reveals 10-kiloparsec molecular gas reservoirs around star-forming galaxies at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive, intensely star-forming galaxies at high redshift require a supply of molecular gas from their gas reservoirs, replenished by infall from the surrounding circumgalactic medium, to sustain their immense star-formation rates. However, our knowledge of the extent and morphology of their cold-gas reservoirs is still in its infancy.
  We present the results of stacking 80 hours of JVLA observations of CO(1--0) emission -- which traces the cold molecular gas -- in nineteen $z=2.0-4.5$ dusty, star-forming galaxies from the AS2VLA survey. The visibility-plane stack reveals extended emission with a half-light radius of $3.8\pm0.5$~kpc, 2--3$\times$ more extended than the dust-obscured star formation and $1.4\pm0.2\times$ more extended than the stellar emission revealed by JWST. Stacking the [CI](1--0) observations for ten galaxies from our parent sample yields a half-light radius $\leq$2.6~kpc, marginally smaller than CO(1--0). The CO(1--0) size is also comparable to the [CII] halos detected around high-redshift star-forming galaxies, suggesting these arise from molecular gas. Photo-dissociation region modelling indicates that the extended CO(1--0) emission arises from clumpy, dense clouds rather than smooth, diffuse gas.
  Our results show that the bulk (up to 80\%) of molecular gas resides outside the star-forming region; with only a small part directly contributing to their current star formation.</description>

      <title>Quenching of Galaxies at Cosmic Noon: Understanding the Effect of Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to identify quiescent galaxies in the 2-deg$^2$ COSMOS field at $z \sim 3.1$ and analyze their environment. Using data from the ODIN survey and COSMOS2020 catalog, we identify 24 massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) with stellar masses $\geq 10^{10.6}$ and derive their star formation histories and quenching timescales using SED fitting with BAGPIPES. Voronoi-based density maps trace local and large-scale environments using Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters and photometric galaxies. Results indicate uniformly short quenching timescales ($&lt;$500 Myr) independent of environmental density, suggesting rapid internal mechanisms such as AGN feedback dominate over environmental factors. MQGs do not correlate with protoclusters or filaments, although some are near gas-rich filaments but show no rejuvenation. These findings suggest quenching at high redshift is driven primarily by internal processes rather than environmental interactions.</description>

      <title>Central kiloparsec region of Andromeda. I. Dynamical modelling</title>

Abstract: The Andromeda galaxy (M31) is the most nearby giant spiral galaxy, an opportunity to study with high resolution dynamical phenomena occurring in nuclear disks and bulges, able to explain star formation quenching, and galaxy evolution through collisions and tides. Multi-wavelength data have revealed in the central kpc of M31 strong dynamical perturbations, with an off-centered tilted disk and ring, coinciding with a dearth of atomic and molecular gas. Our goal to understand the origin of these perturbations is to propose a dynamical model, reproducing the global features of the observations. We are reporting about integral field spectroscopy of the ionized gas with H$\alpha$ and [NII] obtained with SITELLE, the optical imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (IFTS) at the Canada France Hawaii telescope (CFHT). Using the fully sampled velocity field of ionized gas, together with the more patchy molecular gas velocity field, previously obtained with the CO lines at IRAM-30m telescope, and the dust photometry, we identify three dynamical components in the gas, the main disk, a tilted ring and a nuclear warped disk. A mass model of the central kpc is computed, essentially from the stellar nuclear disk and bulge, with small contributions of the main stellar and gaseous disk, and dark matter halo. The kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas is then computed in this potential, and the velocity field confronted to observations. The best fit helps to determine the physical parameters of the three identified gas components, size, morphology and geometrical orientation. The results are compatible with a recent head-on collision with a M-32 like galaxy, as previously proposed. The kinematical observations correspond to a dynamical re-orientation of the perturbed nuclear disk, through warps and tearing disk into ring, following the collision.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved spectro-photometric SED Modeling of NGC 253's Central Molecular Zone I. Studying the star formation in extragalactic giant molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15082</link>

Abstract: Studying the interstellar medium in nearby starbursts is essential for understanding the physical mechanisms driving these objects, thought to resemble young star-forming galaxies. This study aims to analyze the physical properties of the first spatially-resolved multi-wavelength SED of an extragalactic source, spanning six decades in frequency (from near-UV to cm wavelengths) at an angular resolution of 3$^{\prime\prime}$ (51 pc at the distance of NGC,253). We focus on the central molecular zone (CMZ) of NGC,253, which contains giant molecular clouds (GMCs) responsible for half of the galaxy's star formation. We use archival data, spanning optical to centimeter wavelengths, to compute SEDs with the GalaPy and CIGALE codes for validation, and analyze stellar optical spectra with the \textsc{starlight} code.
  Our results show significant differences between central and external GMCs in terms of stellar and dust masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and bolometric luminosities. We identify the best SFR tracers as radio continuum bands at 33 GHz, radio recombination lines, and the total infrared luminosity (L$_{\rm IR}$; 8-1000$\mu$m), as well as 60$\mu$m IR emission. BPT and WHAN diagrams indicate shock signatures in NGC~253's nuclear region, associating it with AGN/star-forming hybrids, though the AGN fraction is negligible ($\leq$7.5%). Our findings show significant heterogeneity in the CMZ, with central GMCs exhibiting higher densities, SFRs, and dust masses compared to external GMCs. We confirm that certain centimeter photometric bands can reliably estimate global SFR at GMC scales.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphology Classification via Deep Semi-Supervised Learning with Limited Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy morphology classification plays a crucial role in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. With galaxy observation data growing exponentially, machine learning has become a core technology for this classification task. However, traditional machine learning methods predominantly rely on supervised learning frameworks, and their dependence on large of labeled samples limits practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative hybrid semi-supervised model, GC-SWGAN, designed to tackle galaxy morphology classification under conditions of limited labeled data. This model integrates semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (SGAN) with Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), establishing a multi-task learning framework. Within this framework, the discriminator and classifier are designed independently while sharing part of the architecture. By collaborating with the generator, the model significantly enhances both classification performance and sample generation capabilities, while also improving convergence and stability during training. Experimental results demonstrate that, on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset, GC-SWGAN achieves comparable or even superior classification accuracy (exceeding 75%) using only one-fifth of the labeled samples typically required by conventional fully supervised methods. Under identical labeled conditions, the model displays excellent generalization performance, attaining approximately 84% classification accuracy. Notably, in extreme scenarios where only 10\% of the data is labeled, GC-SWGAN still achieves high classification accuracy (over 68%), fully demonstrating its stability and effectiveness in low-labeled data environments. Furthermore, galaxy images generated by GC-SWGAN are visually similar to real samples.</description>

      <title>A Novel Density Profile for Isothermal Cores of Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel analytic density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the isothermal-core configuration, i.e. where both the density and velocity dispersion profiles exhibit central plateaus in the halo innermost region. Importantly, the profile retains a simple and tractable functional form. We demonstrate analytically how our density profile satisfies the aforementioned conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We further validate the profile using idealized N-body simulations, showing that it provides excellent representations of both the density and velocity dispersion profiles across a broad range of evolutionary stages, from the early thermalization phase to the late core-collapse regime. As a result of its accuracy and simplicity, the proposed profile offers a robust framework for analyzing halo evolution in a variety of SIDM scenarios. It also holds practical utility in reducing simulation needs and in generating initial conditions for simulations targeting the deep core-collapse regime.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Synthetic-source Injection Across the Full Survey Using Balrog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic source injection (SSI), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey (DES), SSI plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of $146$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint, generated using the Balrog SSI pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the DES Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between SSI and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of DES Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the DES Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest SSI catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of SSI catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>The implications of stochastic gas torques for asymmetric binaries in the LISA band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from asymmetric mass-ratio black-hole binaries carry unique information about their astrophysical environment. For instance, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could potentially measure the amplitude and slope of gas torques in binaries embedded in the accretion disks of Active Galactic Nuclei, helping differentiate competing accretion disk models. However, this relies on simplified analytic models, which do not account for the stochastic variability of torques seen in hydrodynamic simulations. In this work, we use hydrodynamic simulations to create gravitational waveforms for extreme and intermediate mass-ratio inspirals in the LISA band. We then analyze these simulated waveforms using simpler templates that assume analytic torques, without stochastic time variability. By performing realistic Bayesian parameter estimation, we find no bias at 90% confidence in the binary parameters; however, estimates of accretion disk parameters, such as torque amplitude and slope, may be biased. Typically, the posterior distribution is centered around the average value of the torques, but when stochastic variability is large, the posterior can indicate no torques, even though they are present in the simulation. Our results suggest that while simplified analytic torque models work well for estimating binary parameters, caution is needed when using them to infer properties of the accretion disk. This work moves towards a more realistic assessment of one of the LISA science objectives, i.e., probing the properties of the astrophysical environments of black holes.</description>

      <title>StarFlow: Leveraging Normalizing Flows for Stellar Age Estimation in SDSS-V DR19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the ages of stars is crucial for unraveling the formation history and evolution of our Galaxy. Traditional methods for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic data often struggle with providing appropriate uncertainty estimations and are severely constrained by the parameter space. In this work, we introduce a new approach using normalizing flows, a type of deep generative model, to estimate stellar ages for evolved stars with improved accuracy and robust uncertainty characterization. The model is trained on stellar masses for evolved stars derived from asteroseismology and predicts the relationship between the carbon and nitrogen abundances of a given star and its age. Unlike standard neural network techniques, normalizing flows enable the recovery of full likelihood distributions for individual stellar ages, offering a richer and more informative perspective on uncertainties. Our method yields age estimations for 378,720 evolved stars and achieves a typical absolute age uncertainty of approximately 2 Gyr. By intrinsically accounting for the coverage and density of the training data, our model ensures that the resulting uncertainties reflect both the inherent noise in the data and the completeness of the sampled parameter space. Applying this method to data from the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, we have produced the largest stellar age catalog for evolved stars to date.</description>
