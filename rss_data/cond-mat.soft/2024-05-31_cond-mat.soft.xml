      <title>Long-Range Correlations in Elastic Moduli and Local Stresses at the Unjamming Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the behavior of spatially heterogeneous elastic moduli as well as the correlations between local moduli in model solids with short-range repulsive potentials. We show through numerical simulations that local elastic moduli exhibit long-range correlations, similar to correlations in the local stresses. Specifically, the correlations in local shear moduli exhibit anisotropic behavior at large lengthscales characterized by pinch-point singularities in Fourier space, displaying a structural pattern akin to shear stress correlations. Focussing on two-dimensional jammed solids approaching the unjamming transition, we show that stress correlations exhibit universal properties, characterized by a quadratic $p^2$ dependence of the correlations as the pressure $p$ approaches zero, independent of the details of the model. In contrast, the modulus correlations exhibit a power-law dependence with different exponents depending on the specific interaction potential. Furthermore, we illustrate that while affine responses lack long-range correlations, the total modulus, which encompasses non-affine behavior, exhibits long-range correlations.</description>

      <title>The escape transition of a lattice star polymer grafted in a pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers in confined spaces are compressed and have reduced conformational entropy, and will partially or fully escape from confinement if conditions are suitable. This is in particular the case for a polymer grafted in a pore. The escape of the polymer from the pore may be considered a partial translocation from the pore into bulk solution, and the resulting conformational readjustment of the polymer has characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition. In this paper a lattice self-avoiding walk model of a star polymer grafted in a pore is examined numerically using the PERM algorithm. We show that the arms of the grafted lattice star escape one at a time as the length of the pore is reduced, consistent with earlier results in the literature. Critical points for the escape transitions are estimated for square and cubic lattice models and we also examine various properties of the model as it undergoes the escape transitions.</description>

      <title>Calculating pair-correlations from random particle configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle pair-correlations are broadly used to describe particle distributions in chemistry, physics, and material science. Many theoretical methods require the pair-correlation to predict material properties such as fluid flow, thermal properties, or wave propagation. In all these applications it is either important to calculate a pair-correlation from specific particle configurations, or vice-versa: determine the likely particle configurations from a pair-correlation which is needed to fabricate a particulate material. Most available methods to calculate the pair-correlation from a particle configuration require that the configuration be very large to avoid effects from the boundary. Here we show how to avoid boundary effects even for small particle configurations. Having small particle configurations leads to far more efficient numerical methods. We also demonstrate how to use techniques from smooth nonlinear optimisation to quickly recover a particle configuration from a pair-correlation.</description>

      <title>Influence of cholesterol on hydrogen-bond dynamics of water molecules in lipid-bilayer systems at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cholesterol (Chol) plays a crucial role in shaping the intricate physicochemical attributes of biomembranes, exerting considerable influence on water molecules proximal to the membrane interface. In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on the bilayers of two lipid species, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM); they are distinct with respect to the structures of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) acceptors. Our investigation focuses on the dynamic properties and H-bonds of water molecules in the lipid-membrane systems, with particular emphasis on the influence of Chol at varying temperatures. Notably, in the gel phase at 303 K, the presence of Chol extends the lifetimes of H-bonds of the oxygen atoms acting as H-bond acceptors within DPPC with water molecules by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5. In the liquid-crystalline phase at 323 K, on the other hand, H-bonding dynamics with lipid membranes remain largely unaffected by Chol. This observed shift in H-bonding states serves as a crucial key to unraveling the subtle control mechanisms governing water dynamics in lipid-membrane systems.</description>

      <title>Solvent Selectivity controls Micro- versus Macro-phase Separation in Multiblock Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble were used to obtain critical parameters and conditions leading to microphase separation for block copolymers with solvophilic and solvophobic segments. Solvent selectivity was systematically varied to distinguish between systems that undergo macrophase separation to ones that microphase separate in the dilute phase, prior to macrophase separating. Finite-size scaling was used to obtain the critical parameters. Interestingly, corrections to scaling increase significantly for systems that form finite aggregates. The threshold value of solvent selectivity for aggregation was determined for symmetric diblock chains of varying length. The results indicate that long diblock copolymers form micelles in the dilute phase prior to macrophase separation, even in marginally selective solvents. The dependence of critical temperature on solvent selectivity was obtained for triblock, multiblock, and alternating chains. For highly selective solvents, strong structuring of both dilute and dense phases makes it harder to reach equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation-Driven Hysteretic Adhesion and Repulsion between Opposing Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>

      <title>Unraveling friction forces of droplets on a non-wetting surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the friction forces encountered by droplets on non-wetting surfaces, specifically focusing on superhydrophobic and superheated substrates. Employing a combination of experimental techniques, including inclined plane tests and cantilever force sensor measurements, we quantify friction forces across a broad range of velocities and surface types. Our results demonstrate that friction forces vary significantly with changes in droplet velocity and surface characteristics, transitioning from contact line pinning to viscous dissipation in the bulk of the droplet. We propose a universal scaling law that accounts for contact angle hysteresis, viscous dissipation, and aerodynamic drag, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding droplet dynamics on non-wetting surfaces. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing surface designs in fluid transport and microfluidic applications, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and innovation in these technologies.</description>
