      <title>Reconstructing Large Scale Production Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an algorithm to reconstruct large weighted firm-to-firm networks using information about the size of the firms and sectoral input-output flows. Our algorithm is based on a four-step procedure. We first generate a matrix of probabilities of connections between all firms in the economy using an augmented gravity model embedded in a logistic function that takes firm size as mass. The model is parameterized to allow for the probability of a link between two firms to depend not only on their sizes but also on flows across the sectors to which they belong. We then use a Bernoulli draw to construct a directed but unweighted random graph from the probability distribution generated by the logistic-gravity function. We make the graph aperiodic by adding self-loops and irreducible by adding links between Strongly Connected Components while limiting distortions to sectoral flows. We convert the unweighted network to a weighted network by solving a convex quadratic programming problem that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the weights. The solution preserves the observed firm sizes and sectoral flows within reasonable bounds, while limiting the strength of the self-loops. Computationally, the algorithm is O(N2) in the worst case, but it can be evaluated in O(N) via sector-wise binning of firm sizes, albeit with an approximation error. We implement the algorithm to reconstruct the full US production network with more than 5 million firms and 100 million buyer-seller connections. The reconstructed network exhibits topological properties consistent with small samples of the real US buyer-seller networks, including fat-tails in degree distribution, mild clustering, and near-zero reciprocity. We provide open-source code of the algorithm to enable researchers to reconstruct large-scale granular production networks from publicly available data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Comprehensible Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developments in machine learning and big data allow firms to fully personalize and target their marketing mix. However, data and privacy regulations, such as those in the European Union (GDPR), incorporate a "right to explanation," which is fulfilled when targeting policies are comprehensible to customers. This paper provides a framework for firms to navigate right-to-explanation legislation. First, I construct a class of comprehensible targeting policies that is represented by a sentence. Second, I show how to optimize over this class of policies to find the profit-maximizing comprehensible policy. I further demonstrate that it is optimal to estimate the comprehensible policy directly from the data, rather than projecting down the black box policy into a comprehensible policy. Third, I find the optimal black box targeting policy and compare it to the optimal comprehensible policy. I then empirically apply my framework using data from a price promotion field experiment from a durable goods retailer. I quantify the cost of explanation, which I define as the difference in expected profits between the optimal black box and comprehensible targeting policies. Compared to the black box benchmark, the comprehensible targeting policy reduces profits by 7.5% or 23 cents per customer.</description>

      <title>How IFRS Affects Value Relevance and Key Financial Indicators? Evidence from the UK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has two contributions to the International Financial Reporting Stands (IFRS) adoption literature. First is the scrutinizing impact of IFRS adoption on value relevance in the UK with TEST-A analysis under the H01 hypothesis. The second contribution is capturing the impact of IFRS adoption on key financial indicators of firms with the TEST-B analysis that hypothesizes H02.The statistical differences of items of two different reporting standards are examined with non-parametric tests as all input variables failed the Shapiro-Wilk and Lilliefors normality tests in TEST-A. The finding rejects the H01 hypothesis for BvMv, and agrees that IFRS has impact on value relevance. Besides, Ohlson's (1995) model documents that the coefficient of dummy variable (MODE) is positive. Therefore, the analysis concludes that IFRS has positive impact on value relevance. The aftermath of TEST-B rejects the H02 hypothesis for all profitability ratios (ROE, ROCE, ROA, PM) and gearing ratios (GR). It concludes that profitability and gearing ratios are affected by IFRS adoption, whereas efficiency-liquidity ratios are not. Also, in Forward Stepwise regression analysis only ROCE, ROA, and PM ratios show significant results. The analysis documents positive and significant impact of IFRS on these three ratios.</description>

      <title>Impact of Brand Dynamics on Insurance Premiums in Turkey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines influences of brand dynamics on insurance premium productions in Turkey using a dynamic GMM panel estimation technique sampling 31 insurance firms over 2005-2015. The results reveals that brands trust appears as a chief driving force behind premium production where its unit increase augments premium outputs by 5.32 million Turkish Liras (TL). Moreover, the brand value of firms also appears a statistically significant determinant of premium sales, but its size impact remains limited comparing to brand trust, i.e. a million TL increase in brand value generates only 0.02 million TL increase in sales. On the other hand, the study also documents a strong momentum driven from past years premium production with trade-off magnitude of 1 to 0.85. This might imply a higher loyalty-stickiness of customers in Turkey, as well as a self-feeding "bandwagon effect".</description>

      <title>Does Firm-Level AI Adoption Improve Early-Warning of Corporate Financial Distress? Evidence from Chinese Non-Financial Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates whether firm-level artificial intelligence (AI) adoption improves the out-of-sample prediction of corporate financial distress models beyond traditional financial ratios. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms (2008-2023), we address sparse AI data with a novel pruned training window method, testing multiple machine learning models. We find that AI adoption consistently increases predictive accuracy, with the largest gains in recall rates for identifying distressed firms. Tree-based models and AI density metrics proved most effective. Crucially, models using longer histories outperformed those relying solely on recent "AI-rich" data. The analysis also identifies divergent adoption patterns, with healthy firms exhibiting earlier and higher AI uptake than distressed peers. These findings, while based on Chinese data, provide a framework for early-warning signals and demonstrate the broader potential of AI metrics as a stable, complementary risk indicator distinct from traditional accounting measures.</description>

      <title>Retail Price Ripples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much like small ripples in a stream, which get lost in the larger waves, small changes in retail prices often fly under the radar of public perceptions, while large price changes appear as marketing moves associated with demand and competition. Unnoticed, these could increase consumers out of pocket expenses. Indeed, retailers could boost their profits by making numerous small price increases or by obfuscating large price increases with numerous small price decreases, thereby bypassing the consumers full attention and consideration, and triggering consumer fairness concerns. Yet only a handful of papers study small price changes. Extant results are often based on a single retailer, limited products, short time span, and legacy datasets dating back to the 1980s and 1990s, leaving their current practical relevance questionable. Researchers have also questioned whether the reported observations of small price changes are artifacts of measurement errors driven by data aggregation. In a series of analyses of a large dataset containing almost 79 billion weekly price observations from 2006 to 2015, covering 527 products, and about 35,000 stores across 161 retailers, we find robust evidence of asymmetric pricing in the small, where small price increases outnumber small price decreases, but no such asymmetry is present in the large. We also document the reverse phenomenon, where small price decreases outnumber small price increases. Our results are robust to several possible measurement issues. Importantly, our findings indicate a greater current relevance and generalizability of such asymmetric pricing practices than the existing literature recognizes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impacts of Economic Growth on Ecosystem and Its Subcomponents in Turkiye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02676v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impacts of economic growth on ecosystem in Turkiye. The study uses annual data for the period 1995-2021 and the ARDL method. The study utilizes the Ecosystem Vitality Index, a sub-dimension of the Environmental Performance Index. In addition, seven models were constructed to assess in detail the impact of economic growth on different dimensions of the ecosystem. The results show that economic growth has a significant impact in all models analyzed. However, the direction of this impact differs across ecosystem components. Economic growth is found to have a positive impact on agriculture and water resources. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP increases the agriculture and water resources indices by 0.074-0.672%. In contrast, economic growth has a negative impact on biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality. In these models, a 1% increase in GDP reduces the indices of biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, acid rain and total ecosystem vitality by 0.101-2.144%. The results suggest that the environmental costs of economic growth processes need to be considered. Environmentally friendly policies should be combined with sustainable development strategies to reduce the negative impacts of economic growth.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Rating Socioeconomic Disparities among Provinces: A Case of Turkiye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regional disparities in the economic and social structures of countries have a great impact on their development levels. In geographically, culturally and economically diverse countries like Turkiye, determining the socioeconomic status of the provinces and regional differences is an important step for planning and implementing effective policies. Therefore, this study aims to determine the socioeconomic disparities of the provinces in Turkiye. For this purpose, a socioeconomic development index covering the economic and social dimensions of 81 provinces was constructed. For the index, 16 different indicators representing economic and social factors were used. These indicators were converted into indices using the Min-Max normalization method and Principal Component Analysis. Afterwards, using these indices, the provinces were divided into groups using the K-Means clustering algorithm and the Elbow method. In the last part of the study, the results are presented in a visual format using Scatter Plots, clustering maps and QGIS mapping tools. The results of the study show that 2 of the 81 provinces in Turkiye have very high, 30 high, 25 medium and 24 low socioeconomic indices. Istanbul and Ankara have very high socioeconomic status. In general, the provinces in western Turkiye have a high socioeconomic index, while the provinces in eastern and southeastern Anatolia face serious challenges in terms of socioeconomic indicators.</description>

      <title>HODL Strategy or Fantasy? 480 Million Crypto Market Simulations and the Macro-Sentiment Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crypto enthusiasts claim that buying and holding crypto assets yields high returns, often citing Bitcoin's past performance to promote other tokens and fuel fear of missing out. However, understanding the real risk-return trade-off and what factors affect future crypto returns is crucial as crypto becomes increasingly accessible to retail investors through major brokerages. We examine the HODL strategy through two independent analyses. First, we implement 480 million Monte Carlo simulations across 378 non-stablecoin crypto assets, net of trading fees and the opportunity cost of 1-month Treasury bills, and find strong evidence of survivorship bias and extreme downside concentration. At the 2-3 year horizon, the median excess return is -28.4 percent, the 1 percent conditional value at risk indicates that tail scenarios wipe out principal after all costs, and only the top quartile achieves very large gains, with a mean excess return of 1,326.7 percent. These results challenge the HODL narrative: across a broad set of assets, simple buy-and-hold loads extreme downside risk onto most investors, and the miracles mostly belong to the luckiest quarter. Second, using a Bayesian multi-horizon local projection framework, we find that endogenous predictors based on realized risk-return metrics have economically negligible and unstable effects, while macro-finance factors, especially the 24-week exponential moving average of the Fear and Greed Index, display persistent long-horizon impacts and high cross-basket stability. Where significant, a one-standard-deviation sentiment shock reduces forward top-quartile mean excess returns by 15-22 percentage points and median returns by 6-10 percentage points over 1-3 year horizons, suggesting that macro-sentiment conditions, rather than realized return histories, are the dominant indicators for future outcomes.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Enterprise Decision-Making Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence improves enterprise decision-making by accelerating data analysis, reducing human error, and supporting evidence-based choices. A quantitative survey of 92 companies across multiple industries examines how AI adoption influences managerial performance, decision efficiency, and organizational barriers. Results show that 93 percent of firms use AI, primarily in customer service, data forecasting, and decision support. AI systems increase the speed and clarity of managerial decisions, yet implementation faces challenges. The most frequent barriers include employee resistance, high costs, and regulatory ambiguity. Respondents indicate that organizational factors are more significant than technological limitations. Critical competencies for successful AI use include understanding algorithmic mechanisms and change management. Technical skills such as programming play a smaller role. Employees report difficulties in adapting to AI tools, especially when formulating prompts or accepting system outputs. The study highlights the importance of integrating AI with human judgment and communication practices. When supported by adaptive leadership and transparent processes, AI adoption enhances organizational agility and strengthens decision-making performance. These findings contribute to ongoing research on how digital technologies reshape management and the evolution of hybrid human-machine decision environments.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Doughnut of social and planetary boundaries with frugal machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.</description>

      <title>Could AI Leapfrog the Web? Evidence from Teachers in Sierra Leone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Only 37% of sub-Saharan Africans use the internet, and those who do seldom rely on traditional web search. A major reason is that bandwidth is scarce and costly. We study whether an AI-powered WhatsApp chatbot can bridge this gap by analyzing 40,350 queries submitted by 529 Sierra Leonean teachers over 17 months. Each month, more teachers relied on AI than web search for teaching assistance. We compare the AI responses to the top results from google.com.sl, which mostly returns web pages formatted for foreign users: just 2% of pages originate in-country. Also, each web page consumes 3,107 times more bandwidth than an AI response on average. As a result, querying AI through WhatsApp is 98% less expensive than loading a web page, even including AI compute costs. In blinded evaluations, an independent sample of teachers rate AI responses as more relevant, helpful, and correct answers to queries than web search results. These findings suggest that AI can provide cost-effective access to information in low-connectivity environments.</description>
