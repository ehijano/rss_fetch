      <title>ProteinBench: A Holistic Evaluation of Protein Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein foundation models, significantly improving performance in protein prediction and generative tasks ranging from 3D structure prediction and protein design to conformational dynamics. However, the capabilities and limitations associated with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and application while fostering collaboration within the field.</description>

      <title>Joint trajectory and network inference via reference fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network inference, the task of reconstructing interactions in a complex system from experimental observables, is a central yet extremely challenging problem in systems biology. While much progress has been made in the last two decades, network inference remains an open problem. For systems observed at steady state, limited insights are available since temporal information is unavailable and thus causal information is lost. Two common avenues for gaining causal insights into system behaviour are to leverage temporal dynamics in the form of trajectories, and to apply interventions such as knock-out perturbations. We propose an approach for leveraging both dynamical and perturbational single cell data to jointly learn cellular trajectories and power network inference. Our approach is motivated by min-entropy estimation for stochastic dynamics and can infer directed and signed networks from time-stamped single cell snapshots.</description>

      <title>Modelling the effect of antibody depletion on dose-response behavior for common immunostaining protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dose-response curves of immunostaining experiments are commonly described as Langmuir isotherm. However, for common immunostaining protocols the equilibrium assumption is violated and the dose-response behavior is governed by antibody accumulation. If bound antibodies are replenished, i.e. the concentration of unbound antibodies is constant, the accumulation model can easily be solved analytically. Yet, in many experimental setups the overall amount of antibodies is fixed such that antibody binding reduces the concentration of free antibodies. Solving the accumulation model for this case is more difficult and seems to be impossible if the epitopes are heterogeneous. In this paper, we solve the accumulation model with antibody depletion analytically for the simple case of identical epitopes. We derive inequalities between the depletion-free accumulation model, the accumulation model and the Langmuir isotherm. This allows us to characterize the antibody depletion effect. We generalize the problem to heterogeneous epitopes, where we prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution that behaves as expected by the experimental setting. With these properties we derive bounds for the resulting multi-epitope-class accumulation model and investigate the depletion effect in the case of heterogeneous epitopes.</description>

      <title>The microbiome science of composting and human excrement composting: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear waste management systems are unsustainable and contribute to environmental degradation, economic inequity, and health disparities. Among the array of environmental challenges stemming from anthropogenic impacts, the management of human excrement (human feces and urine) stands as a significant concern. Over two billion people do not have access to adequate sanitation resulting in a global public health crisis.
  Composting is the microbial biotechnology aimed at cycling organic waste, including human excrement, for improved public health, agricultural productivity and safety, and environmental sustainability. Applications of modern microbiome-omics and related technologies have vast capacity to support continued advances in composting science and praxis. In this article, we review literature focused on applications of microbiome technologies to study composting systems and reactions. The studies we survey generally fall into the categories of animal manure composting, food and landscaping waste composting, biosolids composting, and human excrement composting. We review experiments utilizing microbiome technologies to investigate strategies for enhancing pathogen suppression and accelerating the biodegradation of organic matter. Additionally, we explore studies focused on the bioengineering potential of microbes as inoculants to facilitate degradation of toxins such as pharmaceuticals or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The findings from these studies underscore the importance of advancing our understanding of composting processes through the integration of emerging microbiome-omics technologies.
  We conclude that work to-date has demonstrated exciting basic and applied science potential from studying compost microbiomes, with promising implications for enhancing global environmental sustainability and public health.</description>

      <title>Universal scale-free representations in human visual cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How does the human visual cortex encode sensory information? To address this question, we explore the covariance structure of neural representations. We perform a cross-decomposition analysis of fMRI responses to natural images in multiple individuals from the Natural Scenes Dataset and find that neural representations systematically exhibit a power-law covariance spectrum over four orders of magnitude in ranks. This scale-free structure is found in multiple regions along the visual hierarchy, pointing to the existence of a generic encoding strategy in visual cortex. We also show that, up to a rotation, a large ensemble of principal axes of these population codes are shared across subjects, showing the existence of a universal high-dimensional representation. This suggests a high level of convergence in how the human brain learns to represent natural scenes despite individual differences in neuroanatomy and experience. We further demonstrate that a spectral approach is critical for characterizing population codes in their full extent, and in doing so, we reveal a vast space of uncharted dimensions that have been out of reach for conventional variance-weighted methods. A global view of neural representations thus requires embracing their high-dimensional nature and understanding them statistically rather than through visual or semantic interpretation of individual dimensions.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of nonlinear ODE Models with Time-Varying Parameters: the General Analytical Solution and Applications in Viral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13507v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifiability is a structural property of any ODE model characterized by a set of unknown parameters. It describes the possibility of determining the values of these parameters from fusing the observations of the system inputs and outputs. This paper finds the general analytical solution of this fundamental problem and, based on this, provides a general and automated analytical method to determine the identifiability of the unknown parameters. In particular, the method can handle any model, regardless of its complexity and type of non-linearity, and provides the identifiability of the parameters even when they are time-varying. In addition, it is automatic as it simply needs to follow the steps of a systematic procedure that only requires to perform the calculation of derivatives and matrix ranks. Time-varying parameters are treated as unknown inputs and their identification is based on the very recent analytical solution of the unknown input observability problem [1, 2]. The method is used to determine the identifiability of the unknown time-varying parameters that characterize two non-linear models in the field of viral dynamics (HIV and Covid-19) and a non-linear model that characterizes the genetic toggle switch. New fundamental properties that characterize these models are determined and discussed in detail through a comparison with the state-of-the-art results. In particular, regarding the very popular HIV ODE model and the genetic toggle switch model, the method automatically finds new important results that are in contrast with the results in the current literature.</description>
