      <title>Analyzing Customer-Facing Vendor Experiences with Time Series Forecasting and Monte Carlo Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: eBay partners with external vendors, which allows customers to freely select a vendor to complete their eBay experiences. However, vendor outages can hinder customer experiences. Consequently, eBay can disable a problematic vendor to prevent customer loss. Disabling the vendor too late risks losing customers willing to switch to other vendors, while disabling it too early risks losing those unwilling to switch. In this paper, we propose a data-driven solution to answer whether eBay should disable a problematic vendor and when to disable it. Our solution involves forecasting customer behavior. First, we use a multiplicative seasonality model to represent behavior if all vendors are fully functioning. Next, we use a Monte Carlo simulation to represent behavior if the problematic vendor remains enabled. Finally, we use a linear model to represent behavior if the vendor is disabled. By comparing these forecasts, we determine the optimal time for eBay to disable the problematic vendor.</description>

      <title>Transient anisotropic kernel for probabilistic learning on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PLoM (Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds) is a method introduced in 2016 for handling small training datasets by projecting an It\^o equation from a stochastic dissipative Hamiltonian dynamical system, acting as the MCMC generator, for which the KDE-estimated probability measure with the training dataset is the invariant measure. PLoM performs a projection on a reduced-order vector basis related to the training dataset, using the diffusion maps (DMAPS) basis constructed with a time-independent isotropic kernel. In this paper, we propose a new ISDE projection vector basis built from a transient anisotropic kernel, providing an alternative to the DMAPS basis to improve statistical surrogates for stochastic manifolds with heterogeneous data. The construction ensures that for times near the initial time, the DMAPS basis coincides with the transient basis. For larger times, the differences between the two bases are characterized by the angle of their spanned vector subspaces. The optimal instant yielding the optimal transient basis is determined using an estimation of mutual information from Information Theory, which is normalized by the entropy estimation to account for the effects of the number of realizations used in the estimations. Consequently, this new vector basis better represents statistical dependencies in the learned probability measure for any dimension. Three applications with varying levels of statistical complexity and data heterogeneity validate the proposed theory, showing that the transient anisotropic kernel improves the learned probability measure.</description>

      <title>Extended Fiducial Inference: Toward an Automated Process of Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While fiducial inference was widely considered a big blunder by R.A. Fisher, the goal he initially set --`inferring the uncertainty of model parameters on the basis of observations' -- has been continually pursued by many statisticians. To this end, we develop a new statistical inference method called extended Fiducial inference (EFI). The new method achieves the goal of fiducial inference by leveraging advanced statistical computing techniques while remaining scalable for big data. EFI involves jointly imputing random errors realized in observations using stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo and estimating the inverse function using a sparse deep neural network (DNN). The consistency of the sparse DNN estimator ensures that the uncertainty embedded in observations is properly propagated to model parameters through the estimated inverse function, thereby validating downstream statistical inference. Compared to frequentist and Bayesian methods, EFI offers significant advantages in parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. Specifically, EFI provides higher fidelity in parameter estimation, especially when outliers are present in the observations; and eliminates the need for theoretical reference distributions in hypothesis testing, thereby automating the statistical inference process. EFI also provides an innovative framework for semi-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in High-frequency Market Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a new and comprehensive theoretical analysis for the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in high-frequency market making. We bridge the modern RL theory and the continuous-time statistical models in high-frequency financial economics. Different with most existing literature on methodological research about developing various RL methods for market making problem, our work is a pilot to provide the theoretical analysis. We target the effects of sampling frequency, and find an interesting tradeoff between error and complexity of RL algorithm when tweaking the values of the time increment $\Delta$ $-$ as $\Delta$ becomes smaller, the error will be smaller but the complexity will be larger. We also study the two-player case under the general-sum game framework and establish the convergence of Nash equilibrium to the continuous-time game equilibrium as $\Delta\rightarrow0$. The Nash Q-learning algorithm, which is an online multi-agent RL method, is applied to solve the equilibrium. Our theories are not only useful for practitioners to choose the sampling frequency, but also very general and applicable to other high-frequency financial decision making problems, e.g., optimal executions, as long as the time-discretization of a continuous-time markov decision process is adopted. Monte Carlo simulation evidence support all of our theories.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the Adam optimizer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods are nowadays the method of choice for the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) in artificial intelligence systems. In practically relevant training problems, usually not the plain vanilla standard SGD method is the employed optimization scheme but instead suitably accelerated and adaptive SGD optimization methods are applied. As of today, maybe the most popular variant of such accelerated and adaptive SGD optimization methods is the famous Adam optimizer proposed by Kingma &amp; Ba in 2014. Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in implementations, it remained an open problem of research to provide a convergence analysis for the Adam optimizer even in the situation of simple quadratic stochastic optimization problems where the objective function (the function one intends to minimize) is strongly convex. In this work we solve this problem by establishing optimal convergence rates for the Adam optimizer for a large class of stochastic optimization problems, in particular, covering simple quadratic stochastic optimization problems. The key ingredient of our convergence analysis is a new vector field function which we propose to refer to as the Adam vector field. This Adam vector field accurately describes the macroscopic behaviour of the Adam optimization process but differs from the negative gradient of the objective function (the function we intend to minimize) of the considered stochastic optimization problem. In particular, our convergence analysis reveals that the Adam optimizer does typically not converge to critical points of the objective function (zeros of the gradient of the objective function) of the considered optimization problem but converges with rates to zeros of this Adam vector field.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Large Language Model Inference with Self-Supervised Early Exits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for accelerating inference in large, pre-trained language models (LLMs) by introducing early exits during inference. The computational demands of these models, used across a wide range of applications, can be substantial. By capitalizing on the inherent variability in token complexity, our approach enables selective acceleration of the inference process. Specifically, we propose the integration of early exit ''heads'' atop existing transformer layers, which facilitate conditional terminations based on a confidence metric. These heads are trained in a self-supervised manner using the model's own predictions as training data, thereby eliminating the need for additional annotated data. The confidence metric, established using a calibration set, ensures a desired level of accuracy while enabling early termination when confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold. Notably, our method preserves the original accuracy and reduces computational time on certain tasks, leveraging the existing knowledge of pre-trained LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. This lightweight, modular modification has the potential to greatly enhance the practical usability of LLMs, particularly in applications like real-time language processing in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>DKL-KAN: Scalable Deep Kernel Learning using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for scalable and expressive models in machine learning is paramount, particularly in applications requiring both structural depth and flexibility. Traditional deep learning methods, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLP), offer depth but lack ability to integrate structural characteristics of deep learning architectures with non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods. To address this, deep kernel learning (DKL) was introduced, where inputs to a base kernel are transformed using a deep learning architecture. These kernels can replace standard kernels, allowing both expressive power and scalability. The advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has generated considerable attention and discussion among researchers in scientific domain. In this paper, we introduce a scalable deep kernel using KAN (DKL-KAN) as an effective alternative to DKL using MLP (DKL-MLP). Our approach involves simultaneously optimizing these kernel attributes using marginal likelihood within a Gaussian process framework. We analyze two variants of DKL-KAN for a fair comparison with DKL-MLP: one with same number of neurons and layers as DKL-MLP, and another with approximately same number of trainable parameters. To handle large datasets, we use kernel interpolation for scalable structured Gaussian processes (KISS-GP) for low-dimensional inputs and KISS-GP with product kernels for high-dimensional inputs. The efficacy of DKL-KAN is evaluated in terms of computational training time and test prediction accuracy across a wide range of applications. Additionally, the effectiveness of DKL-KAN is also examined in modeling discontinuities and accurately estimating prediction uncertainty. The results indicate that DKL-KAN outperforms DKL-MLP on datasets with a low number of observations. Conversely, DKL-MLP exhibits better scalability and higher test prediction accuracy on datasets with large number of observations.</description>

      <title>Tractable and Provably Efficient Distributional Reinforcement Learning with General Value Function Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributional reinforcement learning improves performance by effectively capturing environmental stochasticity, but a comprehensive theoretical understanding of its effectiveness remains elusive. In this paper, we present a regret analysis for distributional reinforcement learning with general value function approximation in a finite episodic Markov decision process setting. We first introduce a key notion of Bellman unbiasedness for a tractable and exactly learnable update via statistical functional dynamic programming. Our theoretical results show that approximating the infinite-dimensional return distribution with a finite number of moment functionals is the only method to learn the statistical information unbiasedly, including nonlinear statistical functionals. Second, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, $\texttt{SF-LSVI}$, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $d_E$ is the eluder dimension of a function class.</description>

      <title>State-observation augmented diffusion model for nonlinear assimilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation has become a crucial technique aiming to combine physical models with observational data to estimate state variables. Traditional assimilation algorithms often face challenges of high nonlinearity brought by both the physical and observational models. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven assimilation algorithm based on generative models to address such concerns. Our State-Observation Augmented Diffusion (SOAD) model is designed to handle nonlinear physical and observational models more effectively. The marginal posterior associated with SOAD has been derived and then proved to match the real posterior under mild assumptions, which shows theoretical superiority over previous score-based assimilation works. Experimental results also indicate that our SOAD model may offer improved accuracy over existing data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Two Completely Parameter-Free Alternating Gradient Projection Algorithms for Nonconvex-(strongly) Concave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their importance in various emerging applications, efficient algorithms for solving minimax problems have recently received increasing attention. However, many existing algorithms require prior knowledge of the problem parameters in order to achieve optimal iteration complexity. In this paper, we propose a completely parameter-free alternating gradient projection (PF-AGP) algorithm to solve the smooth nonconvex-(strongly) concave minimax problems using a backtracking strategy, which does not require prior knowledge of parameters such as the Lipschtiz constant $L$ or the strongly concave constant $\mu$. The PF-AGP algorithm utilizes a parameter-free gradient projection step to alternately update the outer and inner variables in each iteration. We show that the total number of gradient calls of the PF-AGP algorithm to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point for nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left( L\kappa^3\varepsilon^{-2} \right)$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number, while the total number of gradient calls to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point for nonconvex-concave minimax problems is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left( L^4\varepsilon^{-4} \right)$. As far as we know, this is the first completely parameter-free algorithm for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems, and it is also the completely parameter-free algorithm which achieves the best iteration complexity in single loop method for solving nonconvex-concave minimax problems. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed PF-AGP algorithm.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Hallucination Detection for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prone to hallucinations - generating unreliable outputs that are unfaithful to their inputs, external facts or internally inconsistent. In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims at building the theoretical foundations for manifold learning algorithms in the space of absolutely continuous probability measures on a compact and convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, metrized with the Wasserstein-2 distance $\mathrm{W}$. We begin by introducing a construction of submanifolds $\Lambda$ of probability measures equipped with metric $\mathrm{W}_\Lambda$, the geodesic restriction of $W$ to $\Lambda$. In contrast to other constructions, these submanifolds are not necessarily flat, but still allow for local linearizations in a similar fashion to Riemannian submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show how the latent manifold structure of $(\Lambda,\mathrm{W}_{\Lambda})$ can be learned from samples $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$ of $\Lambda$ and pairwise extrinsic Wasserstein distances $\mathrm{W}$ only. In particular, we show that the metric space $(\Lambda,\mathrm{W}_{\Lambda})$ can be asymptotically recovered in the sense of Gromov--Wasserstein from a graph with nodes $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and edge weights $W(\lambda_i,\lambda_j)$. In addition, we demonstrate how the tangent space at a sample $\lambda$ can be asymptotically recovered via spectral analysis of a suitable "covariance operator" using optimal transport maps from $\lambda$ to sufficiently close and diverse samples $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$. The paper closes with some explicit constructions of submanifolds $\Lambda$ and numerical examples on the recovery of tangent spaces through spectral analysis.</description>

Abstract: Deep nonparametric regression, characterized by the utilization of deep neural networks to learn target functions, has emerged as a focus of research attention in recent years. Despite considerable progress in understanding convergence rates, the absence of asymptotic properties hinders rigorous statistical inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework that transforms the deep estimation paradigm into a platform conducive to conditional mean estimation, leveraging the conditional diffusion model. Theoretically, we develop an end-to-end convergence rate for the conditional diffusion model and establish the asymptotic normality of the generated samples. Consequently, we are equipped to construct confidence regions, facilitating robust statistical inference. Furthermore, through numerical experiments, we empirically validate the efficacy of our proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Adaptive, Rate-Optimal Hypothesis Testing in Nonparametric IV Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.09587v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new adaptive hypothesis test for inequality (e.g., monotonicity, convexity) and equality (e.g., parametric, semiparametric) restrictions on a structural function in a nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) model. Our test statistic is based on a modified leave-one-out sample analog of a quadratic distance between the restricted and unrestricted sieve two-stage least squares estimators. We provide computationally simple, data-driven choices of sieve tuning parameters and Bonferroni adjusted chi-squared critical values. Our test adapts to the unknown smoothness of alternative functions in the presence of unknown degree of endogeneity and unknown strength of the instruments. It attains the adaptive minimax rate of testing in $L^2$. That is, the sum of the supremum of type I error over the composite null and the supremum of type II error over nonparametric alternative models cannot be minimized by any other tests for NPIV models of unknown regularities. Confidence sets in $L^2$ are obtained by inverting the adaptive test. Simulations confirm that, across different strength of instruments and sample sizes, our adaptive test controls size and its finite-sample power greatly exceeds existing non-adaptive tests for monotonicity and parametric restrictions in NPIV models. Empirical applications to test for shape restrictions of differentiated products demand and of Engel curves are presented.</description>

      <title>Martian time-series unraveled: A multi-scale nested approach with factorial variational autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised source separation involves unraveling an unknown set of source signals recorded through a mixing operator, with limited prior knowledge about the sources, and only access to a dataset of signal mixtures. This problem is inherently ill-posed and is further challenged by the variety of timescales exhibited by sources in time series data from planetary space missions. As such, a systematic multi-scale unsupervised approach is needed to identify and separate sources at different timescales. Existing methods typically rely on a preselected window size that determines their operating timescale, limiting their capacity to handle multi-scale sources. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework by leveraging wavelet scattering spectra that provide a low-dimensional representation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between different non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Nested within this representation space, we develop a factorial variational autoencoder that is trained to probabilistically cluster sources at different timescales. To perform source separation, we use samples from clusters at multiple timescales obtained via the factorial variational autoencoder as prior information and formulate an optimization problem in the wavelet scattering spectra representation space. When applied to the entire seismic dataset recorded during the NASA InSight mission on Mars, containing sources varying greatly in timescale, our approach disentangles such different sources, e.g., minute-long transient one-sided pulses (known as "glitches") and structured ambient noises resulting from atmospheric activities that typically last for tens of minutes, and provides an opportunity to conduct further investigations into the isolated sources.</description>

      <title>Interaction Screening and Pseudolikelihood Approaches for Tensor Learning in Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two well known methods of Ising structure learning, namely the pseudolikelihood approach and the interaction screening approach, in the context of tensor recovery in $k$-spin Ising models. We show that both these approaches, with proper regularization, retrieve the underlying hypernetwork structure using a sample size logarithmic in the number of network nodes, and exponential in the maximum interaction strength and maximum node-degree. We also track down the exact dependence of the rate of tensor recovery on the interaction order $k$, that is allowed to grow with the number of samples and nodes, for both the approaches. We then provide a comparative discussion of the performance of the two approaches based on simulation studies, which also demonstrates the exponential dependence of the tensor recovery rate on the maximum coupling strength. Our tensor recovery methods are then applied on gene data taken from the Curated Microarray Database (CuMiDa), where we focus on understanding the important genes related to hepatocellular carcinoma.</description>

      <title>Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection using Masked Latent Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12550v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel time series anomaly detection method that achieves excellent detection accuracy while offering a superior level of explainability. Our proposed method, TimeVQVAE-AD, leverages masked generative modeling adapted from the cutting-edge time series generation method known as TimeVQVAE. The prior model is trained on the discrete latent space of a time-frequency domain. Notably, the dimensional semantics of the time-frequency domain are preserved in the latent space, enabling us to compute anomaly scores across different frequency bands, which provides a better insight into the detected anomalies. Additionally, the generative nature of the prior model allows for sampling likely normal states for detected anomalies, enhancing the explainability of the detected anomalies through counterfactuals. Our experimental evaluation on the UCR Time Series Anomaly archive demonstrates that TimeVQVAE-AD significantly surpasses the existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability. We provide our implementation on GitHub: https://github.com/ML4ITS/TimeVQVAE-AnomalyDetection.</description>

      <title>Optimal Decision Tree and Adaptive Submodular Ranking with Noisy Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15357</link>

Abstract: In pool-based active learning, the learner is given an unlabeled data set and aims to efficiently learn the unknown hypothesis by querying the labels of the data points. This can be formulated as the classical Optimal Decision Tree (ODT) problem: Given a set of tests, a set of hypotheses, and an outcome for each pair of test and hypothesis, our objective is to find a low-cost testing procedure (i.e., decision tree) that identifies the true hypothesis. This optimization problem has been extensively studied under the assumption that each test generates a deterministic outcome. However, in numerous applications, for example, clinical trials, the outcomes may be uncertain, which renders the ideas from the deterministic setting invalid. In this work, we study a fundamental variant of the ODT problem in which some test outcomes are noisy, even in the more general case where the noise is persistent, i.e., repeating a test gives the same noisy output. Our approximation algorithms provide guarantees that are nearly best possible and hold for the general case of a large number of noisy outcomes per test or per hypothesis where the performance degrades continuously with this number. We numerically evaluated our algorithms for identifying toxic chemicals and learning linear classifiers, and observed that our algorithms have costs very close to the information-theoretic minimum.</description>

      <title>Empirical Capacity Model for Self-Attention Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large pretrained self-attention neural networks, or transformers, have been very successful in various tasks recently. The performance of a model on a given task depends on its ability to memorize and generalize the training data. Large transformer models, which may have billions of parameters, in theory have a huge capacity to memorize content. However, the current algorithms for the optimization fall short of the theoretical capacity, and the capacity is also highly dependent on the content. In this paper, we focus on the memory capacity of these models obtained using common training algorithms and synthetic training data. Based on the results, we derive an empirical capacity model (ECM) for a generic transformer. The ECM can be used to design task-specific transformer models with an optimal number of parameters in cases where the target memorization capability of the task can be defined.</description>
