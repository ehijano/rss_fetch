      <title>On Energy-Dependent Neutron Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the energy-dependent neutron diffusion equation is widely employed in nuclear engineering, its status as an approximation to the transport equation is not yet completely understood, and several different approximations are in use to determine the diffusion coefficients. Past work on the theory underlying the diffusion approximation has often made use of asymptotic arguments; in the energy-dependent case, however, papers have appeared that differ substantially in their findings. Here we present a formal asymptotic derivation of the multigroup diffusion equation which addresses these differences, along with the varying and sometimes physically stringent assumptions employed in these works.
  Further, we show a way to exactly invert the relationship between flux and current in the P1 approximation, giving a matricial expression for the multigroup diffusion coefficient which is formally exact, has clear physical meaning, and which can be easily computed to arbitrary precision on the basis of cross-section data already produced by lattice calculations. The resulting 2-group diffusion coefficient for an infinite medium of hydrogen is calculated with Monte Carlo, and compared to the those deriving from the Cumulative Migration Method and from the out-scatter approximation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative phase nano-imaging with a laboratory source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the structure of matter at the nanoscale non destructively is a key capability enabled by X-ray imaging. One of the most powerful nano-imaging methods is X-ray ptychography, a coherent diffraction imaging technique that has become the go-to method at synchrotron facilities for applications ranging from brain imaging to battery materials. However, the requirements in terms of X-ray beam quality have limited its use to large synchrotron facilities and, to date, only one attempt has been made to translate the technique to a small-scale laboratory. To unleash the power of this technique to the broad user community of laboratory X-ray sources, there are outstanding questions to answer including whether the quantitativeness of the information is preserved in a laboratory despite the drastic decrease in X-ray flux of several orders of magnitude, with respect to synchrotron instruments. In this study not only we demonstrate that the quantitativeness of X-ray ptychography is preserved in a laboratory setting, but we also apply the method to the imaging of a brain tissue phantom. Finally, we describe the current challenges and limitations, and we set the basis for further development and future directions of quantitative nano-imaging with laboratory X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential method for atomic structure in the random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential (OEP) method for atomic structure calculations in the random phase approximation (RPA). In particular, we develop a finite-element framework that employs a polynomial mesh with element nodes placed according to the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto scheme, high-order $\mathcal{C}^0$-continuous Lagrange polynomial basis functions, and Gauss-Legendre quadrature for spatial integration. We employ distinct polynomial degrees for the orbitals, Hartree potential, and RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential. Through representative examples, we verify the accuracy of the developed framework, assess the fidelity of one-parameter double-hybrid functionals constructed with RPA correlation, and develop a machine-learned model for the RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential at the level of the generalized gradient approximation, based on the kernel method and linear regression.</description>

      <title>Accurate atomic correlation and total energies for correlation consistent effective core potentials II: Rb-Xe elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) to perform exact or nearly exact correlation and total energy calculations for the fifth-row elements (Rb-Xe). Total energies are calculated using various correlated methods: configuration interaction (CI), coupled-cluster (CC) up to perturbative quadruple excitations whenever feasible, and stochastic quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches. In order to estimate the energy at the complete basis set (CBS) limit, the basis sets are constructed systematically through aug-cc-p(C)VnZ for each ccECP and further extrapolated to the CBS limit within the corresponding methods. Kinetic energies are evaluated at the FCI/CISD level to provide insights into the electron density and localization of the ccECPs. We also provide data sets for widely used diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) to quantify fixed-node biases with single-reference trial wavefunctions. These comprehensive benchmarks validate the accuracy of ccECPs within the CC, CI, and QMC methodologies, thus providing accurate and tested valence-only Hamiltonians for many-body electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of Lagrangian velocity structure functions using acceleration statistics and a spatial-temporal perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental relation in Lagrangian Kolmogorov theory is concerned with inertial range scaling of the second-order velocity structure function over intermediate time lags at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. However, the scaling is not well observed, and it is uncertain whether the scaling constant ($C_0$) truly approaches a constant value at asymptotic Reynolds numbers. In this paper, direct numerical simulation of forced isotropic turbulence at Taylor-scale Reynolds numbers between 140 and 1300 is used to help advance understanding in this subject. Uncertainties arising from modest simulation time spans are addressed by expressing the velocity structure function in terms of the acceleration autocorrelation, which suggests that $C_0$ may be sensitive to intermittency effects, leading to a sustained, although weak, Reynolds number dependence. The Lagrangian velocity increment is examined from a spatial-temporal perspective, as a combination of convective (spatial) and local (temporal) contributions, which are subject to a strong but incomplete mutual cancellation dependent on Reynolds number and time lag. The convective increment is strongly influenced by the particle displacement, which is driven by large-scale dynamics and can thus grow into inertial range dimensions in space within just a few Kolmogorov time scales, without fully satisfying classical Lagrangian inertial-range requirements. An overall conclusion in this work is that both the limited range of time scales (narrower than for length scales) and the effects of particle displacements have significant roles in the observed behavior of the second-order Lagrangian velocity structure function.</description>

      <title>Full-Wave Optical Modeling of Leaf Internal Light Scattering Dynamics with Potential Applications for Early Detection of Foliar Fungal Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17132v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light interacting with plant leaves undergoes reflection, transmission, scattering, and absorption, which together determine leaf optical properties. Changes in leaf architecture disrupt internal light scattering dynamics and consequently affect photosynthetic performance. Previous studies on internal leaf light scattering have primarily relied on ray-tracing approaches (e.g., Raytran) or radiative-transfer models (e.g., PROSPECT). However, these high-frequency approximations cannot capture diffraction and coherent multiple scattering in wavelength-scale leaf tissues, unlike full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Here, we employ GPU-accelerated Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations to model internal light scattering dynamics using segmented cross-section image geometries of representative dicot and monocot leaves with wavelength-dependent complex refractive indices. The simulations accurately reproduce the reflectance and transmittance characteristics of healthy leaves, showing strong agreement with the PROSPECT model, with average Lin's concordance values of 0.8962 for dicot leaves and 0.7849 for monocot leaves. We further simulate early-stage necrotrophic fungal infection by modeling melanized hyphae penetrating the cuticle and upper epidermis. Diseased leaves exhibit a pronounced reduction in visible green reflectance and a marked suppression of the near-infrared reflectance plateau, consistent with experimental observations. Remaining discrepancies in the visible band are expected to be reduced through more advanced geometric and material modeling. This proof-of-concept study presents a full-wave FDTD optical modeling framework for plant-leaf light scattering, enabling physics-based analysis of internal scattering before and after early-stage fungal penetration and supporting the use of light scattering as an indicator for pre-symptomatic plant fungal disease detection.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Approach for Modeling Multiscale Complex Fluids at the Fast Relaxation Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new asymptotic strategy for general micro-macro models which analyze complex viscoelastic fluids governed by coupled multiscale dynamics. In such models, the elastic stress appearing in the macroscopic continuum equation is derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, which makes direct numerical simulations computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce a formal asymptotic scheme that expands the density function around an equilibrium distribution, thereby reducing the high computational cost associated with the fully coupled microscopic processes while still maintaining the dynamic microscopic feedback in explicit expressions. The proposed asymptotic expansion is based on a detailed physical scaling law which characterizes the multiscale balance at the fast relaxation limit of the microscopic state. An asymptotic closure model for the macroscopic fluid equation is then derived according to the explicit asymptotic density expansion. Furthermore, the resulting closure model preserves the energy-dissipation law inherited from the original fully coupled multiscale system. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the asymptotic density formula and the corresponding flow velocity equations in several micro-macro models. This new asymptotic strategy offers a promising approach for efficient computations of a wide range of multiscale complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, Structural, and Electronic Properties of CrOCl with the PBE Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CrOCl is a van der Waals-layered insulator with an antiferromagnetic ground state, making it a promising platform for exfoliation and the exploration of low-dimensional magnetism. An accurate ab initio description is therefore essential. Previous density-functional studies have shown that DFT+$U$ calculations may erroneously favor ferromagnetic order depending on the choice of parametrization, an issue that cannot be remedied by simply adjusting the value of $U$. Here, we demonstrate that an explicit Hubbard correction is unnecessary: the PBE functional correctly reproduces the AFM ground state while simultaneously improving the description of structural properties. Moreover, PBE provides a reliable account of the electronic structure. These findings clarify the role of correlation effects in CrOCl and identify PBE as a robust starting point for future ab initio studies of CrOCl-based materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17654v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis on how to build and train neural networks to estimate the spatial distribution of scattered radiation fields for radiation protection dosimetry in medical radiation fields, such as those found in interventional radiology and cardiology. We present three different synthetically generated datasets with increasing complexity for training, using a Monte-Carlo Simulation application based on Geant4. On those datasets, we evaluate convolutional and fully connected architectures of neural networks to demonstrate which design decisions work well for reconstructing the fluence and spectra distributions over the spatial domain of such radiation fields. All our datasets, as well as our training pipeline, are published as open source in separate repositories.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Broken Symmetry Phase of Solid Hydrogen: A Neural Network Variational Monte Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystal structure of high-pressure solid hydrogen remains a fundamental open problem. Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications.</description>

      <title>Condensation dynamics of sticky and anchored flexible biopolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells regulate gene expression in part by forming DNA-protein condensates in the nucleus. While existing theories describe the equilibrium size and stability of such condensates, their dynamics remain less understood. Here, we use coarse-grained 3D Brownian-dynamics simulations to study how long, end-anchored biopolymers condense over time due to transient crosslinking. By tracking how clusters nucleate, merge, and disappear, we identify two dominant dynamical pathways, ripening and merging, that govern the progression from an uncompacted chain to a single condensate. We show how microscopic kinetic parameters, protein density, and mechanical constraints shape these pathways. Using insights from the simulations, we construct a minimal mechanistic free-energy model that captures the observed scaling behavior. Together, these results clarify the dynamical determinants of DNA and chromatin reorganization on timescales relevant to gene regulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study opinion formation in a society where agents interact on a modular network generated using a stochastic block model (SBM). Opinion dynamics is modeled through the Biswas-Chatterjee-Sen (BChS) kinetic exchange model, in which agents undergo pairwise interactions that could be positive or negative. By tuning the relative strength of intra- and inter-group connectivity inherent to the SBM, as well as the disagreement probability, we identify distinct collective phases. In particular, we observe a robust regime with strong intragroup ordering but no global consensus, in addition to fully ordered and disordered states. These results demonstrate how modular interaction structure can qualitatively alter collective opinion dynamics and hinder consensus formation.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Entanglement in Mixed-Particle Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an entanglement witness that identifies off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) -- a distinctive form of entanglement -- in systems containing both fermionic and bosonic particles. By analyzing the particle-hole reduced density matrices of each subsystem, the approach detects ODLRO independently in both fermionic and bosonic sectors and identifies when long-range order develops across the entire mixed-particle system. The witness also quantifies the magnitude of ODLRO within each particle type, revealing how fermionic and bosonic correlations combine to form the total entanglement of the system, including a bosonic condensation of particle-hole pairs driven by many-body correlations rather than particle statistics. Using the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model, we show how the transition from ODLRO localized to one particle type to ODLRO shared by both particle types captures the onset of collective entanglement in a mixed-particle environment, providing new insight into systems where fermionic and bosonic correlations coexist.</description>

Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that integrate coupled physical equations forward in time are the traditional tools for simulating atmospheric processes and forecasting weather. With recent advancements in deep learning, AI-based Weather Prediction models that rely on neural network architectures$\unicode{x2013}$Neural Weather Models (NeWMs)$\unicode{x2013}$have emerged as competent medium-range NWP emulators, with performances that compare favorably to state-of-the-art NWP models. However, they are commonly trained on reanalyses with limited spatial resolution (e.g., 0.25{\deg} horizontal grid spacing), which smooths out key features of weather systems. For example, tropical cyclones (TCs)$\unicode{x2013}$among the most impactful weather events due to their devastating effects on human activities$\unicode{x2013}$are challenging to forecast, as extrema are smoothed in deterministic forecasts at 0.25{\deg} resolution. To address this, we use our best observational estimates of wind gusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing models on NeWM outputs. Applied to Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2, the post-processing models produce accurate and reliable forecasts of TC intensity up to five days ahead. Our post-processing algorithm is tracking-independent, preventing full misses, and we demonstrate that even linear models extract predictive information from NeWM outputs beyond what is encoded in their initial conditions. While spatial masking improves probabilistic forecast consistency, we do not find clear advantages of convolutional architectures over simple multilayer perceptrons for our NeWM post-processing purposes. Overall, by combining the efficiency of NeWMs with a lightweight, tracking-independent postprocessing framework, our approach improves the accessibility of global TC intensity forecasts, marking a step toward their democratization.</description>

      <title>An Optimally Accurate Lanczos Algorithm in the Matrix Product State Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation</description>

      <title>Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ans\"{a}tze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Focusing on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We provide evidence that the nature of the instability stems from stiffness of the dynamics of the variational parameters, despite the absence of stiffness in the exact quantum dynamics. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.</description>

      <title>Local Order Average-Atom Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.</description>

      <title>Training Deep Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on nine standard forward PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in settings where the others diverge.</description>

      <title>Beyond Exascale: Dataflow Domain Translation on a Cerebras Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is essential across scientific and engineering domains. Commonly used domain decomposition methods are unable to simultaneously deliver both high simulation rate and high utilization in network computing environments. In particular, Exascale systems deliver only a small fraction their peak performance for these workloads. This paper introduces the novel Domain Translation algorithm, designed to overcome these limitations. On a cluster of 64 Cerebras CS-3 systems, we use this method to demonstrate unprecedented cluster performance across a range of metrics: we show simulations running in excess of 1.6 million time steps per second; we also demonstrate perfect weak scaling at 88% of peak performance. At this cluster scale, our implementation provides 112 PFLOP/s in a power-unconstrained environment, and 57 GFLOP/J in a power-limited environment. We illustrate the method by applying the shallow-water equations to model a tsunami following an asteroid impact at 460m-resolution on a planetary scale.</description>

      <title>Efficient Monte-Carlo sampling of metastable systems using non-local collective variable updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte-Carlo simulations are widely used to simulate complex molecular systems, but standard approaches suffer from metastability. Lately, the use of non-local proposal updates in a collective-variable (CV) space has been proposed in several works. Here, we generalize these approaches and explicitly spell out an algorithm for non-linear CVs and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove reversibility of the resulting scheme and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples, observing a substantial performance increase compared to methods based on overdamped Langevin dynamics as considered previously. Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems.</description>
