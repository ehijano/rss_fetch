      <title>The Performance of Seeded Free-Electron Lasers Through Dispersion Strength Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, external seeded free electron lasers (FELs) have achieved significant advancements across various disciplines, progressively establishing themselves as indispensable tools in fields ranging from fundamental science to industrial applications. The performance of seeded FELs is critically dependent on the quality of the frequency up-conversion process. Optimized conditions for seeded FELs are typically considered as the maximization of the bunching factor. This paper discusses alternative perspectives on the optimization criteria for seeded FELs by analyzing the impact of dispersion strength on their overall performance. We investigate the relationship among the required dispersion strength for achieving the maximum bunching factor, maximum pulse energy, and optimal energy stability through theoretical analysis, simulation calculations, and experimental explorations. Additionally, the direct observation of pulse splitting emphasizes the consideration of trade-off between pulse energy and temporal coherence in seeded FELs. These results provide valuable insights and practical guidance for controlling the pulse characteristics of seeded FELs, contributing to the tuning and optimization of FEL facilities.</description>

      <title>Meter-scale supersonic gas jets for multi-GeV laser-plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pushing the high energy frontier of laser wakefield electron acceleration (LWFA) to 10 GeV and beyond requires extending the propagation of relativistic intensity pulses to ~1 m in a low density ($N_e\sim 10^{17} cm^{-3}$) plasma waveguide. We present the development and characterization of two types of supersonic gas jet for meter-scale multi-GeV laser wakefield accelerators. The first type is a 30-cm long single-module gas jet, which demonstrates good axial uniformity using hydrogen, the preferred working gas for LWFA. The second type is a modular jet composed of multiple 11-cm-long modules. Longitudinal density profile control is demonstrated with a 2-module (22 cm long) hydrogen jet using gas valve trigger timing. A 1.0-m-long jet is then assembled from 9 modules, and generation of 1.0-m long hydrogen plasma is demonstrated using a femtosecond Bessel beam. To our knowledge, this is the longest gas jet laser plasma yet generated.</description>

      <title>Experimental generation of extreme electron beams for advanced accelerator applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter we report on the experimental generation of high energy (10 GeV), ultra-short (fs-duration), ultra-high current (0.1 MA), petawatt peak power electron beams in a particle accelerator. These extreme beams enable the exploration of a new frontier of high intensity beam-light and beam-matter interactions broadly relevant across fields ranging from laboratory astrophysics to strong field quantum electrodynamics and ultra-fast quantum chemistry. We demonstrate our ability to generate and control the properties of these electron beams by means of a laser-electron beam shaping technique. This experimental demonstration opens the door to on-the-fly customization of extreme beam current profiles for desired experiments and is poised to benefit a broad swathe of cross-cutting applications of relativistic electron beams.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Machine Learning for Single-Shot Measurement of Free Electron Laser Pulse Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron beam accelerators are essential in many scientific and technological fields. Their operation relies heavily on the stability and precision of the electron beam. Traditional diagnostic techniques encounter difficulties in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of electron beams. Particularly in the context of free-electron lasers (FELs), it is fundamentally impossible to measure the lasing-on and lasingoff electron power profiles for a single electron bunch. This is a crucial hurdle in the exact reconstruction of the photon pulse profile. To overcome this hurdle, we developed a machine learning model that predicts the temporal power profile of the electron bunch in the lasing-off regime using machine parameters that can be obtained when lasing is on. The model was statistically validated and showed superior predictions compared to the state-of-the-art batch calibrations. The work we present here is a critical element for a virtual pulse reconstruction diagnostic (VPRD) tool designed to reconstruct the power profile of individual photon pulses without requiring repeated measurements in the lasing-off regime. This promises to significantly enhance the diagnostic capabilities in FELs at large.</description>
