      <title>On periodic families in the stable stems of height two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover 110 infinite periodic families in the 2-primary stable homotopy groups of spheres. These families appear in seventeen different congruence classes of degrees modulo 192, four of them consist of simple 4-torsion elements, and another two of simple 8-torsion. They all vanish in the homotopy groups of the spectrum TMF of topological modular forms, but we show that they are detected in the fixed-points of TMF with respect to an Atkin--Lehner involution.</description>

      <title>On the chain rule in Goodwillie calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the Arone-Ching chain rule for Goodwillie derivatives by showing that for any pair of reduced finitary functors $F \colon \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{E}$ and $G \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ between differentiable $\infty$-categories, there is an equivalence $\partial_*(FG) \simeq \partial_*F \circ_{\partial_*{\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{D}}}} \partial_*G$. This confirms a conjecture of Lurie. The proof of this theorem consists of two parts, which are of independent interest. We first show that the Goodwillie derivatives can be refined to a lax functor $\partial_* \colon \mathrm{Diff} \to \mathrm{Pr}^{\mathrm{Sym}}_{\mathrm{St}}$ from the $(\infty, 2)$-category of differentiable $\infty$-categories and reduced finitary functors to a certain $(\infty, 2)$-category of generalized symmetric sequences. Such a lax structure on the Goodwillie derivatives was long believed to exist, but has not been constructed prior to this work. We then finish the proof by studying the interaction of this lax functor with Koszul duality. In order to do so, we establish a new universal property of the bar-cobar adjunction.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic Sectional category, Topological complexity, and Homotopic distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06969v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the properties of sectional category, topological complexity and homotopic distance are in fact derived from a small number of basic properties, which, once established, lead to all the others without further recourse to topology. On the other hand, there are several variants of these notions: with open covers or else Whitehead-Ganea constructions, also with spaces and maps that are unpointed or else pointed, fibrewise, equivariant, etc. or even with algebraic models of spaces and maps. These are two reasons why we build an axiomatic approach to all these notions, based on just three simple axioms.
  We also introduce the notion of `lifting category' which unifies the notions of sectional category, topological complexity, and homotopic distance, all of which are special cases of lifting category.</description>

      <title>A matrix criterion and algorithmic approach for the Peterson hit problem: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Peterson hit problem in algebraic topology is to explicitly determine the dimension of the quotient space $Q\mathcal P_k = \mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}\mathcal P_k$ in positive degrees, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ denotes the polynomial algebra in $k$ variables over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$, considered as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Current approaches to this problem still rely heavily on manual computations, which are highly prone to errors due to the intricate nature of the underlying calculations. To date, no efficient algorithm implemented in any computer algebra system has been made publicly available to tackle this problem in a systematic manner.
  Motivated by the above, in this work, which is considered as Part I of our project, we first establish a criterion based entirely on linear algebra for determining whether a given homogeneous polynomial is "hit". Accordingly, we describe the dimensions of the hit spaces. This leads to a practical and reliable computational method for determining the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_k$ for arbitrary $k$ and any positive degrees, with the support of a computer algebra system. We then give a concrete implementation of the obtained results as novel algorithms in \textsc{SageMath}. As an application, our algorithm demonstrates that the manually computed result presented in the recent work of Sum and Tai [15] for the dimension of $Q\mathcal{P}_5$ in degree $2^{6}$ is not correct. Furthermore, our algorithm determines that $\dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} = 1985,$ which falls within the range $1984 \leq \dim(Q\mathcal{P}_5)_{2^{7}} \leq 1990$ as estimated in [15].</description>

      <title>Positivity in $T$-Equivariant $K$-theory of partial flag varieties associated to Kac-Moody groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sign-alternation of the product structure constants in the basis dual to the basis consisting of the structure sheaves of Schubert varieties in the torus-equivariant Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on the partial flag varieties $G/P$ associated to an arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody group $G$, where $P$ is any parabolic subgroup of finite type. This extends the previous work of Kumar from $G/B$ to $G/P$. When $G$ is of finite type, i.e., it is a semisimple group, then it was proved by Anderson-Griffeth-Miller.</description>
