      <title>Weak convergence analysis for non-linear collisional induced breakage equation with singular kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of collisional breakage in particulate processes has garnered significant interest due to its wide-ranging applications in fields such as milling, astrophysics, and disk formation. This study investigates the analysis of the pure collisional breakage equation (CBE), characterized by its nonlinear nature with presence of locally bounded collision kernels and singular breakage kernels. Employing a finite volume scheme (FVS), we discretize the continuous equation and investigate the weak convergence of the approximated solution of the conservative scheme towards the continuous solution of CBE. A weight function is introduced to ensure the conservation of the scheme. The non-negativity of the approximated solutions is also shown with the assistance of the mathematical induction approach. Our approach relies on the weak $L^1$ compactness argument, complemented by introducing a stable condition on the time step.</description>

      <title>Local and nonlocal critical growth anisotropic quasilinear elliptic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove new multiplicity results for a critical growth anisotropic quasilinear elliptic system that is coupled through a subcritical perturbation term. We identify a certain scaling for the system and a parameter {\gamma} related to this scaling that determines the geometry of the associated variational functional. This leads to a natural classification of different nonlinear regimes for the system in terms of scaling properties of the perturbation term. We give three different types of multiplicity results in the three regimes {\gamma} = 1, {\gamma} &gt; 1, and {\gamma} &lt; 1. Proofs of our multiplicity results are based on a new abstract critical point theorem for symmetric functionals on product spaces, which we prove using the piercing property of the Z2-cohomological index of Fadell and Rabinowitz. This abstract result only requires a local (PS) condition and is therefore applicable to systems with critical growth. It is of independent interest as it has wide applicability to many different types of critical elliptic systems. We also indicate how it can be applied to obtain similar multiplicity results for nonlocal systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Runge approximation for damped nonlocal wave equations and simultaneous determination results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to establish new uniqueness results for Calder\'on type inverse problems related to damped nonlocal wave equations. To achieve this goal we extend the theory of very weak solutions to our setting, which allows to deduce an optimal Runge approximation theorem. With this result at our disposal, we can prove simultaneous determination results in the linear and semilinear regime.</description>

      <title>On the wave equation with Coulomb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave/Schr\"{o}dinger equations with potentials naturally originates from both the quantum physics and the study of nonlinear equations. The distractive Coulomb potential is a quantum mechanical description of distractive Coulomb force between two particles with the same charge. The spectrum of the operator $-\Delta +1/|x|$ is well known and there are also a few results on the Strichartz estimates, local and global well-posedness and scattering result about the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a distractive Coulomb potential. In the contrast, much less is known for the global and asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the corresponding wave equations with a Coulomb potential.
  In this work we consider the wave equation with a distractive Coulomb potential in dimensions $d\geq 3$. We first describe the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions to the linear homogeneous Coulomb wave equation, especially their energy distribution property and scattering profiles, then show that the radial finite-energy solutions to suitable defocusing Coulomb wave equation are defined for all time and scatter in both two time directions, by establishing a family of radial Strichartz estimates and combining them with the decay of the potential energy.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the focusing NLH with a potential beyond the mass-energy threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the focusing nonlinear Hartree equation with a Kato potential $$ i\partial_t u +\Delta u - Vu = -(|\cdot|^{-\gamma} \ast |u|^2)u, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^d $$ under some assumptions on the potential $V$. We prove the blow up versus global existence dichotomy for solutions beyond the threshold, based on the method from Duyckaerts-Roudenko [6].
  Furthermore, our result compensates for the one of in [13] below that threshold.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of trajectory statistical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a recently introduced general framework for trajectory statistical solutions is considered, and the question of convergence of families of such solutions is addressed. Conditions for the convergence are given which rely on natural assumptions related to a priori estimates for the individual solutions of typical approximating problems. The first main result is based on the assumption that the superior limit of suitable families of compact subsets of carriers of the family of trajectory statistical solutions be included in the set of solutions of the limit problem. The second main result is a version of the former in the case in which the approximating family is associated with a well-posed system. These two results are then applied to the inviscid limit of incompressible Navier-Stokes system in two and three spatial dimensions, showing, in particular, the existence of trajectory statistical solutions to the two- and three-dimensional Euler equations, in the context of weak and dissipative solutions, respectively. Another application of the second main result is on the Galerkin approximations of statistical solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of minimal mass blow-up solution for the 2D cubic Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the 2D cubic (mass-critical) Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, \begin{equation*} \partial_t\phi+\partial_{x_1}(\Delta \phi+\phi^3)=0,\quad (t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{R}^{2}, \end{equation*} we prove that there exist no finite/infinite time blow-up solution with minimal mass in the energy space. This nonexistence result is in contrast to the one obtained by Martel-Merle-Rapha\"el [17] for the mass-critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries (gKdV) equation. The proof relies on a refined ODE argument related to the modulation theory and a modified energy-virial Lyapunov functional with a monotonicity property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a transmission problem, in population dynamics, between two juxtaposed habitats. In each habitat, we consider a generalized diffusion equation composed by the Laplace operator and a biharmonic term. We consider that the coefficients in front of each term could be negative or null. Using semigroups theory and functional calculus, we give some relation between coefficients to obtain the existence and the uniqueness of the classical solution in $L^p$-spaces.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation in high dimensional critical electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation with scaling-critical electromagnetic potentials in dimensions $n\geq3$. The decay assumption on the magnetic potentials is critical, including the case of the Coulomb potential. Our approach introduces novel techniques, notably the construction of Schwartz kernels for the localized Schr\"odinger propagator, which separates the antipodal points of $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, in these scaling critical electromagnetic fields. This method enables us to prove the $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)\to L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the localized Schr\"odinger propagator, as well as global Strichartz estimates. Our results provide a positive answer to the open problem posed in arXiv:0901.4024 arXiv:1611.04805 arXiv:0806.0778, and fill a longstanding gap left by arXiv:arXiv:0705.0546 arXiv:archive/0608699.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of solution for ultrahyperbolic equations with lower order terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove a variety of uniqueness results for ultrahyperbolic equations with general space and time dependent lower order terms. We address the problem of determining uniqueness of solutions from boundary data as well as when the data is prescribed on an interior subset. Furthermore, we also present the case when the domain may change with respect to any one time component and obtain analogous results. Our main tool for this purpose is Carleman estimate. We obtain different uniqueness results depending on the location of the reference point for the Carleman estimate relative to the domain.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based Koopman Autoencoder for Linearizing Fisher's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Transformer-based Koopman autoencoder is proposed for linearizing Fisher's reaction-diffusion equation. The primary focus of this study is on using deep learning techniques to find complex spatiotemporal patterns in the reaction-diffusion system. The emphasis is on not just solving the equation but also transforming the system's dynamics into a more comprehensible, linear form. Global coordinate transformations are achieved through the autoencoder, which learns to capture the underlying dynamics by training on a dataset with 60,000 initial conditions. Extensive testing on multiple datasets was used to assess the efficacy of the proposed model, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict the system's evolution as well as to generalize. We provide a thorough comparison study, comparing our suggested design to a few other comparable methods using experiments on various PDEs, such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the Burger's equation. Results show improved accuracy, highlighting the capabilities of the Transformer-based Koopman autoencoder. The proposed architecture in is significantly ahead of other architectures, in terms of solving different types of PDEs using a single architecture. Our method relies entirely on the data, without requiring any knowledge of the underlying equations. This makes it applicable to even the datasets where the governing equations are not known.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a heterogeneous Allen-Cahn equation to weighted mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a variational model for heterogeneous phase separation, based on a diffuse interface energy with moving wells. Our main result identifies the asymptotic behavior of the first variation of the phase field energies as the width of the diffuse interface vanishes. This convergence result allows us to deduce a Gibbs-Thomson relation for heterogeneous surface tensions. Proceeding from this information, we prove that (weak) solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation with space dependent potential converge to a BV solution of weighted mean curvature flow, under an energy convergence hypothesis. Additionally, relying on the relative energy technique, we establish a weak-strong uniqueness principle for solutions of weighted mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Asymptically full measure sets of almost-periodic solutions for the NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global dynamics of solutions to a family of nonlinear Schr\"odinger %(NLS) equations on the circle, with a smooth convolution potential and Gevrey regular initial data. Our main result is the construction of an asymptotically full measure set of time almost-periodic solutions, whose hulls are invariant tori. Specifically, we show that for most choices of the convolution potential there exists a bi-Lipschitz map from a ball in the space of linear solutions to the space of initial data, such that all linear solutions with frequencies satisfying a non-resonance condition are mapped to initial data giving rise to an almost-periodic solution. As a consequence, we establish that the Gevrey norm of many initial data remains approximately constant in time and hence the elliptic fixed point at the origin is Lyapunov statistically stable with respect to such a norm. Furthermore, we construct a Cantor foliation of the phase space, where regions corresponding to positive actions are foliated by invariant maximal tori. This result generalizes the classical KAM theory in the infinite-dimensional setting, providing a statistical description of the global dynamics near the fixed point. Our work suggests that diffusive solutions should be looked for in spaces of lower regularity, in line with recent findings in the theory of Hamiltonian PDEs</description>

      <title>Linear hyperbolic equations in a double null foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bianchi identities for the Weyl curvature tensor of a spacetime $(M, g)$ solving the vacuum Einstein equations in a double null foliation exhibit a hyperbolic structure, which can be used to obtain detailed nonlinear estimates on the null Weyl tensor components. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we discuss existence and uniqueness for solutions of first-order linear hyperbolic systems of equations in a double null foliation on an arbitrary spacetime, with initial data posed on a past null hypersurface $\underline C_0 \cup C_0$. We prove a global existence and uniqueness theorem for these systems. Then we discuss the relationship between these systems, the Bianchi equations, and the linearized Bianchi equations (the linearized Bianchi equations are obtained from the usual Bianchi equations by replacing the null Weyl tensor components with unknown tensorfields). We derive a novel algebraic constraint which must be satisfied, at every point in the spacetime, by tensorfields satisfying the linearized Bianchi equations.</description>

      <title>Linear Reduction and Homotopy Control for Steady Drift-Diffusion Systems in Narrow Convex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops and applies results, originally introduced in earlier work, for the existence of homotopy curves, terminating at a desired solution. We describe the principal hypotheses and results in section two; right inverse approximation is at the core of the theory. We apply this theory in section three to the basic drift-diffusion equations. The carrier densities are not assumed to satisfy Boltzmann statistics and the Einstein relations are not assumed. By proving the existence of the homotopy curve, we validate the underlying computational framework of a predictor/corrector scheme, where the corrector utilizes an approximate Newton method. The analysis depends on the assumption of domains of narrow width. However, no assumption is made regarding the domain diameter.</description>

      <title>Exciting games and Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a competition between $d+1$ players, and aim to identify the "most exciting game'' of this kind. This is translated, mathematically, into a stochastic optimization problem over martingales that live on the $d$-dimensional subprobability simplex $\Delta$ and terminate on the vertices of $\Delta$ (so-called win-martingales), with a cost function related to a scaling limit of Shannon entropies. We uncover a surprising connection between this problem and the seemingly unrelated field of Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations: If $g$ solves \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} g(x)=\log \det\left(\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 g(x)\right), \quad \, \ \ \ \ \, \, \, \, x \in \Delta, \\ g(x)=\infty, \quad \quad \quad \quad \ \ \ \ \ \quad \quad \, \ \ \ \ \ x\in \partial \Delta, \end{cases} \end{equation*} then the winning-probability of the players in the most exciting game is described by $$dM_s=\sqrt{\frac{2 (\nabla^2 g(M_s))^{-1}}{1-s} } \, dB_s.$$ To formalize this, a detailed quantitative analysis of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for $g$ is crucial. This is then leveraged to prove that $M$ is indeed an optimal win-martingale.</description>

      <title>Hanke-Raus heuristic rule for iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent method termed as iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) method to solve nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method converges to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) based on the method suggested by Hanke and Raus, and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori knowledge of the noise level. We show that the method terminates in finitely many steps in case of noisy data and has regularizing features. Further, we discuss the convergence rates of the method using well-known source and other related conditions under HPCR as well as discrepancy principle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes both the regularization properties and convergence rates of a stochastic gradient method using a heuristic type rule in the setting of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Finally, we provide the numerical experiments to showcase the practical efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Defending Against Diverse Attacks in Federated Learning Through Consensus-Based Bi-Level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges in many machine learning applications, particularly in the setting of distributed training and federated learning, where malicious agents seek to corrupt the training process with the goal of jeopardizing and compromising the performance and reliability of the final models. In this paper, we address the problem of robust federated learning in the presence of such attacks by formulating the training task as a bi-level optimization problem. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the resilience of consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), an interacting multi-particle metaheuristic optimization method, in adversarial settings. Specifically, we provide a global convergence analysis of CB$^2$O in mean-field law in the presence of malicious agents, demonstrating the robustness of CB$^2$O against a diverse range of attacks. Thereby, we offer insights into how specific hyperparameter choices enable to mitigate adversarial effects. On the practical side, we extend CB$^2$O to the clustered federated learning setting by proposing FedCB$^2$O, a novel interacting multi-particle system, and design a practical algorithm that addresses the demands of real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the FedCB$^2$O algorithm against label-flipping attacks in decentralized clustered federated learning scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in practical contexts.</description>

      <title>On Third-Order Evolution Systems Describing Pseudo-Spherical or Spherical Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of third-order evolution equations of the form \begin{equation*} \left\{
  \begin{array}{l}
  \displaystyle u_{t}=F\left(x,t,u,u_x,u_{xx},u_{xxx},v,v_x,v_{xx},v_{xxx}\right),
  \displaystyle v_{t}=G\left(x,t,u,u_x,u_{xx},u_{xxx},v,v_x,v_{xx},v_{xxx}\right),
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation*} describing pseudos-pherical (\textbf{pss}) or spherical surfaces (\textbf{ss}), meaning that, their generic solutions $(u(x,t), v(x,t))$ provide metrics, with coordinates $(x,t)$, on open subsets of the plane, with constant curvature $K=-1$ or $K=1$. These systems can be described as the integrability conditions of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued linear problems, with $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}(2,\R)$ or $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{su}(2)$, when $K=-1$, $K=1$, respectively. We obtain characterization and also classification results. Applications of these results provide new examples and new families of such systems, which also contain systems of coupled KdV and mKdV-type equations and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. Additionally, this theory is applied to derive a B\"acklund transformation for the coupled KdV system.</description>

      <title>Estimates controlling a function by only its radial derivative and applications to stable solutions of elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13033v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish two new estimates which control a function (after subtracting its average) in $L^1$ by only the $L^1$ norm of its radial derivative. While the interior estimate holds for all superharmonic functions, the boundary version is much more delicate. It requires the function to be a stable solution of a semilinear elliptic equation with a nonnegative, nondecreasing, and convex nonlinearity. As an application, our estimates provide quantitative proofs of two results established by contradiction-compactness proofs in [Cabre, Figalli, Ros-Oton, and Serra, Acta Math. 224 (2020)]. We recall that this work proved the H\"older regularity of stable solutions to semilinear elliptic equations in the optimal range of dimensions $n \leq 9$.</description>

  {where $D= \left(\Omega \cup {\Pi_2} \cup (\partial\Omega\cap\overline{\Pi_2})\right)$ and $D^c$ is the complement of $D$, $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a non empty open set, $\Pi_{1}$, $\Pi_{2}$ are open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus{\bar \Omega }$ such that $\overline{{\Pi_{1}} \cup {\Pi_{{2}}}}= \mathbb{R}^n\setminus{\Omega}$, $\Pi_{1} \cap \Pi_{{2}}= \emptyset$ and $\Omega\cup \Pi_2$ is a bounded set with smooth boundary}, $\lambda &gt;0$ is a real parameter, $ 0 &lt; q &lt; 1&lt;p $, $n&gt;2$ and

  We first present a functional setting to study any problem involving $\mathcal L$ under mixed boundary conditions in the presence of concave-convex power nonlinearity, {for a suitable range of $\lambda$, $q$ and $p$}. Our article also contains results related to Picone's identity, strong maximum principles and comparison principles.</description>

      <title>Real eternal PDE solutions are not complex entire: a quadratic parabolic example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In parabolic or hyperbolic PDEs, solutions which remain uniformly bounded for all real times $t=r\in\mathbb{R}$ are often called PDE entire or eternal. For example, consider the quadratic parabolic PDE \begin{equation*} \label{*} w_t=w_{xx}+6w^2-\lambda, \tag{*} \end{equation*} for $0&lt;x&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, under Neumann boundary conditions. By its gradient-like structure, all real eternal non-equilibrium orbits $\Gamma(r)$ of \eqref{*} are heteroclinic among equilibria $w=W_n(x)$. All nontrivial real $W_n$ are rescaled and properly translated real-valued Weierstrass elliptic functions with Morse index $i(W_n)=n$.
  We show that the complex time extensions $\Gamma(r+\mathrm{i}s)$, of analytic real heteroclinic orbits towards $W_0=-\sqrt{\lambda/6}$, are not complex entire. For example, consider the time-reversible complex-valued solution $\psi(s)$ of the nonlinear and nonconservative quadratic Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation*} \label{**} \mathrm{i}\psi_s=\psi_{xx}+6\psi^2-\lambda \tag{**} \end{equation*} with real initial condition $\psi_0=\Gamma(r_0)$. Then there exist $r_0$ such that $\psi(s)$ blows up at some finite real times $\pm s^*$.
  Abstractly, our results are formulated in the setting of analytic semigroups. They are based on Poincar\'e non-resonance of unstable eigenvalues at equilibria $W_n$, near pitchfork bifurcation. Technically, we have to except a discrete set of $\lambda&gt;0$, and are currently limited to unstable dimensions $n\leq22$, or to fast unstable manifolds of dimensions $d&lt;1+\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}n$.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates on the size of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to uniform-in-time concentration estimates and to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Asymptotic Behavior of Large Strong Solutions to the 3D Full Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Density-dependent Viscosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to investigate the Cauchy problem of global-in-time existence of large strong solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations for compressible viscous and heat conducting fluids. A class of density-dependent viscosity is considered. By introducing the modified effective viscous flux and using the bootstrap argument, we establish the global existence of large strong solution when the initial density is linearly equivalent to a large constant state. It is worthy of mentioning that, different from the work of Matsumura and Nishida (J. Math. Kyoto Univ., 1980) with small initial perturbation and the work of Huang and Li (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2018) with small energy but possibly large oscillations, our global large strong solution is uniform-in-time in $H^2$ Sobolev space and the uniform-in-time bounds of both density and temperature are obtained without any restrictions on the size of initial velocity and initial temperature. In addition, when the initial data belongs to $L^{p_0}\cap H^2$ with $p_0\in[1,2]$, we establish the convergence of the solution to its associated equilibrium with an explicit decay rate whether the initial data close to or far away from the equilibrium in the whole space. As a result, we give a specific large strong solution in Sobolev space satisfying the global existence assumptions proposed by Villani (Mem. Amer. Math. Soc., 2009), He, Huang, and Wang (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2019), Zhang and Zi (Ann. Inst. H. Poincare Anal. Non Lineaire, 2020) in studying the asymptotic behavior of solution, and extend the second above result to the nonisentropic case. This paper considers for the first time the application of Fourier splitting method to Navier-Stokes equations with variable viscosity.</description>

      <title>A blow up solution of the Navier-Stokes equations with a critical force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A forced solution $v$ of the Navier-Stokes equation in any open domain with no slip boundary condition is constructed. The scaling factor of the forcing term is the critical order $-2$. The velocity, which is smooth until its final blow up moment, is in the energy space through out. Since most physical forces from a point source in nature are regarded as order $-2$, such as Coulomb force, Yukawa force, this result indicates possible singularity formation under these kind of forces. The result also holds for some log subcritical forces or some forces in the standard critical space $L^\infty_t L^{3/2}_x$, including the explicit force: $F=- \delta \frac{e^{-|x|^2}}{(|x|^2 + T-t) \,[1+ | \ln (|x|^2 + T-t)|]} (1, 0, 0) $ for any small $\delta&gt;0$..</description>

Abstract: We show a priori bounds for the dynamic fractional $\Phi^4$ model on $\mathbb{T}^3$ in the full subcritical regime using the framework of Hairer's regularity structures theory. Assuming the model bounds our estimates imply global existence of solutions and existence of an invariant measure. We extend the method developed for the usual heat operator by Chandra, Moinat and Weber [CMW23] to the fractional heat operator, thereby treating a more physically relevant model. A key ingredient in this work is the development of localised multilevel Schauder estimates for the fractional heat operator which is not covered by Hairer's original work. Furthermore, the algebraic arguments from [CMW23] are streamlined significantly.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present mathematical analysis of one-dimensional effective models proposed in [\cite{MunozDelgado}] concerning Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of harmonic confinement. Among the demonstrated properties, we can mention: existence, uniqueness, orbital stability, symmetry and gaussian asymptotic decay of ground-state solutions in the repulsive case. We also report formul\ae\ for the minimal energy $E_{\mn}$ and the associate chemical potential $\mu$ as functions of a parameter $\lambda$, which is related to $N$ (the number of atoms) and/or $a$ (the s-wave scattering length). By considering Taylor's development of the non-quadratic therm of the energy and using appropriate gaussian functions as approximations for the ground state, we present some numerical experiments to illustrate our results.</description>

Abstract: We study a generalization of the manifold-valued Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model, which involves an initial datum $f$ mapping from a curved compact surface with smooth boundary to a complete, connected and smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of minimizers under curvature restrictions on the target and topological ones on the range of $f$. We obtain a series of regularity results on the associated PDE system of a relaxed functional with Neumann boundary condition. We apply these results to the ROF model to obtain Lipschitz regularity of minimizers without further requirements on the convexity of the boundary. Additionally, we provide variants of the regularity statement of independent interest: for 1-dimensional domains (related to signal denoising), local Lipschitz regularity (meaningful for image processing) and Lipschitz regularity for a version of the Mosolov problem coming from fluid mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We establish the Alexandroff-Bakelman-Pucci estimate, the Harnack inequality, the H\"older regularity and the Schauder estimates to a class of degenerate parabolic equations of non-divergence form in all dimensions \begin{equation} \mathcal{L}u:= u_t -Lu= u_t -(x a_{11} u_{xx} +2\sqrt{x} \sum_{j=2}^n a_{1j} u_{x y_j} + \sum_{i,j=2}^n a_{ij} u_{y_i y_j} + b_1 u_x +\sum_{j=2}^n b_j u_{y_j} ) =g\ \end{equation} on \(x \geq 0, y=(y_2,\ldots, y_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}\), with bounded measurable coefficients.</description>
