      <title>Designing robust trajectories by lobe dynamics in low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern space missions with uncrewed spacecraft require robust trajectory design to connect multiple chaotic orbits by small controls. To address this issue, we propose a novel control scheme to design robust trajectories by leveraging a geometrical structure in chaotic zones, known as {\it lobe}. Our scheme shows that appropriately selected lobes reveal possible paths to traverse chaotic zones in a short time. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through trajectory design in both the standard map and Hill's equation.</description>

      <title>If our chaotic operator is derived correctly, then the Riemann hypothesis holds true</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore novel chaotic dynamics derived from the Riemann and von Mangoldt function formula regarding the distribution of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. By computing Lyapunov exponents, we demonstrate that the derived dynamics exhibit chaotic behavior when the gaps between zeros are within a certain bound, specifically up to 2.4. Beyond this threshold, the dynamics do not display chaotic behavior. Furthermore, we derive a chaotic operator for the Riemann zeta function within the critical strip, utilizing the correction term from the Riemann-von Mangoldt formula. We establish the chaotic nature and Hermiticity of this operator, and discuss its diagonalization properties. Moreover, our study reveals a remarkable compatibility between our derived chaotic operator and the quantum hydrogen model, as evidenced by the analysis of its eigenvalues resembling the energy levels of hydrogen. Numerical evidence, including Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation analysis, and entropy computation, underscores the unpredictability of the system. Additionally, we establish a connection between our chaotic operator and the prime number theorem regarding the density of primes. Furthermore, our investigation suggests that this chaotic operator strongly supports the validity of the Riemann hypothesis, as proposed by Hilbert and Polya. These findings shed light on the intricate relationship between chaotic dynamics, number theory, and quantum mechanics, offering new perspectives on the behavior of the Riemann zeta function and its zeros. Finally, we demonstrate the Hermiticity and diagonalization properties of our operator using the spectral theorem, further elucidating its mathematical properties and unboundedness.</description>

      <title>Causal dependencies and Shannon entropy budget -- Analysis of a reduced order atmospheric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The information entropy budget and the rate of information transfer between variables is studied in the context of a nonlinear reduced-order atmospheric model. The key ingredients of the dynamics are present in this model, namely the baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, the instability related to the presence of an orography, the dissipation related to the surface friction, and the large-scale meridional imbalance of energy. For the parameter chosen, the solutions of this system display a chaotic dynamics reminiscent of the large-scale atmospheric dynamics in the extra-tropics. The detailed information entropy budget analysis of this system reveals that the linear rotation terms plays a minor role in the generation of uncertainties as compared to the orography and the surface friction. Additionally, the dominant contribution comes from the nonlinear advection terms, and their decomposition in synergetic (co-variability) and single (impact of each single variable on the target one) components reveals that for some variables the co-variability dominates the information transfer. The estimation of the rate of information transfer based on time series is also discussed, and an extension of the Liang's approach to nonlinear observables, is proposed.</description>

      <title>Parisi's hypercube, Fock-space frustration and near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of Parisi where a single particle hops on an infinite-dimensional hypercube, under the influence of a uniform but disordered magnetic flux. We reinterpret the hypercube as the Fock-space graph of a many-body Hamiltonian and the flux as a frustration of the return amplitudes in Fock space. We will identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DS-SYK) model, and hence the hypercube model is an equally good quantum model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_{1}$ (NAdS$_2$/NCFT$_1$) holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube Hamiltonian is not $p$ local. Instead, the SYK model can be understood as a Fock-space model with similar frustrations. Hence we propose this type of Fock-space frustration as the broader characterization for NAdS$_2$/NCFT$_1$ microscopics, which encompasses the hypercube and the DS-SYK models as two specific examples. We then speculate on the possible origin of such frustrations.</description>
