      <title>Seamless Graph Task Scheduling over Dynamic Vehicular Clouds: A Hybrid Methodology for Integrating Pilot and Instantaneous Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular clouds (VCs) play a crucial role in the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem by securing essential computing resources for a wide range of tasks. This paPertackles the intricacies of resource provisioning in dynamic VCs for computation-intensive tasks, represented by undirected graphs for parallel processing over multiple vehicles. We model the dynamics of VCs by considering multiple factors, including varying communication quality among vehicles, fluctuating computing capabilities of vehicles, uncertain contact duration among vehicles, and dynamic data exchange costs between vehicles. Our primary goal is to obtain feasible assignments between task components and nearby vehicles, called templates, in a timely manner with minimized task completion time and data exchange overhead. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid graph task scheduling (P-HTS) methodology that combines offline and online decision-making modes. For the offline mode, we introduce an approach called risk-aware pilot isomorphic subgraph searching (RA-PilotISS), which predicts feasible solutions for task scheduling in advance based on historical information. Then, for the online mode, we propose time-efficient instantaneous isomorphic subgraph searching (TE-InstaISS), serving as a backup approach for quickly identifying new optimal scheduling template when the one identified by RA-PilotISS becomes invalid due to changing conditions. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed hybrid mechanism compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of various evaluative metrics, e.g., time efficiency such as the delay caused by seeking for possible templates and task completion time, as well as cost function, upon considering different VC scales and graph task topologies.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation in Optical Networks: Hype or Hope?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamic resource allocation in optical networks has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, with almost 100 peer-reviewed papers. We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19--36\% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples. We make our simulation framework and results publicly available to promote reproducible research and standardized evaluation https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12594495.</description>

      <title>NTP-INT: Network Traffic Prediction-Driven In-band Network Telemetry for High-load Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-band network telemetry (INT) is essential to network management due to its real-time visibility. However, because of the rapid increase in network devices and services, it has become crucial to have targeted access to detailed network information in a dynamic network environment. This paper proposes an intelligent network telemetry system called NTP-INT to obtain more fine-grained network information on high-load switches. Specifically, NTP-INT consists of three modules: network traffic prediction module, network pruning module, and probe path planning module. Firstly, the network traffic prediction module adopts a Multi-Temporal Graph Neural Network (MTGNN) to predict future network traffic and identify high-load switches. Then, we design the network pruning algorithm to generate a subnetwork covering all high-load switches to reduce the complexity of probe path planning. Finally, the probe path planning module uses an attention-mechanism-based deep reinforcement learning (DEL) model to plan efficient probe paths in the network slice. The experimental results demonstrate that NTP-INT can acquire more precise network information on high-load switches while decreasing the control overhead by 50\%.</description>

      <title>A Survey on DRL based UAV Communications and Networking: DRL Fundamentals, Applications and Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are playing an increasingly pivotal role in modern communication networks,offering flexibility and enhanced coverage for a variety of applica-tions. However, UAV networks pose significant challenges due to their dynamic and distributed nature, particularly when dealing with tasks such as power allocation, channel assignment, caching,and task offloading. Traditional optimization techniques often struggle to handle the complexity and unpredictability of these environments, leading to suboptimal performance. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of how deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be applied to solve these mathematical optimization problems in UAV communications and networking.Rather than simply introducing DRL methods, the focus is on demonstrating how these methods can be utilized to solve complex mathematical models of the underlying problems. We begin by reviewing the fundamental concepts of DRL, including value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic approaches. Then,we illustrate how DRL algorithms are applied to specific UAV network tasks by discussing from problem formulations to DRL implementation. By framing UAV communication challenges as optimization problems, this survey emphasizes the practical value of DRL in dynamic and uncertain environments. We also explore the strengths of DRL in handling large-scale network scenarios and the ability to continuously adapt to changes in the environment. In addition, future research directions are outlined, highlighting the potential for DRL to further enhance UAV communications and expand its applicability to more complex,multi-agent settings.</description>

      <title>5G Integrated Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance: A Vision and Future Research Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) is the backbone of the Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) systems, ensuring safe and efficient operations of modern and future aviation. Traditionally, the CNS is considered three independent systems: communications, navigation, and surveillance. The current CNS system is fragmented, with limited integration across its three domains. Integrated CNS (ICNS) is a contemporary concept implying that those systems are provisioned through the same technology stack. ICNS is envisioned to improve service quality, spectrum efficiency, communication capacity, navigation predictability, and surveillance capabilities. The 5G technology stack offers higher throughput, lower latency, and massive connectivity compared to many existing communication technologies. This paper presents our 5G ICNS vision and network architecture and discusses how 5G technology can support integrated CNS services using terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. We also discuss key 5G radio access technologies for delivering integrated CNS services at low altitudes for Innovative Air Mobility (IAM) and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations. Finally, we present relevant challenges and potential research directions for further studies.</description>

      <title>Semantica: Decentralized Search using a LLM-Guided Semantic Tree Overlay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centralized search engines are key for the Internet, but lead to undesirable concentration of power. Decentralized alternatives fail to offer equal document retrieval accuracy and speed. Nevertheless, Semantic Overlay Networks can come close to the performance of centralized solutions when the semantics of documents are properly captured. This work uses embeddings from Large Language Models to capture semantics and fulfill the promise of Semantic Overlay Networks. Our proposed algorithm, called Semantica, constructs a prefix tree (trie) utilizing document embeddings calculated by a language model. Users connect to each other based on the embeddings of their documents, ensuring that semantically similar users are directly linked. Thereby, this construction makes it more likely for user searches to be answered by the users that they are directly connected to, or by the users they are close to in the network connection graph. The implementation of our algorithm also accommodates the semantic diversity of individual users by spawning "clone" user identifiers in the tree. Our experiments use emulation with a real-world workload to show Semantica's ability to identify and connect to similar users quickly. Semantica finds up to ten times more semantically similar users than current state-of-the-art approaches. At the same time, Semantica can retrieve more than two times the number of relevant documents given the same network load. We also make our code publicly available to facilitate further research in the area.</description>

      <title>KiSS: A Novel Container Size-Aware Memory Management Policy for Serverless in Edge-Cloud Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serverless computing has revolutionized cloud architectures by enabling developers to deploy event-driven applications via lightweight, self-contained virtualized containers. However, serverless frameworks face critical cold-start challenges in resource-constrained edge environments, where traditional solutions fall short. The limitations are especially pronounced in edge environments, where heterogeneity and resource constraints exacerbate inefficiencies in resource utilization.
  This paper introduces KiSS (Keep it Separated Serverless), a static, container size-aware memory management policy tailored for the edge-cloud continuum. The design of KiSS is informed by a detailed workload analysis that identifies critical patterns in container size, invocation frequency, and memory contention. Guided by these insights, KiSS partitions memory pools into categories for small, frequently invoked containers and larger, resource-intensive ones, ensuring efficient resource utilization while minimizing cold starts and inter-function interference. Using a discrete-event simulator, we evaluate KiSS on edge-cluster environments with real-world-inspired workloads.
  Results show that KiSS reduces cold-start percentages by 60% and function drops by 56.5%, achieving significant performance gains in resource-constrained settings. This work underscores the importance of workload-driven design in advancing serverless efficiency at the edge.</description>

      <title>Universal Embedding Function for Traffic Classification via QUIC Domain Recognition Pretraining: A Transfer Learning Success</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification (TC) methods must adapt to new protocols and extensions as well as to advancements in other machine learning fields. In this paper, we follow a transfer learning setup best known from computer vision. We first pretrain an embedding model on a complex task with a large number of classes and then transfer it to five well-known TC datasets. The pretraining task is recognition of SNI domains in encrypted QUIC traffic, which in itself is a problem for network monitoring due to the growing adoption of TLS Encrypted Client Hello. Our training pipeline -- featuring a disjoint class setup, ArcFace loss function, and a modern deep learning architecture -- aims to produce universal embeddings applicable across tasks. The proposed solution, based on nearest neighbors search in the embedding space, surpasses SOTA performance on four of the five TC datasets. A comparison with a baseline method utilizing raw packet sequences revealed unexpected findings with potential implications for the broader TC field. We published the model architecture, trained weights, and transfer learning experiments.</description>

      <title>Region-based Content Enhancement for Efficient Video Analytics at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video analytics is widespread in various applications serving our society. Recent advances of content enhancement in video analytics offer significant benefits for the bandwidth saving and accuracy improvement. However, existing content-enhanced video analytics systems are excessively computationally expensive and provide extremely low throughput. In this paper, we present region-based content enhancement, that enhances only the important regions in videos, to improve analytical accuracy. Our system, RegenHance, enables high-accuracy and high-throughput video analytics at the edge by 1) a macroblock-based region importance predictor that identifies the important regions fast and precisely, 2) a region-aware enhancer that stitches sparsely distributed regions into dense tensors and enhances them efficiently, and 3) a profile-based execution planer that allocates appropriate resources for enhancement and analytics components. We prototype RegenHance on five heterogeneous edge devices. Experiments on two analytical tasks reveal that region-based enhancement improves the overall accuracy of 10-19% and achieves 2-3x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art frame-based enhancement methods.</description>

      <title>Value-based Proactive Caching for Sensing Data in Vehicular Networks: An Operator's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Access to sensing data (SD) is crucial for vehicular networks to ensure safe and efficient transportation services. Given the vast volume of data involved, proactive caching required SD is a pivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data accessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD caching within a single slot. Therefore, these approaches lack scalability for scenarios involving multi-slots and are not well-suited for network operators who manage resources within a long-term cost budget. Moreover, the oversight of service capacity at caching nodes may result in substantial queuing delays for SD reception. To tackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring SD caching and allocating from an operator's perspective. A value model incorporating both temporal and spacial characteristics is given to estimate the significance of various caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic programming model is proposed to optimize the long-term system performance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary variables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm optimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical investigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with other schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit ratio.</description>

      <title>Large Generative AI Models meet Open Networks for 6G: Integration, Platform, and Monetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has emerged as a pivotal technology for content generation, reasoning, and decision-making, making it a promising solution on the 6G stage characterized by openness, connected intelligence, and service democratization. This article explores strategies for integrating and monetizing GAI within future open 6G networks, mainly from the perspectives of mobile network operators (MNOs). We propose a novel API-centric telecoms GAI marketplace platform, designed to serve as a central hub for deploying, managing, and monetizing diverse GAI services directly within the network. This platform underpins a flexible and interoperable ecosystem, enhances service delivery, and facilitates seamless integration of GAI capabilities across various network segments, thereby enabling new revenue streams through customer-centric generative services. Results from experimental evaluation in an end-to-end Open RAN testbed, show the latency benefits of this platform for local large language model (LLM) deployment, by comparing token timing for various generated lengths with cloud-based general-purpose LLMs. Lastly, the article discusses key considerations for implementing the GAI marketplace within 6G networks, including monetization strategy, regulatory, management, and service platform aspects.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Echo Chamber Research: Comparative Analysis of Conceptualizations, Operationalizations, and Varying Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This systematic review synthesizes research on echo chambers and filter bubbles to explore the reasons behind dissent regarding their existence, antecedents, and effects. It provides a taxonomy of conceptualizations and operationalizations, analyzing how measurement approaches and contextual factors influence outcomes.
  The review of 129 studies identifies variations in measurement approaches, as well as regional, political, cultural, and platform-specific biases, as key factors contributing to the lack of consensus. Studies based on homophily and computational social science methods often support the echo chamber hypothesis, while research on content exposure and broader media environments, such as surveys, tends to challenge it. Group behavior, cultural influences, instant messaging platforms, and short video platforms remain underexplored. The strong geographic focus on the United States further highlights the need for studies in multi-party systems and regions beyond the Global North.
  Future research should prioritize cross-platform studies, continuous algorithmic audits, and investigations into the causal links between polarization, fragmentation, and echo chambers to advance the field. This review also provides recommendations for using the EUs Digital Services Act to enhance research in this area and conduct studies outside the US in multi-party systems. By addressing these gaps, this review contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of echo chambers, their measurement, and their societal impacts.</description>

      <title>An Attentive Graph Agent for Topology-Adaptive Cyber Defence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent and adaptive cyber defense systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information and constraining their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment, encoding network state as a directed graph with realistic low-level features. We employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and adapt its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in RL. Our GAT-based approach offers key advantages over flattened alternatives: policies that demonstrate resilience to certain types of unexpected dynamic network topology changes, reasonable generalisation to networks of varying sizes within the same structural distribution, and interpretable defensive actions grounded in tangible network properties. We demonstrate that GAT defensive policies can be trained using our low-level directed graph observations, even when unexpected connections arise during simulation. Evaluations across networks of different sizes, but consistent subnetwork structure, show our policies achieve comparable performance to policies trained specifically for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</description>

Abstract: Future wireless networks must support emerging applications where environmental awareness is as critical as data transmission. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) enables this vision by allowing base stations (BSs) to allocate bandwidth and power to mobile users (MUs) for communications and cooperative sensing. However, this resource allocation is highly challenging due to: (i) dynamic resource demands from MUs and resource supply from BSs, and (ii) the selfishness of MUs and BSs. To address these challenges, existing solutions rely on either real-time (online) resource trading, which incurs high overhead and failures, or static long-term (offline) resource contracts, which lack flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Future Resource Bank for ISAC, a hybrid trading framework that integrates offline and online resource allocation through a level-wise client model, where MUs and their coalitions negotiate with BSs. We introduce two mechanisms: (i) Role-Friendly Win-Win Matching (offRFW$^2$M), leveraging overbooking to establish risk-aware, stable contracts, and (ii) Effective Backup Win-Win Matching (onEBW$^2$M), which dynamically reallocates unmet demand and surplus supply. We theoretically prove stability, individual rationality, and weak Pareto optimality of these mechanisms. Through simulations, we show that our framework improves social welfare, latency, and energy efficiency compared to existing methods.</description>
