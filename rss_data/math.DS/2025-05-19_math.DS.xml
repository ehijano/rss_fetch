      <title>Heteroclinic Connection in a Nicholson's delayed model with Harvesting term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of monotone heteroclinic solutions for the delayed Nicholson's blowflies model with harvesting:
  \[
  x'(t) = -\delta x(t) - Hx(t-\sigma) + \rho x(t-r)e^{-x(t-r)}.
  \]
  Under the condition $1 &lt; \dfrac{\rho}{\delta+H} \leq e$, we establish the connection between the equilibria $0$ and $\ln(\rho/(\delta+H))$ using the Wu and Zou monotone iteration method adapted for two delays ($\sigma \neq r$). The proof combines explicit upper and lower solutions construction with characteristic equation analysis, supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the Ehrhard-M\"uller system with invariant algebraic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the global dynamics of the Ehrhard-M\"uller differential system \[ \dot{x} = s(y - x), \quad \dot{y} = rx - xz - y + c, \quad \dot{z} = xy - z, \] where $s$, $r$ and $c$ are real parameters, and $x$, $y$, and $z$ are real variables. We classify the invariant algebraic surfaces of degree $2$ of this differential system. After we describe the phase portraits in the Poincar\'e ball of this differential system having one of this invariant algebraic surfaces.
  The Poincar\'e ball is the closed unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose interior has been identified with $\mathbb{R}^3$, and his boundary, the $2$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, has been identified with the infinity of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Note that in the space $\mathbb{R}^3$ we can go to infinity in as many as directions as points has the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. A polynomial differential system as the Ehrhard-M\"uller system can be extended analytically to the Poincar\'e ball, in this way we can study its dynamics in a neigborhood of infinity. Providing these phase portraits in the Poincar\'e ball we are describing the dynamics of all orbits of the Ehrhard-M\"uller system having an invariant algebraic surface of degree $2$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic homeostasis in relaxation and bursting oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homeostasis, broadly speaking, refers to the maintenance of a stable internal state when faced with external stimuli. Failure to manage these regulatory processes can lead to different diseases or death. Most physiologists and cell biologists around the world agree that homeostasis is a fundamental tenet of their disciplines. Nevertheless, a precise definition of homeostasis is hard to come by. Often times, homeostasis is simply defined as ``you know it when you see it''. Mathematical treatments of homeostasis involve studying equilibria of dynamical systems that are relatively invariant with respect to parameters. However, physiological processes are rarely static and often involve dynamic processes such as oscillations. In such dynamic environments, quantities such as average values may be relatively invariant with respect to parameters. This has been referred to as ``homeodynamics''. We present a general framework for homeodynamics involving systems with two or more time scales that elicits homeostasis in the temporal average of a species. The key point is that homeostasis manifests when measuring the slow variable responsible for driving oscillations and is not apparent in the fast variables. We demonstrate this in the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model for relaxation oscillations and then in two models for electrical bursting activity and calcium oscillations in pancreatic $\beta$-cells. One of these models has multiple slow variables, each driving the bursting oscillations in different parameter regimes, but homeodynamics is only present in the variable currently engaged in this role.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Error-free Retrieval in Kuramoto-type Associative-memory Networks via Two-memory Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the associative-memory network of Kuramoto-type oscillators that stores a set of memorized patterns (memories). In [Phys. Rev. Lett., 92 (2004), 108101], Nishikawa, Lai and Hoppensteadt showed that the capacity of this system for pattern retrieval with small errors can be made as high as that of the Hopfield network. Some stability analysis efforts focus on mutually orthogonal memories; however, the theoretical results do not ensure error-free retrieval in general situations. In this paper, we present a route for using the model in pattern retrieval problems with small or large errors. We employ the eigenspectrum analysis of Jacobians and potential analysis of the gradient flow to derive the stability/instability of binary patterns. For two memories, the eigenspectrum of Jacobian at each pattern can be specified, which enables us to give the critical value of the parameter to distinguish the memories from all other patterns in stability. This setting of two memories substantially reduces the number of stable patterns and enlarges their basins, allowing us to recover defective patterns. We extend this approach to general cases and present a deterministic method for ensuring error-free retrieval across a general set of standard patterns. Numerical simulations and comparative analyses illustrate the approach.</description>

      <title>Backward bifurcations and multistationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of backward bifurcations provides a criterion for the existence of positive steady states in epidemiological models with parameters where the basic reproductive ratio is less than one. It is often seen in simulations that this phenomenon is accompanied by multistationarity, i.e. the existence of more than one positive steady state, but the latter circumstance is not implied by the general theory. The central result of this paper is a theorem which gives a criterion for the existence of one stable and one unstable positive steady state for parameters where the basic reproductive ratio is less than one. It also gives a criterion for the existence of one stable and one unstable positive steady state in the case that the basic reproductive ratio is greater than one. These steady states arise in a bifurcation. It is shown that in one case, a model for the in-host dynamics of hepatitis C, this result can be used as a basis for showing the existence of parameters for which there are two positive steady states, one of which is stable. Thus, in particular, multistationarity is proved in that case. It is also shown to what extent this theorem can be applied to some other models which have been studied in the literature and what new results can be obtained. In that context the new approach is compared with those previously known.</description>

      <title>Heterodimensional cycles derived from homoclinic tangencies via Hopf bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze three-dimensional $C^{r}$ diffeomorphisms ($r\ge 5$) exhibiting a quadratic focus-saddle homoclinic tangency whose multipliers satisfy $|\lambda\gamma| = 1$. For a proper three-parameter unfolding that splits the tangency, varies the argument of the stable multipliers, and controls the modulus $|\lambda\gamma|$, we show that a Hopf bifurcation occurs on this curve and that a homoclinic point to the bifurcating periodic orbit is present. As a consequence, the original map $f$ can be $C^{r}$-approximated by a diffeomorphism exhibiting a coindex-one heterodimensional cycle in the saddle case.</description>

      <title>When do Lyapunov Subcenter Manifolds become Eigenmanifolds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-body mechanical systems have rich internal dynamics, which can be exploited to formulate efficient control targets. For periodic regulation tasks in robotics applications, this motivated the extension of the theory on nonlinear normal modes to Riemannian manifolds, and led to the definition of Eigenmanifolds. This definition is geometric, which is advantageous for generality within robotics but also obscures the connection of Eigenmanifolds to a large body of results from the literature on nonlinear dynamics. We bridge this gap, showing that Eigenmanifolds are instances of Lyapunov subcenter manifolds (LSMs), and that their stronger geometric properties with respect to LSMs follow from a time-symmetry of conservative mechanical systems. This directly leads to local existence and uniqueness results for Eigenmanifolds. Furthermore, we show that an additional spatial symmetry provides Eigenmanifolds with yet stronger properties of Rosenberg manifolds, which can be favorable for control applications, and we present a sufficient condition for their existence and uniqueness. These theoretical results are numerically confirmed on two mechanical systems with a non-constant inertia tensor: a double pendulum and a 5-link pendulum.</description>

      <title>Singularity of the spectrum of typical minimal smooth area-preserving flows in any genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider smooth flows preserving a smooth invariant measure, or, equivalently, locally Hamiltonian flows on compact orientable surfaces and show that almost every such locally Hamiltonian flow with only simple saddles has singular spectrum. Furthermore, we prove that almost every pair of such flows is spectrally disjoint. More in general, singularity of the spectrum and pairwise disjointness holds for special flows over a full measure set of interval exchange transformations under a roof with symmetric logarithmic singularities. The spectral result is proved using a criterion for singularity based on tightness of Birkhoff sums with exponential tails decay and the cancellations proved by the last author to prove absence of mixing in this class of flows, by showing that the latter can be combined with rigidity. Disjointness of pairs then follows by producing mixing times (for the second flow), using a new mechanism for shearing based on resonant rigidity times.</description>

      <title>Regularity and Stability Properties of Selective SSMs with Discontinuous Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Selective State-Space Models (SSMs), characterized by input-dependent, time-varying parameters, offer significant expressive power but pose challenges for stability analysis, especially with discontinuous gating signals. In this paper, we investigate the stability and regularity properties of continuous-time selective SSMs through the lens of passivity and Input-to-State Stability (ISS). We establish that intrinsic energy dissipation guarantees exponential forgetting of past states. Crucially, we prove that the unforced system dynamics possess an underlying minimal quadratic energy function whose defining matrix exhibits robust $\text{AUC}_{\text{loc}}$ regularity, accommodating discontinuous gating. Furthermore, assuming a universal quadratic storage function ensures passivity across all inputs, we derive parametric LMI conditions and kernel constraints that limit gating mechanisms, formalizing "irreversible forgetting" of recurrent models. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions for global ISS, linking uniform local dissipativity to overall system robustness. Our findings offer a rigorous framework for understanding and designing stable and reliable deep selective SSMs.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for Hausdorff and packing dimensions of fractal percolation on self-affine sponges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish variational principles for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a class of statistically self-affine sponges, including in particular fractal percolation sets obtained from Bara\'nski and Gatzouras-Lalley carpets and sponges. Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpi\'nski sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miyanishi conjecture claims that for any variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, any endomorphism of such a variety which is injective outside a closed subset of codimension at least $2$ is bijective. We prove Miyanishi conjecture for any quasi-projective variety $X$ which is a dense open subset of a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial normal projective variety $\overline{X}$ such that codim $(\overline{X} \setminus X) \ge 2$ with the ample canonical divisor or the ample anti-canonical divisor. Also, we observe Miyanishi conjecture without the conditions of its canonical divisor by using minimal model program. In particular, we prove Miyanishi conjecture in the case that $\overline{X}$ has canonical singularities and $\overline{X}$ has the canonical model which is obtained by divisorial contractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear time-invariant quadratic output (LTIQO) systems generalize linear time-invariant systems to nonlinear regimes. Problems of this class occur in multiple applications naturally, such as port-Hamiltonian systems, optimal control, and stochastical problems. We introduce an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm for LTIQO systems with one or multiple outputs and propose an algorithm to optimize a reduced order model (ROM) to be close in the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm to a given full order model. We illustrate the applicability and the performance with an established numerical example and compare the resulting ROMs with results from balanced truncation and $\mathcal{H}_2$-focussed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A geometric interpretation of the equinoctial elements is given with a connection to orthogonal rotations and attitude dynamics in Euclidean 3-space. An identification is made between the equinoctial elements and classic Rodrigues parameters. A new set of equinoctial elements are developed using the modified Rodrigues parameters, thereby removing the coordinate singularity for retrograde equatorial orbits present in previous versions of these elements. A low-thrust trajectory optimization problem is set up using the new elements to numerically verify convergence for the two-point boundary problem, as compared to their predecessors.</description>

      <title>Augmented Regression Models using Neurochaos Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents novel Augmented Regression Models using Neurochaos Learning (NL), where Tracemean features derived from the Neurochaos Learning framework are integrated with traditional regression algorithms : Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Our approach was evaluated using ten diverse real-life datasets and a synthetically generated dataset of the form $y = mx + c + \epsilon$. Results show that incorporating the Tracemean feature (mean of the chaotic neural traces of the neurons in the NL architecture) significantly enhances regression performance, particularly in Augmented Lasso Regression and Augmented SVR, where six out of ten real-life datasets exhibited improved predictive accuracy. Among the models, Augmented Chaotic Ridge Regression achieved the highest average performance boost (11.35 %). Additionally, experiments on the simulated dataset demonstrated that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the augmented models consistently decreased and converged towards the Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) as the sample size increased. This work demonstrates the potential of chaos-inspired features in regression tasks, offering a pathway to more accurate and computationally efficient prediction models.</description>

      <title>True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</description>

      <title>Counting Totally real units and eigenvalue patterns in $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ and $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$ along thin tubes</title>

Abstract: Fix a vector $(v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n)$ with $v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n$ and $\sum v_i=0$, and let $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$ be the $\varepsilon$-ball around $Tv$ for $T&gt;1$. As $T\to\infty$, (1) the number of degree-$n$ totally real units whose logarithmic embeddings lie in $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$, and (2) the number of eigenvalue patterns of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ whose logarithmic embeddings lie in $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$, both grow like $$\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)\,T\right)$$ where $ \rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(n-i)\,v_i$ is the half-sum of positive roots of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$. Hence the two arithmetic problems share the same \emph{directional entropy}. Because each eigenvalue pattern determines an $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$-conjugacy class, this yields a lower bound of order $\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)T\right)$ for the number of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$-conjugacy classes with a prescribed eigenvalue pattern; we also obtain an upper bound of order $\exp \left(2\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)T\right)$. A parallel argument for the symplectic lattice $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$ and $v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n,-v_n,\dots ,-v_1), v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n&gt;0,$ gives growth $\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{Sp}_{2n}}(v)T\right)$ with $\rho_{\rm{Sp}_{2n}}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^n(n+1-i)v_i$, the half-sum of positive roots of $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb R)$.</description>

Abstract: We study Anosov families which are sequences of diffeomorphisms along compact Riemannian manifolds such that the tangent bundle split into expanding and contracting subspaces. In this paper we prove that a certain class of Anosov families: (i) admit canonical coordinates (ii) are expansive, (iii) satisfy the shadowing property, and (iv) exhibit a Markov partition.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Hepatitis B Virus Infection Dynamics through an Intracellular Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of the cell population generally provides average information about viral infection in
  a host whereas the intracellular model captures the individual cellular responses. The primary
  goal of this study is to comprehensively analyze the intracellular dynamics of hepatitis B virus
  (HBV) infection and to identify the most influential factors. In this study, an intracellular
  HBV infection dynamics model is proposed by considering several intracellular steps that are
  observed in the virus life cycle. Upon comparison with the experimental data, it is seen that the
  model solutions exhibit a good agreement. The well-known fourth-order Runge-Kutta method
  is applied to numerically solve the proposed model. The effects of HBx proteins, dslDNA containing intermediates, intracellular delay and initial concentration of cccDNAs are explicitly
  studied. In order to identify the most positively and also the most negatively sensitive parameter
  of the proposed model, the global sensitivity analysis is performed using the widely-used method,
  Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficients. As a result, it is observed that
  HBx proteins have notable impacts on the dynamics of the infection, whereas intracellular delay
  and dslDNA-containing intermediates may not significantly affect the infection. This study also
  suggests that sub-viral particles could potentially contribute to the progression of the infection.
  Furthermore, recycling of capsids (an intracellular process perhaps unique to the HBV life cycle,
  where a portion of the newly produced capsids return to the nucleus and amplify the cccDNAs)
  is found to play an important role in enhancing the infection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A smooth conservative DA-diffeomorphism is smoothly conjugated to its Anosov linear part if and only if all Lyapunov exponents coincide almost everywhere with those of its linear part. A more general result for entropy maximizing measures of $C^{1+\alpha}$ partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms isotopic to Anosov (DA-diffeomorphisms) on $T^3$ is that they are SRB measures if and only if the sum of its positive Lyapunov exponents coincides with that of the linear Anosov map on all periodic orbits of the support of the measure. In that case, the measure is also the unique physical measure. This rigidity result is not as strong as in the A. Katok rigidity conjecture. Examples are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive systems are characterized by their inability to generate energy internally, providing a powerful tool for modeling physical phenomena. Additionally, algebraically encoding passivity in the system description can be advantageous. For this, port-Hamiltonian systems are a prominent approach. Another possibility is writing the system in suitable coordinates. In this paper, we investigate the equivalence between passivity and the feasibility of passivity encoding representations, thereby elaborating upon existing results for port-Hamiltonian systems. Based on our findings, we present a method to construct port-Hamiltonian representations of a passive system if the dynamics and the Hamiltonian are known.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the smoothness of the density function of absolutely continuous measures supported on random self-similar sets on the line. We show that the natural projection of a measure with symbolic local dimension greater than 1 at every point is absolutely continuous with H\"older continuous density almost surely. In particular, if the similarity dimension is greater than 1 then the random self-similar set on the line contains an interior point almost surely.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the large scale chaotic, topological structure of the trajectories of an infinite sequence of dispersing, hence ergodic, $2D$ billiards with the configuration space $Q_n=\mathbb{T}^2 \setminus \bigcup_{i=0}^{n-1} D_i$, where the scatterers $D_i$ ($i=0,1,\dots,n-1$) are disks of radius $r&lt;&lt;1$ centered at the points $(i/n, 0)$ mod $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We get effective lower and upper radial bounds for the rotation set $R$. Furthermore, we also prove the compactness of the admissible rotation set $AR$ and the fact that the rotation vectors $v$ corresponding to admissible periodic orbits form a dense subset of $AR$. We also obtain asymptotic lower and upper estimates for the sequence $h_{top}(n)$ of topological entropies and precise asymptotic formulas for the metric entropies $h_{\mu}(n,r)$.</description>

Abstract: An analytic classification of generic anti-polynomial vector fields $\dot z = \overline{P(z)}$ is given in term of a topological and an analytic invariants. The number of generic strata in the parameter space is counted for each degree of $P$. A Realization Theorem is established for each pair of topological and analytic invariants. The non-generic case of a maximal number of heteroclinic connections is also given a classification. The bifurcation diagram for the quadratic case is presented.</description>

      <title>Abundance of weird quasiperiodic attractors in piecewise linear discontinuous maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a class of $n$-dimensional, $n\geq2$, piecewise linear discontinuous maps that can exhibit a new type of attractor, called a weird quasiperiodic attractor. While the dynamics associated with these attractors may appear chaotic, we prove that chaos cannot occur. The considered class of $n$-dimensional maps allows for any finite number of partitions, separated by various types of discontinuity sets. The key characteristic, beyond discontinuity, is that all functions defining the map have the same real fixed point. These maps cannot have hyperbolic cycles other than the fixed point itself. We consider the two-dimensional case in detail. We prove that in nongeneric cases, the restriction, or the first return, of the map to a segment of straight line is reducible to a piecewise linear circle map. The generic attractor, different from the fixed point, is a weird quasiperiodic attractor, which may coexist with other attractors or attracting sets. We illustrate the existence of these attractors through numerous examples, using functions with different types of Jacobian matrices, as well as with different types of discontinuity sets. In some cases, we describe possible mechanisms leading to the appearance of these attractors. We also give examples in the three-dimensional space. Several properties of this new type of attractor remain open for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Model reduction of nonlinear time-delay systems via ODE approximation and spectral submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delay dynamical systems inherently embody infinite-dimensional dynamics, thereby amplifying their complexity. This aspect is especially notable in nonlinear dynamical systems, which frequently defy analytical solutions and necessitate approximations or numerical methods. These requirements present considerable challenges for the real-time simulation and analysis of their nonlinear dynamics. To address these challenges, we present a model reduction framework for nonlinear time-delay systems using spectral submanifolds (SSMs). We first approximate the time-delay systems as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) without delay and then compute the SSMs and their associated reduced-order models (ROMs) of the ODE approximations. These SSM-based ROMs successfully predict the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the time-delay systems, including free and forced vibrations, and accurately identify critical features such as isolated branches in the forced response curves and bifurcations of periodic and quasi-periodic orbits. The efficiency and accuracy of the ROMs are demonstrated through examples of increasing complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.07089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a klt projective variety with numerically trivial canonical divisor. A surjective endomorphism $f:X\to X$ is amplified (resp.~quasi-amplified) if $f^*D-D$ is ample (resp.~big) for some Cartier divisor $D$. We show that after iteration and equivariant birational contractions, an quasi-amplified endomorphism will descend to an amplified endomorphism.
  As an application, when $X$ is Hyperk\"ahler, $f$ is quasi-amplified if and only if it is of positive entropy. In both cases, $f$ has Zariski dense periodic points. When $X$ is an abelian variety, we give and compare several cohomological and geometric criteria of amplified endomorphisms and endomorphisms with countable and Zariski dense periodic points (after an uncountable field extension).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^d$. We associate three objects to each approximation $(p,q)\in \mathbb{Z}^d\times \mathbb{N}$ of $\theta$: the projection of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d+1}$ to the hyperplane of the first $d$ coordinates along the approximating vector $(p,q)$; the displacement vector $(p - q\theta)$; and the residue classes of the components of the $(d + 1)$-tuple $(p, q)$ modulo all primes. All of these have been studied in connection with Diophantine approximation problems. We consider the asymptotic distribution of all of these quantities, properly rescaled, as $(p, q)$ ranges over the best approximants and $\epsilon$-approximants of $\theta$, and describe limiting measures on the relevant spaces, which hold for Lebesgue a.e. $\theta$. We also consider a similar problem for vectors $\theta$ whose components, together with 1, span a totally real number field of degree $d+1$. Our technique involve recasting the problem as an equidistribution problem for a cross-section of a one-parameter flow on an adelic space, which is a fibration over the space of $(d + 1)$-dimensional lattices. Our results generalize results of many previous authors, to higher dimensions and to joint equidistribution.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and $k[[z]]$ the ring of formal power series over $k$. In this paper, we study equations in the semigroup $z^2k[[z]]$ with the semigroup operation being composition. We prove a number of general results about such equations and provide some applications. In particular, we answer a question of Horwitz and Rubel about decompositions of ``even'' formal power series. We also show that every right amenable subsemigroup of $z^2k[[z]]$ is conjugate to a subsemigroup of the semigroup of monomials.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of a generic automorphism $f$ of a Stein manifold with the density property. Such manifolds include all linear algebraic groups. Even in the special case of $\mathbb C^n$, $n\geq 2$, most of our results are new. We study the Julia set, non-wandering set, and chain-recurrent set of $f$. We show that the closure of the set of saddle periodic points of $f$ is the largest forward invariant set on which $f$ is chaotic. This subset of the Julia set of $f$ is also characterised as the closure of the set of transverse homoclinic points of $f$, and equals the Julia set if and only if a certain closing lemma holds. Among the other results in the paper is a generalisation of Buzzard's holomorphic Kupka-Smale theorem to our setting.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics in two-dimensional coupling of quadratic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the structure and limitations of equi-M sets in two-dimensional Complex Quadratic Networks (CQNs). In particular, we aim to describe the relationship between the equi-M set and the parameter domains where the critical orbit converges to periodic attractors (pseudo-bulbs). The two-node case serves as a foundational testbed: its analytical tractability enables the identification of critical phenomena and their dependence on coupling, while offering insight into more general principles. The two-node case is also simple enough to allow for explicit coupling conditions that govern phase transitions between synchronized and desynchronized behavior.
  Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, the study reveals that while the period-1 pseudo-bulb closely tracks the boundary of the equi-M set near its main cusp, this correspondence breaks down for higher periods and in regions supporting coexisting attractors. These discrepancies highlight key differences between single-map and coupled dynamics, where equi-M sets no longer provide a full encoding of system combinatorics. These findings clarify the topological and dynamical behavior of low-dimensional CQNs and point toward a sharp increase in complexity as the number of nodes grows, laying the groundwork for future studies of high-dimensional dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Analysis of Alternating Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.</description>

      <title>Deep Koopman-layered Model with Universal Property Based on Toeplitz Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose deep Koopman-layered models with learnable parameters in the form of Toeplitz matrices for analyzing the transition of the dynamics of time-series data. The proposed model has both theoretical solidness and flexibility. By virtue of the universal property of Toeplitz matrices and the reproducing property underlying the model, we show its universality and generalization property. In addition, the flexibility of the proposed model enables the model to fit time-series data coming from nonautonomous dynamical systems. When training the model, we apply Krylov subspace methods for efficient computations, which establish a new connection between Koopman operators and numerical linear algebra. We also empirically demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on eigenvalue estimation of multiple Koopman operators for nonautonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of input-to-output stability for infinite-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a superposition theorem for input-to-output stability (IOS) of a broad class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems with outputs including both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. It contains, as a special case, the superposition theorem for input-to-state stability (ISS) of infinite-dimensional systems and the IOS superposition theorem for systems of ordinary differential equations known from the literature.
  To achieve this result, we introduce and examine several novel stability and attractivity concepts for infinite-dimensional systems with outputs: We prove criteria for the uniform limit property for systems with outputs, several of which are new already for systems with full-state output, we provide superposition theorems for systems which satisfy both the output Lagrange stability (OL) and IOS, give a sufficient condition for OL and characterize ISS in terms of IOS and input/output-to-state stability. Finally, by means of counterexamples, we illustrate the challenges appearing on the way of extension of the superposition theorems from the literature to infinite-dimensional systems with outputs.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problem of magnetically insulated diode: existence of solutions and complex bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the stationary self-consistent problem of magnetic insulation for a vacuum diode with space-charge limitation, described by a singularly perturbed Vlasov-Maxwell system of dimension 1.5. The case of insulated diode when the electrons are deflected back towards the cathode at the point $x^{*}$ is considered. First, the initial VM system is reduced to the nonlinear singular limit system of ODEs for the potentials of electric and magnetic fields. The second step deals with the limit system's reduction to the new nonlinear singular ODE equation for effective potential $\theta(x)$. The existence of non-negative solutions is proved for the last equation on the interval $[0, x^{*})$ where $\theta(x)&gt;0$. The most interesting and unexplored case is when $\theta(x)&lt;0$ on the interval $(x^{*}, 1]$ and corresponds to the case of an insulated diode. For the first time, a numerical analysis of complex bifurcation of solutions in insulated diode is considered for $\theta(x)&lt;0$ depending on parameters and boundary conditions. Bifurcation diagrams of the dependence of solution $\theta(x)$ on a free point (free boundary) $x^{*}$ were constructed. Insulated diode spacing is found.</description>

      <title>Non-alternating mean payoff games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and study a variant of the mean payoff games introduced by A. Ehrenfeucht and J. Mycielski. In this version, the second player makes an infinite sequence of moves only after the first player's sequence of moves has been decided and revealed. Such games occur in the computation of the covering radius of constrained systems, a quantity of interest in coding theory.</description>
