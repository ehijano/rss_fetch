      <title>Social homophily predicts evacuation destination choice and long-term displacement decisions after the Marshall Fire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid urbanization and climate change have contributed to a significant rise in the frequency and intensity of disasters, which have resulted in three million adults being displaced from their homes in the United States during the past year. Using large-scale mobility data, it is now possible to observe and analyze post-disaster mobility dynamics across a longer time period, compared to household surveys which are often limited in scale. However, much of the mobility data-driven research on evacuation and displacement destination choice behavior has often underemphasized the role of social factors, including individual preferences and social connections. To this end, we use large-scale data of anonymized GPS traces and online social connections from the Marshall Fires in Colorado, USA, to unravel the associations between social and behavioral factors and evacuation destinations and long-term displacement decisions. We find that behavioral characteristics and social homophily play a significant role in post-disaster mobility decisions. Conditioned on the same evacuation distance, evacuees chose locations that have a high sociodemographic homophily with their home locations, and locations that have more friendship connections, compared to the level of homophily they are spatially exposed to. The social homophily effect is stronger among White and educated populations than low income, and Black and Asian populations. This effect has significant implications for long-term disaster impacts and policymaking, as it is a significant predictor of displacement and return decisions. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating the social, behavioral, and economic characteristics to better understand and predict evacuation and displacement dynamics after disasters.</description>

      <title>Contested logistics: Resilience of strategic highways and railways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Military logistics rely heavily on public infrastructure, such as highways and railways, to transport troops, equipment, and supplies, linking critical installations through the Department of Defense's Strategic Highway Network and Strategic Rail Corridor Network. However, these networks are vulnerable to disruptions that can jeopardize operational readiness, particularly in contested environments where adversaries employ non-traditional threats to disrupt logistics, even within the homeland. This paper presents a contested logistics model that utilizes network science and Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate the robustness and resilience of strategic transportation networks under various disruption scenarios. By integrating GIS data to model logistics networks, simulating disruptions, and quantifying their impacts, we identified vulnerabilities in US power projection routes and assessed the resilience and robustness of highways and railways. Our findings reveal that highways are more resilient than railways, with greater capacity to absorb targeted disruptions. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing investments in highway infrastructure and reinforcing vulnerable road and rail segments, particularly in high-risk regions, to enhance the resilience of military logistics and maintain operational effectiveness in contested conditions.</description>

      <title>The stability of bi-polarization on dynamical directed graphs: an emergent game perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a co-evolutionary model of directed graphs and three opinions, i.e., conservative$(+)$, neutral$(\odot)$ and liberal$(-)$. Agents update both opinions and social relationships with bias. We find that an emergent game suffices to predict the stability of bi-polarization under a rare opinion updating limit and a large system size limit. The bi-polarization is stable if and only if the emergent game has an internal Nash equilibrium. The necessary and sufficient condition is explained by both risk dominance and evolutionary stability. This game approach facilitates us to reveal the stability of bi-polarization in empirical systems. Our work fosters the understanding of opinion formation for controversial topics, and shows a deep connection between opinion dynamics and evolutionary game theory.</description>

      <title>From Extraterrestrial Microbes to Alien Intelligence: Rebalancing Astronomical Research Priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the funding disparity in astronomical research priorities: the Habitable Worlds Observatory is planned to receive over $10 billion over the next two decades whereas extraterrestrial intelligence research receives nearly zero federal funding. This imbalance is in contrast to both scientific value and public interest, as 65% of Americans and 58.2% of surveyed astrobiologists believe extraterrestrial intelligence exists. Empirical psychological research demonstrates that humanity possesses greater resilience toward extraterrestrial contact than historically recognized. Contemporary studies reveal adaptive responses rather than mass panic, conflicting with the rationale for excluding extraterrestrial intelligence research from federal funding since 1993. The response to the recent interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exemplifies consequences of this underinvestment: despite discovery forecasts of a new interstellar object every few months for the coming decade, no funded missions exist to intercept or closely study these visitors from outside the Solar System. We propose establishing a comprehensive research program to explore both biosignatures and technosignatures on interstellar objects. This program would address profound public interest while advancing detection capabilities and enabling potentially transformative discoveries in the search for extraterrestrial life. The systematic exclusion of extraterrestrial intelligence research represents institutional bias rather than scientific limitation, requiring immediate reconsideration of funding priorities.</description>

      <title>Communication as a driver of change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication plays a pivotal role in driving change, influencing human behavior, and solving problems. Chapter 2 explores the pragmatic power of communication, drawing examples and research to illustrate its impact on people's perceptions and actions. The chapter examines how varied perceptions of reality impact responses and highlights the importance of understanding others' viewpoints to foster effective change. Key topics covered in this chapter include goal setting, dysfunctional solutions, and clouded perceptions. It also illustrates unconventional logics, such as paradoxes and contradictions, which can help break through emotional barriers. Practical tools and exercises are provided within a structured framework for guiding both personal and organizational change, offering insights on managing emotional and rational aspects to unlock potential and drive meaningful transformation. Chapter 3 explores the psychological and emotional barriers to change, highlighting emotions' critical role in overcoming resistance. It introduces different behavioral profiles encountered during change processes, from cooperative individuals to those resistant due to fear, anger, pain, or rigid beliefs. Additionally, it discusses twelve characteristics of influential change leaders, such as systemic thinking, courage, and wisdom, which are crucial for guiding teams through challenging transitions. The chapter emphasizes the need for tailored interventions, such as creating corrective emotional experiences, and offers strategic communication techniques to restructure perceptions. Through real-life examples and paradoxical approaches, it outlines practical methods to manage opposition and foster collaboration, ensuring sustainable change by addressing emotional dynamics alongside rational problem-solving.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness and Resilience of U.S. Strategic Highways: A Network Science Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network science is a powerful tool for analyzing transportation networks, offering insights into their structures and enabling the quantification of resilience and robustness. Understanding the underlying structures of transportation networks is crucial for effective infrastructure planning and maintenance. In military contexts, network science is valuable for analyzing logistics networks, critical for the movement and supply of troops and equipment. The U.S. Army's logistical success, particularly in the "fort-to-port" phase, relies heavily on the Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) in the U.S., which is a system of public highways crucial for military deployments. However, the shared nature of these networks with civilian users introduces unique challenges, including vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and physical sabotage, which is highlighted by the concept of contested logistics. This paper proposes a method using network science and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess the robustness and resilience of transportation networks, specifically applied to military logistics. Our findings indicate that while the STRAHNET is robust against targeted disruptions, it is more resilient to random disruptions.</description>

      <title>In the Network of the Conclave: Social Connections and the Making of a Pope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study brings a network perspective to papal elections by mapping the relational architecture of the College of Cardinals. Using publicly available data sources, such as official Vatican directories and episcopal consecration records, we assemble a multiplex network that captures cardinals' co-membership in various collegial bodies of the Vatican and their consecration ties. We then calculate structural metrics to capture three key mechanisms that we suggest have a crucial role in the dynamics of the conclave: status, mediation power, and coalition building. Our descriptive study -- publicly released prior to the May 8, 2025 election of Pope Leo XIV -- shows that Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, largely ignored by pundits, bookmakers, and AI models, held a uniquely advantageous position in the Vatican network, by virtue of being central in multiple respects. Thus, although being considered an underdog by many, the network perspective suggests that Cardinal Prevost was de facto one of the strongest "papabile."</description>

      <title>Spectral-Space RG Theory Based on Universal Scaling Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08893v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale-free networks -- from the Internet to biological systems -- exhibit hierarchical organization that resists conventional renormalization group (RG) analysis. Their combination of scale invariance and small-world connectivity challenges standard RG methods, which rely on well-defined length scales. We resolve this challenge by formulating a spectral-space RG framework that captures both structural and dynamical scaling in complex networks. Leveraging the Laplacian eigenspectrum, we implement coarse-graining transformations unconstrained by geometry. This yields universal scaling relations connecting fractal dimensions, spectral dimensions, and degree exponents, establishing the first systematic foundation for network renormalization. A novel meta-graph reconstruction algorithm enables direct extraction of renormalized topologies from spectral data. We validate our predictions across diverse real-world networks and uncover new phenomena: evolving networks display multi-scaling behavior indicative of structural transitions, and spectral non-recursiveness reveals hidden dynamical correlations invisible in static topology. Applied to the European power grid, our method identifies latent connections between distant regions, consistent with observed fault propagation. Our results position spectral-space renormalization as a unified framework for analyzing scale-invariant networks, with broad implications for network science, infrastructure resilience, and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Information and motor constraints shape melodic diversity across cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. These results provide strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and suggests that a tendency for intermediate melodic complexity reflects a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</description>

      <title>Exploiting individual differences to bootstrap communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition.</description>
