      <title>Cutting soft materials: how material differences shape the response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cutting soft materials is a complex process governed by the interplay of bulk large deformation, interfacial soft fracture, and contact forces with the cutting tool. Existing experimental characterizations and numerical models often fail to capture the variety of observed cutting behaviors, especially the transition from indentation to cutting and the roles of dissipative mechanisms. Here, we combine novel experimental cutting tests on three representative materials-a soft hydrogel, elastomer, and food-based materials-with a coupled computational model that integrates soft fracture, adhesion, and frictional interactions. Our experiments reveal material-dependent cutting behaviors, with abrupt or smooth transitions from indentation to crack initiation, followed by distinct steady cutting regimes. The computational model captures these behaviors and shows that adhesion and viscous cohesive forces dominate tangential stresses, while Coulomb friction plays a negligible role due to low contact pressures. Together, these results provide new mechanistic insights into the physics of soft cutting and offer a unified framework to guide the design of soft materials, cutting tools, and cutting protocols, with direct relevance to surgical applications and the engineering of food textures optimized for mastication.</description>

      <title>Discrete dynamical stabilization of a naturally diverging mass in a harmonically time-varying potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:1709.00838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability and linear oscillatory behavior of a naturally diverging mass whose potential energy is harmonically modulated. It is known that in the Kapitza limit, i.e. when the period of modulation is much smaller than the diverging time, the collapsing mass can be dynamically stabilized and behave like an effective classic harmonic oscillator. We find that in the regime where the period of modulation is larger than the collapsing time of the mass, dynamical stabilization is still possible but in a discrete fashion. Only almost-periodic vibrational modes, or Floquet forms (FFs), are allowed that are located in independent stability stripes in the modulation parameter space. Reducing the FFs to their periodic eigenfunctions, one can transform the original equation of motion to a dimensionless Schr\"odinger stationary wave equation with a harmonic potential. This transformation allows for an analytical prediction of the stability stripes and the modal shapes of the vibrating mass. These results shed new light on the stability of linear dynamical systems, analytical solutions of Mathieu equations and on the relations between Initial and Boundary Value Problems.</description>

      <title>Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: External Forces and Corner Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics (Volume 20, Issue 6, June 2025), the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted, demonstrating that the models can accurately capture the nature of a variety of collision phenomena. In this article, the aforementioned models are augmented by modeling the effects of external forces as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</description>

      <title>Generalized Li\'enard systems and isochronous connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of the nonlinear Li\'enard equation $\ddot{x} + k x \dot{x} + \omega^2 x + (k^2/9) x^3 = 0$, where $x=x(t)$ is a real variable and $k, \omega \in \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate that such an equation could be derived from an equation of the Levinson-Smith kind which is of the form $\ddot{z} + J(z) \dot{z}^2 + F(z) \dot{z} + G(z) = 0$, where $z=z(t)$ is a real variable and $\{J(z), F(z), G(z)\}$ are suitable functions to be specified. It can further be mapped to the harmonic oscillator by making use of a nonlocal transformation, establishing its isochronicity. Computations employing the Jacobi last multiplier reveal that the system exhibits a bi-Hamiltonian character, i.e., there are two distinct types of Hamiltonians describing the system. For each of these, we perform a canonical quantization in the momentum representation and explore the possibility of bound states. While one of the Hamiltonians is seen to exhibit an equispaced spectrum with an infinite tower of states, the other one exhibits branching but can be solved exactly in closed form for certain choices of the parameters.</description>
