      <title>Performance of the FARICH-based particle identification at charm superfactories using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed study of the particle identification by the Focusing Aerogel Ring Imaging CHerenkov subsystem at the future charm superfactory detector is presented. The dedicated signal ring reconstruction algorithm is implemented in the detector simulation, the algorithm performance is tested with single particles generated within the Aurora framework. Two Boosted Decision Trees-based classifiers for the particle identification have been developed for various assumptions about photosensor noise levels. The approach is validated with the analysis of the D0-&gt;Kmunu decays, for which the systematic uncertainty and background contribution related to the pion/muon separation performance can be minimised due to high efficiency of the particle identification algorithm.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Analysis for Emissions of Scientific Computing Centres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a dedicated model to assist with the life cycle analysis of emissions of scientific computing centres. The model takes into account both the embodied carbon and emissions from use, as well as other factors such as data centre power usage efficiency, data centre expansion, hardware replacement, increase in energy efficiency of next-generation hardware, reduction in carbon intensity of the electricity supply and potential for heat reuse. If differs from existing models in its detailed handling of hardware embodied carbon and time dependency of various factors affecting the emissions. We present a number of scenarios where we apply the model to real-life HPC centres in different countries to illustrate how the trade-offs depend on the various factors and validate our model against the literature.</description>

      <title>A simulation model investigation of neutron-oxygen inelastic scattering and subsequent nucleus deexcitation based on experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadron interaction model for light nuclei plays an important role in understanding the event topology of neutrino-nucleus interaction in a large-scale neutrino detector. In the Super-Kamiokande experiment, the neutral current quasi-elastic interaction induced by atmospheric neutrinos introduces 68-82% uncertainty in the search for diffuse supernova neutrino background. This uncertainty stems from the mismodeling of the interaction between oxygen and fast neutrons generated by the neutral current quasi-elastic interaction, which is a crucial factor in the analysis. Therefore, a simulation study was performed, in which the newly released neutron-oxygen experimental data from the E487 and E525 experiments were compared. The result of comparing combinations of intranuclear cascade and deexcitation models is presented to choose a model that provides a superior prediction based on the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Search for neutron decay into an antineutrino and a neutral kaon in 0.401 megaton-years exposure of Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We searched for bound neutron decay via $n\to\bar{\nu}+K^0$ predicted by the Grand Unified Theories in 0.401 Mton$\cdot$years exposure of all pure water phases in the Super-Kamiokande detector. About 4.4 times more data than in the previous search have been analyzed by a new method including a spectrum fit to kaon invariant mass distributions. No significant data excess has been observed in the signal regions. As a result of this analysis, we set a lower limit of $7.8\times10^{32}$ years on the neutron lifetime at a 90% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Precision and rare ElectroWeak processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This proceeding summarizes recent measurements of electroweak boson and diboson production. The results, based on data from LHC Run 2 and Run 3 at $\sqrt{s}=13$ and $13.6\,\mathrm{TeV}$, probe the Standard Model with unprecedented precision. These include inclusive and differential cross-section measurements of $W$, $Z$, $WZ$, $WW$, and $ZZ$ final states, constraints on Parton Distribution Functions, and interpretations within Effective Field Theories. A consistent picture with theory predictions emerges, laying the groundwork for future precision studies.</description>

      <title>An independent search for Jovian neutrinos using BOREXINO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study, arXiv:2401.13043 found evidence for a 6% flux contribution from Jupiter to the total flux rate time series data from the BOREXINO solar neutrino experiment, specifically during the time intervals 2019-2021 and 2011-2013. The significance of this detection was estimated to be around $2\sigma$. We reanalyze the BOREXINO data and independently confirm the Jovian signal with the same amplitude and significance as that obtained in arXiv:2401.13043. However, using the same technique, we also find a spurious flux contribution from Venus and Saturn (at $\sim 2\sigma$ significance), whereas prima facie one should not expect any signal from any other planet. We then implement Bayesian model comparison to ascertain whether the BOREXINO data contain an additional contribution from Jupiter, Venus or Saturn. We find Bayes factors of less than five for an additional contribution from Jupiter, and less than or close to one for Venus and Saturn. This implies that the evidence for an additional contribution from Jupiter is very marginal.</description>

      <title>Review of Machine Learning for Real-Time Analysis at the Large Hadron Collider experiments ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of high energy physics (HEP) has seen a marked increase in the use of machine learning (ML) techniques in recent years. The proliferation of applications has revolutionised many aspects of the data processing pipeline at collider experiments including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this whitepaper, we discuss the increasingly crucial role that ML plays in real-time analysis (RTA) at the LHC, namely in the context of the unique challenges posed by the trigger systems of the large LHC experiments. We describe a small selection of the ML applications in use at the large LHC experiments to demonstrate the breadth of use-cases. We continue by emphasising the importance of collaboration and engagement between the HEP community and industry, highlighting commonalities and synergies between the two. The mutual benefits are showcased in several interdisciplinary examples of RTA from industrial contexts. This whitepaper, compiled by the SMARTHEP network, does not provide an exhaustive review of ML at the LHC but rather offers a high-level overview of specific real-time use cases.</description>

      <title>Measurements of differential cross-sections of $WbWb$ production in the dilepton channel in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the Large Hadron Collider, the $WbWb$ final state is expected to be dominated by $t\bar{t}$ production with a contribution from single-top processes. Differential cross-sections for $WbWb$ production in the dilepton decay channel are measured at the particle level as a function of various kinematic variables. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider over the period from 2015 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. Measurements are performed within the fiducial phase-space defined by the presence of two $b$-jets and one electron and one muon of opposite charges. The differential cross-sections are corrected for detector effects and unfolded to the particle level. Results are compared with predictions from Monte Carlo event generators at next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. These measurements provide valuable constraints on the modelling of $WbWb$ production and the interference between doubly resonant and singly resonant $WbWb$ production.</description>

      <title>Discrimination of neutron-$\gamma$ in the low energy regime using machine learning for an EJ-276D plastic scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present results for discrimination of neutron and $\gamma$ events using a plastic scintillator detector with pulse shape discrimination capabilities. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to improve the discriminatory power between neutron and $\gamma$ events at lower energy ranges which otherwise are not addressed by the conventional pulse shape discrimination techniques. The use of a multilayer perceptron with Bayesian inference (MLPBNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are studied using the recorded waveforms from the detector. Three variables are constructed for the input of ML algorithms, which captures the essence of the differences in the head and tail part of the neutron and $\gamma$ waveforms. The training and the testing of the ML algorithms are done using an AmBe neutron source. In the lower energy region, the results obtained from the ML predictions are compared with the results obtained from a time of flight (ToF) technique to benchmark the overall performance of the ML algorithms. A reasonable agreement is observed between the results obtained from ML algorithm and the ToF experiment in the studied energy range. The MLPBNN gives better discriminatory power for the neutron and $\gamma$ events than the SVM algorithm.</description>

      <title>Two Higgs Doublet Solutions to the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the strong CP problem in a broad class of two Higgs doublet theories that will be probed at the Large Hadron Collider and at future colliders.These theories feature CP and Abelian flavor symmetries, both broken softly in the scalar potential, that yield realistic quark masses and mixings. The flavor symmetry charges are chosen so that $\bar{\theta}=0$ at tree level for all values of the Yukawa and quartic couplings of the theory. We prove that in all such theories the 1-loop contribution to $\bar{\theta}$ also vanishes, independently of the mass scale of the second Higgs doublet. We study two illustrative models with flavor group $\mathbb{Z}_3$. The direct contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment are negligible in both models. While the 2-loop contribution to $\bar{\theta}$ is less than $10^{-12}$ in one model, it can be as large as $10^{-10}$ in the other, yielding the prospect of a signal in planned experiments. Even with Abelian flavor symmetries, CP violation in neutral kaon mixing is generally expected to yield naturalness bounds on the masses of additional Higgs doublets of order 20 TeV. We prove that for all models in our class, where the flavor symmetry forces $\bar{\theta}$ to vanish at tree-level, the flavor-changing neutral currents are CP-conserving, yielding model-dependent bounds from neutral meson mixing near 1 TeV. Mixing of the two CP-even scalars gives corrections to the couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs state to $\bar{t}t, \bar{b}b, \bar{c}c, \bar{\tau}\tau$ and $\bar{\mu} \mu$, giving possible signals at high luminosity runs at LHC and at future colliders. Furthermore, distinctive correlations between corrections in the various channels can probe the underlying flavor symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Determination of $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ at aN$^3$LO$_{\bf QCD}\otimes {\bf NLO}_{\bf QED}$ Accuracy from a Global PDF Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a determination of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ from a global dataset including both fixed-target and collider data from deep-inelastic scattering and a variety of hadronic processes, with a simultaneous determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) based on the NNPDF4.0 methodology. This determination is performed at NNLO and approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) perturbative QCD accuracy, including QED corrections and a photon PDF up to NLO accuracy. We extract $\alpha_s$ using two independent methodologies, both of which take into account the cross-correlation between $\alpha_s$ and the PDFs. The two methodologies are validated by closure tests that allow us to detect and remove or correct for several sources of bias, and lead to mutually consistent results. We account for all correlated experimental uncertainties, as well as correlated theoretical uncertainties related to missing higher order perturbative corrections (MHOUs). We study the perturbative convergence of our results and the impact of QED corrections. We assess individual sources of uncertainty, specifically MHOUs and the value of the top quark mass. We provide a detailed appraisal of methodological choices, including the choice of input dataset, the form of solution of evolution equation, the treatment of the experimental covariance matrix, and the details of Monte Carlo data generation. We find $\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1194^{+0.0007}_{-0.0014}$ at aN$^3$LO$_{\rm QCD}\otimes {\rm NLO}_{\rm QED}$ accuracy, consistent with the latest PDG average and with recent lattice results.</description>

      <title>Theory Uncertainties in the Extraction of $\alpha_s$ from Drell-Yan at Small Transverse Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed pseudodata study to estimate the expected theory uncertainty in the extraction of the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s(m_Z)$, from a fit to the measured Drell-Yan transverse momentum ($q_T$) spectrum at small $q_T \ll m_Z$. We consider two approaches to estimate the dominant perturbative uncertainties. We first discuss that the traditional approach based on varying unphysical scales is insufficient here because it cannot correctly account for bin-by-bin theory correlations in the $q_T$ spectrum, which are critically important in this case. We then use this case as a nontrivial application of a new approach based on theory nuisance parameters (TNPs), which encodes the correct theory correlations by construction. Moreover, the TNPs can be profiled in the fit thereby allowing the data to constrain the theory uncertainties in a consistent manner. We furthermore discuss the interplay with nonperturbative effects in the peak region $q_T \lesssim 10$ GeV, from where most of the $\alpha_s$ sensitivity originates. The associated nonperturbative uncertainties on $\alpha_s$ when fitting only the $q_T$ spectrum are large. They can in principle be reduced by including additional constraints on the nonperturbative Collins-Soper kernel from lattice QCD calculations. We find that these improvements in the treatment of perturbative and nonperturbative uncertainties and their correlations will enable a competitive $\alpha_s$ extraction from Drell-Yan data at small $q_T$. We also discuss the implications of our findings, calling into question a recent $\alpha_s$ extraction from the $Z$ $q_T$ spectrum by the ATLAS experiment.</description>

      <title>Deep-Inelastic Scattering at TeV Energies with LHC Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHC far-forward experiments FASER and SND@LHC have pioneered the detection of TeV-energy neutrinos produced in hard-scattering proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In addition to neutrinos, an intense flux of TeV-energy muons reaches these detectors, representing a dominant background for both neutrino studies and beyond the Standard Model searches. Here we demonstrate that this forward muon flux enables a comprehensive neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) program at FASER with a strong kinematical overlap with the Electron Ion Collider. For the Run 3 luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm pp}=250$~fb$^{-1}$, more than $10^5$ inclusive muon DIS events, of which up to $10^4$ for charm production, are expected at FASER$\nu$. As a representative application, we demonstrate the sensitivity of muon DIS at FASER$\nu$ to probe the (intrinsic) charm content of the proton at large-$x$. We also provide predictions for event yields of muon DIS for future FASER runs and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of jet substructure provide precise tests of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and offer a distinct way to study hadronization mechanisms, compared to measurements of hadrons alone. QCD predicts that jet radiation patterns depend on the mass and color charge of the initiating parton. Parton showers, in particular, are sensitive to the Casimir factors of quarks and gluons, as well as the parton mass due to the dead-cone effect. Three key charm-tagged jet measurements from the ALICE experiment are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The MiniCactus sensors are demonstrator sensors designed in LFoundry LF15A 150 nm technology, intended to study the performance of non amplified High Voltage High Resistivity CMOS sensors for measurement of time of arrival of charged particles. This paper presents the context, design features and some of the first test-beam results obtained with the latest MiniCactus sensor version, MiniCactus V2. With a 175 micron thick sensor biased at -350 V, we have obtained a 60 ps time resolution on Minimum Ionizing Particles detected with a 500 micron by 500 micron pixel.</description>

      <title>Identification of $D^*_2(3000)$ as the $D_2^*(2^3P_2)$ and exploring potential of undiscovered $2^+$ mesons via $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the discovery of the $D^*_2(3000)$, its mass and full width have been extensively studied. Yet its nature remains undetermined to date. Since it was discovered through nonleptonic decay of $B$ meson and the corresponding cascade process, we therefore in this paper investigate the nonleptonic and semileptonic decays of $B$ meson to $J^P = 2^+$ charmed mesons using the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. Our calculations on nonleptonic $B$ decays reveal that the unconfirmed resonance $D^*_2(3000)$ aligns well with $D^*_2(2^3P_2)$ predictions. Other candidates, including $D^*_2(1^3F_2)$, $D^*_2(3^3P_2)$, and $D^*_2(2^3F_2)$, are excluded due to their very small branching ratios in $B$ decays. Considering that the $D^*_2(1F)$, $D^*_2(3P)$, and $D^*_2(2F)$ have not yet been experimentally observed, we investigate the feasibility of their detection in $B$-meson decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological studies are carried out to find the potential reach of a detector to constraints on possible beyond the standard model general neutrino interactions in the neutrino-quark sector, for the proposed Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment (ICNSE) at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India. Reactors of different core configuration and power are used as sources of electron antineutrinos. The study has been carried out considering a target mass of 10 kg and an exposure of one year. It has been found that the ICNSE detector has a significant capacity to limit the majority of the Non-standard Interaction(NSI) parameter space. It has also been observed that a combination of results from two different types of detectors such as sapphire and high-purity germanium can significantly improve sensitivity by reducing the degeneracies between some pairs of NSI parameters to a smaller region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a pseudoscalar toponium state at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) opens a new avenue for the study of a novel class of QCD bound states with comparable formation and decay times. Compared to charmonium and bottomonium, toponium is a more loosely bound state, resembling a hydrogen atom of the strong interactions, although it appears as a broader resonance. We compute the masses and annihilation decay widths of the lowest $S$-wave ($\eta_t$, $\psi_t$) and $P$-wave ($\chi_{t0}$, $\chi_{t1}$) toponium states, and assess their discovery prospects at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and future lepton colliders such as the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) and $e^+e^-$ stage of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). Detecting the vector $\psi_t$ state at the HL-LHC is hindered by the Landau-Yang theorem and the collider's gluon-dominated nature, while lepton colliders offer discoverable sensitivity through both constituent and two-body decays. A more precise measurement of $\eta_t$ mass (approximately equal to that of $\psi_t$) at the LHC could help determine the optimal $t\bar{t}$ threshold center-of-mass energy for CEPC and FCC-ee. $P$-wave states remain challenging to observe at both the HL-LHC and future lepton colliders. We also discuss how we can use toponium measurements to probe top quark properties and to conduct indirect searches for new physics, including light scalars coupling to the top quark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of an Omnivision OV5647 CMOS image sensor (5 Mp) for detecting radiation from Sr90 and Cs137 sources. Our experimental setup uses a Raspberry Pi 3 mini-computer for data acquisition, with image processing using Python and OpenCV libraries. We specify the necessary settings to convert a standard camera into a particle detector sensitive to electrons and photons, including a two-step background filtering procedure. In addition, we implement the first detailed Geant4 simulation that describes the layered geometry and material composition of a commercial CMOS sensor along with the radioactive sources. To enhance the simulation, we include an algorithm for charge diffusion and conversion of the energy deposited by electrons and photons into ADC counts. Our measurements are presented in terms of cluster size, the maximum ADC signal per cluster, and the number of clusters as a function of distance. We find a good agreement between the experimental data and simulation for all these observables, and we can reproduce the correlation between cluster size and maximum ADC signal per cluster. Thus, this simulation, cross-checked with data, can be used to test the feasibility of further particle detection ideas without the need to implement an experimental setup. However, the sensor has limited primary energy resolution and is thus unable to distinguish between different radioactive sources. Nevertheless, given the accurate measurement of energy deposition, the sensor, once calibrated, is suitable for dosimetric measurements of source activities.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $t$-channel production of single top quarks and antiquarks in $pp$ collisions at 13 TeV using the full ATLAS Run 2 data sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of single top quarks and top antiquarks via the $t$-channel exchange of a virtual $W$ boson is measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC using $140\,\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ of ATLAS data. The total cross-sections are determined to be $\sigma(tq)=137^{+8}_{-8}\,\mathrm{pb}$ and $\sigma(\bar{t}q)=84^{+6}_{-5}\,\mathrm{pb}$ for top-quark and top-antiquark production, respectively. The combined cross-section is found to be $\sigma(tq+\bar{t}q)=221^{+13}_{-13}\,\mathrm{pb}$ and the cross-section ratio is $R_{t}=\sigma(tq)/\sigma(\bar{t}q)=1.636^{+0.036}_{-0.034}$. The predictions at next-to-next-to-leading-order in quantum chromodynamics are in good agreement with these measurements. The predicted value of $R_{t}$ using different sets of parton distribution functions is compared with the measured value, demonstrating the potential to further constrain the functions when using this result in global fits. The measured cross-sections are interpreted in an effective field theory approach, setting limits at the 95% confidence level on the strength of a four-quark operator and an operator coupling the third quark generation to the Higgs boson doublet: $-0.37 &lt; C_{Qq}^{3,1}/\Lambda^2 &lt; 0.06$ and $-0.87 &lt; C_{\phi Q}^{3}/\Lambda^2 &lt; 1.42$. The constraint $|V_{tb}|&gt;0.95$ at the 95% confidence level is derived from the measured value of $\sigma(tq+\bar{t}q)$. In a more general approach, pairs of CKM matrix elements involving top quarks are simultaneously constrained, leading to confidence contours in the corresponding two-dimensional parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the neutrino transmission coefficient at high energies to the Earth's density profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flux of atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos measured in UHE neutrino detectors is strongly dependent on the description of the propagation and absorption of the neutrinos during the passage through Earth to the detector. In particular, the attenuation of the incident neutrino flux depends on the details of the matter structure between the source and the detector. In this paper, we will investigate the impact of different descriptions for the density profile of Earth on the transmission coefficient, defined as the ratio between the flux measured in the detector and the incoming neutrino flux. We will consider five different models for the Earth's density profile and estimate how these different models modify the target column density and transmission coefficients for different flavors. The results are derived by solving the cascade equations taking into account the NC interactions and tau regeneration. A comparison with approximated solutions is also presented. Our results indicated that the predictions are sensitive to the model considered for the density profile, with the simplified three layer model providing a satisfactory description when compared with the PREM results.</description>

Abstract: We present the first part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions in the low-energy effective field theory (LEFT): the effects at dimension five in the power counting. Our calculation is performed in a basis with generic mass matrices, we employ the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, and we correct for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects by including the appropriate finite counterterms. We also provide results for the $CP$-even sector in a scheme that coincides with naive dimensional regularization. We discuss two methods to avoid the explicit construction of gauge-variant operators, which in principle are needed for the cancellation of sub-divergences, even in the background-field method. The two methods are consistent with each other and with existing partial results. Our work is a further step towards a complete EFT framework for physics beyond the Standard Model at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Probing triple-gauge couplings in anomalous gauge theories at hadron and lepton colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge anomalous quantum field theories are inconsistent as full UV theories since they lead to the breaking of Lorentz invariance or Unitarity, as well as non-renormalizability. It is well known, however, that they can be interpreted as effective field theories (EFT) with a cut-off. The latter cannot be made arbitrarily large and it is related to the energy scale at which additional fermions with suitable gauge charges enter, rendering the full model anomaly-free. A nondecoupling effect that remains in the EFT is the appearance of anomalous loop-induced triple-gauge couplings, encapsulating information from the full UV theory. In this work we take as an example an Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)'_\mu$ under which $2^{nd}$-generation leptons are axially charged, leading to an EFT that consists of the Standard Model (SM) with an additional massive $Z'$ gauge boson. As a consequence, there are triple gauge couplings involving the $Z'$ and Electroweak SM gauge bosons via mixed gauge anomalies. We study the possibility of probing these loop suppressed anomalous couplings at hadron and lepton colliders, with $Z'$-lepton couplings allowed by current experimental bounds, finding that due to the large SM backgrounds and small signal, the HL-LHC is incapable of this task. The 100 TeV $pp$ collider at $\mathcal{L}=20~\mathrm {ab}^{-1}$ on the other hand could probe anomalous couplings for $m_{Z'}\in[150,800]~\mathrm{GeV}$ and obtain discovery significances for $m_{Z'}\in[230,330]~\mathrm{GeV}$. Lepton colliders are also well suited for probing these anomalous couplings. In particular we show that a muon collider running at the $Z'$-resonance and an electron-positron collider such as CLIC with $\sqrt{s}=3~{\rm TeV}$ can be complimentary in probing the anomalous couplings for $m_{Z'}\in[100,700]~{\rm GeV}$, with CLIC sensitive to discovery for $m_{Z'}\in[125,225]~{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Astronomy Beyond the Standard Model: New Window from Quantum Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic (ULB) fields with mass $m_{\phi} \ll 1$~eV often arise in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such fields exist, violent astrophysical events that result in emission of gravitational wave, photon, or neutrino signals could also produce bursts of high-density relativistic ULB fields. Detection of such ULB fields in terrestrial or space-based laboratories correlated with other signals from transient astrophysical events opens a novel avenue for multimessenger astronomy. We show that quantum sensors are particularly well-suited to observe emitted scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like ULB fields coupled to SM. We demonstrate that multimessenger astronomy with ULB fields is possible even when accounting for matter screening effects.</description>

Abstract: As stated in the 2019 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), it is of the utmost importance that the HL-LHC upgrade of the accelerator and the experiments be successfully completed in a timely manner. All necessary efforts should be devoted to achieving this goal. We also recall two of the principal recommendations of the 2019 ESPP for future accelerator initiatives, namely that 1) An electron-positron Higgs factory is the highest priority for the next collider (Rec. c). 2) Europe, together with its international partners, should investigate the technical and financial feasibility of a future hadron collider at CERN with a centre-of-mass energy of at least 100 TeV and with an electron-positron Higgs and electroweak factory as a possible first stage (Rec. e). A major objective in particle physics is always to operate an accelerator that allows a leap of an order of magnitude in the constituent centre-of-mass energy with respect to the previous one. We support FCC-ee and FCC-hh as the preferred option for CERN future, as it addresses both of the above recommendations.
  The guidance for the 2025 ESPP requests, in addition to the preferred option, the inclusion of ``prioritised alternatives to be pursued if the chosen preferred option turns out not to be feasible or competitive''. Proposed alternatives to the preferred FCC option include linear, muon colliders and LHeC accelerators. In response to this request we propose reusing the existing LHC tunnel for an electron-positron collider, called LEP3, as a back-up alternative if the FCC cannot proceed. LEP3 leverages much of the R\&amp;D conducted for FCC-ee, offers high-precision studies of Z, W, and Higgs bosons below the tt threshold, and offers potential physics performance comparable or superior to other fallback options at a lower cost while supporting continued R\&amp;D towards a next-generation energy frontier machine.</description>

Abstract: As in previous decades, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate internal configuration of hadrons continues to be a central objective within both experimental and theoretical hadron physics. This pursuit plays a pivotal role in advancing our knowledge of QCD and critically evaluating the robustness and accuracy of the theoretical models developed to date. Furthermore, deciphering the underlying mechanisms of exotic states, both those currently observed and those anticipated in future experiments, remains a pressing and unresolved challenge. Motivated by this, in the present study, we investigate the electromagnetic properties of the $D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular tetraquark states with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$, using the QCD light-cone sum rule method. These states are analyzed within a hadronic molecular framework, where their magnetic and quadrupole moments are computed to probe internal structure and geometric deformation. Our results reveal distinct electromagnetic signatures, with the magnetic moments primarily dominated by light-quark contributions, and the quadrupole moments suggesting an oblate charge distribution. The findings are compared with prior studies assuming compact tetraquark configurations, emphasizing the sensitivity of electromagnetic observables to the underlying hadronic structure. This analysis provides critical insights into the nature of exotic hadrons and contributes to the broader understanding of QCD dynamics in the non-perturbative regime.</description>
