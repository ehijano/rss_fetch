      <title>Local knots and the prime factorization of links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present note contains a new proof of Y. Hashizume's 1958 theorem that every non-split link in $S^3$ admits a unique factorization into prime links. While the new proof does not go far beyond standard techniques, it is considerably shorter than the original proof and avoids most of its case exhaustion.
  We apply this proof to obtain a string link version (and also an alternative proof) of a 1972 theorem of D. Rolfsen: two PL links in $S^3$ are ambient isotopic if and only if they are PL isotopic and their respective components are ambient isotopic. It is tempting to dismiss this string link version as obvious by deriving it directly either from Rolfsen's or Hashizume's theorem. But this does not seem to be possible, as it turns out that there exists a string link that has no local knots, while its closure has a local knot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the rigidity of Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ quantum representations of mapping class groups at all prime levels for closed surfaces of genus at least $7$. The proof relies on Ocneanu rigidity of modular categories and harmonic representatives in Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Singular instanton homology of dual knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a dimension formula for the unreduced singular instanton homology of dual knots $\widetilde{K}_{p/q}\subset S^3_{p/q}(K)$ for a knot $K\subset S^3$: $$ \dim I^\sharp(S^3_{p/q}(K),\widetilde{K}_{p/q},\omega; \mathbb{K}) = 2q \cdot r_{\mathbb{K}}(K) + 2|p - q \cdot \nu^\sharp_{\mathbb{K}}(K)|~\mathrm{for}~p/q\neq \nu^\sharp_{\mathbb{K}}(K), $$where $\omega\subset S^3\backslash K$ is any unoriented $1$-submanifold as the bundle set, $r_{\mathbb{K}}(K)$ and $\nu^\sharp_{\mathbb{K}}(K)$ are integers from the dimension formula of $I^\sharp(S^3_{p/q}(K);\mathbb{K})$ for a field $\mathbb{K}$ defined by Li and the author. In particular, when $\mathbb{K}$ is the two-element field $\mathbb{F}_2$, the reduced singular instanton homology satisfies\[\dim I^\natural(S^3_{p/q}(K),\widetilde{K}_{p/q},\omega;\mathbb{F}_2)=\dim I^\sharp(S^3_{p/q}(K);\mathbb{F}_2)~\mathrm{for}~p/q\neq \nu^\sharp_{\mathbb{F}_2}(K).\]As an application, for a determinant-one knot $K\subset S^3$ other than the unknot and the torus knots $T_{2,3},T_{2,5}$ and a rational $p/q\in (0,6)$ with $p$ odd prime power, the surgery manifold $\widehat{Y}_{p/2q}(\widehat{K})$ is not $SU(2)$-abelian for the double branched cover $\widehat{Y}=\Sigma(S^3,K)$ and the preimage $\widehat{K}\subset \widehat{Y}$ of $K$. We also obtain non-abelian results for $SU(2)$ representations of the knot complement that send the curves of some fixed slope in $(0,6)$ to traceless elements.</description>

      <title>Minimal Generating sets of Reidemeister moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine whether each known generating set of arbitrary oriented Reidemeister moves is minimal. We then provide a complete classification of minimal generating sets that include a coherent Reidemeister move of type II. We also classify all minimal generating sets that include a braid-type Reidemeister move of type III. Beyond these two cases, we identify 16 possible candidates for minimal generating sets. Among them, we prove that 12 are indeed minimal, whereas the minimality and even the generating property of the remaining 4 sets remains unsolved (Remark 5.1).</description>

      <title>Vassiliev invariants for virtual knotoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20269v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce three invariants of virtual knotoids. Two of them are smoothing invariants $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ which take values in a free $\mathbb Z$-module generated by non-oriented flat virtual knotoids. We prove that $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ are both Vassiliev invariants of order one. Moreover we construct a universal Vassiliev invariant $\mathcal{G}$ of order one of virtual knotoids. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{G}$ is stronger than $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{L}$. To prove this result, we extend the singular based matrix invariant for singular virtual strings introduced by Turaev and Henrich to singular virtual open strings corresponding to singular flat virtual knotoids with one singular crossing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two crossed homomorphisms on a braid group, one defined diagrammatically and the other defined algebraically. We show that these crossed homomorphisms are essentially the same, and compute them in detail for simple braids, namely elements conjugate to the standard generators of the braid group or to their inverses.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between three combinatorial objects -- a taffy pulling machine, the Calkin-Wilf tree of all fractions, and Conway's rational tangles. After introducing these objects, we develop a taffy analogue for Conway's characterization of rational tangles, and we give a direct geometric connection between rational tangles and taffy pulls.</description>

      <title>Euler's work on spherical geometry: An overview with comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review Euler's work on spherical geometry. After an introduction concerning the general place that trigonometric formulae occupy in geometry, we start by the two memoirs of Euler on spherical trigonometry, in which he establishes the trigonometric formulae using different methods, namely, the calculus of variations in the first memoir, and classical methods of solid geometry in the other. In another memoir, Euler gives several formulae for the area of a spherical triangle in terms of its side lengths (these are ``spherical Heron formulae''). He uses this in the computation of numerical values of the solid angles of the five regular polyhedra, which is his goal in his memoir. We then review memoirs in which Euler systematically starts by establishing a theorem or a construction in Euclidean geometry and then proves an analogue in spherical geometry. We point out relations between Euler's memoirs on spherical trigonometry and works he did in astronomy, on the problem of drawing geographical maps, and in geomagnetism. We also review some other works of Euler involving spheres, including a memoir on the three-dimensional Apollonius problem and others concerning algebraic curves on the sphere. Even though these works are not properly on spherical geometry, they show Euler's interests in various questions related to spheres and we think that they are worth highlighting in such an overview. Beyond spherical geometry, the reader is invited to discover in this article an important facet of the work of the great Leonhard Euler. This article will appear as a chapter in the book ``Spherical geometry in the eighteenth century, I: Euler, Lagrange and Lambert'', Springer, 2026.</description>

      <title>Complex slices on a real variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a real algebraic variety with set of complex points $X_{\mathbb C}$ and set of real points $X_{\mathbb R}$. A complex slice of $X$ is a transverse intersection of $X_{\mathbb R}$ with a complex subvariety $V$ of $X_{\mathbb C}$. Complex slices are real algebraic varieties of a very special kind. They are cooriented, realize an integer cohomology class. A codimension 2 projective variety is a slice, iff it is a base of pencil of real algebraic hypersurfaces. We prove an upper bound for the linking number of a real projective curve bounding in its complexification with a slice of codimension two.</description>

      <title>Higher property T and below-rank phenomena of lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. We explore higher property T as an abstract group-theoretic property. In particular, we provide new operator-algebraic characterizations of higher property T. Then we turn to lattices in semisimple Lie groups. We relate higher property T to other cohomological, rigidity and geometric phenomena below the real rank. The second part outlines a conjectural framework that unifies these aspects and reviews recent advances.</description>

      <title>On knots that divide ribbon knotted surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15577v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a knot to be half ribbon if it is the cross-section of a ribbon 2-knot, and observe that ribbon implies half ribbon implies slice. We introduce the half ribbon genus of a knot K, the minimum genus of a ribbon knotted surface of which K is a cross-section. We compute this genus for all prime knots up to 12 crossings, and many 13-crossing knots. The same approach yields new computations of the doubly slice genus. We also introduce the half fusion number of a knot K, that measures the complexity of ribbon 2-knots of which K is a cross-section. We show that it is bounded from below by the Levine-Tristram signatures, and differs from the standard fusion number by an arbitrarily large amount.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kreck and Schafer produced the first examples of stably diffeomorphic closed smooth 4-manifolds which are not homotopy equivalent. They were constructed by applying the doubling construction to 2-complexes over certain finite abelian groups of odd order. By extending their methods, we formulate a new homotopy invariant on the class of 4-manifolds arising as doubles of 2-complexes with finite fundamental group. As an application we show that, for any $k \ge 2$, there exist a family of $k$ closed smooth 4-manifolds which are all stably diffeomorphic but are pairwise not homotopy equivalent.</description>

      <title>Flat extensions of principal connections and the Chern-Simons $3$-form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

      <title>A chain-level model for Chas-Sullivan products in Morse homology with differential graded coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of Morse theory with differential graded coefficients to study certain operations on the total space of a fibration. More particularly, we focus in this paper on a chain-level description of the Chas-Sullivan product on the homology of the free loop space of an oriented, closed and connected manifold. The idea of ''intersecting on the base'' and ''concatenating on the fiber'' are well-adapted to this framework. We also give a Morse theoretical description of other products that follow the same principle. For this purpose, we develop functorial properties with respect to the coefficient in terms of morphisms of A $\infty$ -modules and morphisms of fibrations. We also build a differential graded version of the K{\"u}nneth formula and of the Pontryagin-Thom construction.</description>
