      <title>Efficient Runtime Verification of Real-Time Systems under Parametric Communication Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timed B\"uchi automata provide a very expressive formalism for expressing requirements of real-time systems. Online monitoring and active testing of embedded real-time systems can then be achieved by symbolic execution of such automata on the trace observed from the system. This direct construction however only is faithful if observation of the trace is immediate in the sense that the monitor (or test harness, respectively) can assign exact time stamps to the actions it observes, which is rarely true in practice due to the substantial and fluctuating parametric delays introduced by the circuitry connecting the observed system to its monitoring or testing device.
  We present purely zone-based online monitoring and testing algorithms, which handle such parametric delays exactly without recurrence to costly verification procedures for parametric timed automata. We have implemented our algorithms on top of the real-time model checking tool UPPAAL, and report on encouraging initial results.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Assumptions for Effective Monitoring of Real-Time Properties under Partial Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Runtime verification of temporal properties is essential for ensuring the correctness and reliability of real-time systems, particularly in cyber-physical systems. A significant challenge in this domain is the effective prediction of property failure or success, especially when dealing with partially observable systems. This paper addresses these challenges by developing an Assumption-Based Runtime Verification (ABRV) approach for a continuous real-time setting. Our method exploits assumptions about the system's behavior, specified as Timed Automata, to enable monitors to predict future outcomes and handle unobservable system parts, such as internal faults. Properties to be monitored are specified using Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL). The approach also includes formalizing observations with data and time uncertainty using sequences of timed constraints. We present a zone-based online algorithm for computing the monitoring verdict, implemented on top of the UPPAAL tool. Experimental evaluation on proof-of-concept cases demonstrates the approach's feasibility and effectiveness, illustrating how assumptions facilitate earlier verdicts, enable monitoring of properties dependent on unobservable events, and provide insights into scalability.</description>

      <title>Conservative Perception Models for Probabilistic Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying the behaviors of autonomous systems with learned perception components is a challenging problem due to the complexity of the perception and the uncertainty of operating environments. Probabilistic model checking is a powerful tool for providing guarantees on stochastic models of systems. However, constructing model-checkable models of black-box perception components for system-level mathematical guarantees has been an enduring challenge. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing provably conservative Interval Markov Decision Process (IMDP) models of closed-loop systems with perception components. We prove that our technique results in conservative abstractions with a user-specified probability. We evaluate our approach in an automatic braking case study using both a synthetic perception component and the object detector YOLO11 in the CARLA driving simulator.</description>

      <title>Time for Timed Monitorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring is an important part of the verification toolbox, in particular in situations where exhaustive verification using, e.g., model-checking is infeasible. The goal of online monitoring is to determine the satisfaction or violation of a specification during runtime, i.e., based on finite execution prefixes. However, not every specification is amenable to monitoring, e.g., properties for which no finite execution can witness satisfaction or violation. Monitorability is the question of whether a given specification is amenable to monitoring, and has been extensively studied in discrete time.
  Here, we study the monitorability problem for real-time properties expressed as Timed Automata. For specifications given by deterministic Timed Muller Automata, we prove decidability while we show that the problem is undecidable for specifications given by nondeterministic Timed B\"uchi automata.
  Furthermore, we refine monitorability to also determine bounds on the number of events as well as the time that must pass before monitoring the property may yield an informative verdict. We prove that for deterministic Timed Muller automata, such bounds can be effectively computed. In contrast we show that for nondeterministic Timed B\"uchi automata such bounds are not computable.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Upward-Closed Sets of Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of a result from well quasi-order theory on the computability of bases for upwards-closed sets of words. This new proof is based on Angluin's L* algorithm, that learns an automaton from a minimally adequate teacher. This relates in particular two results from the 1980s: Angluin's L* algorithm, and a result from Valk and Jantzen on the computability of bases for upwards-closed sets of tuples of integers.
  Along the way, we describe an algorithm for learning quasi-ordered automata from a minimally adequate teacher, and extend a generalization of Valk and Jantzen's result, encompassing both words and integers, to finitely generated monoids.</description>

      <title>Games on Graphs: From Logic and Automata to Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this book is to give a comprehensive presentation of the research field concerned with infinite duration games on graphs. Historically, these game models appeared in the study of automata and logic, and they later became important for program verification and synthesis. They have many more applications, in particular some of the models investigated in this book were introduced and studied in neighbouring research communities such as optimisation, reinforcement learning, model theory, and set theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized De Bruijn Words, Invertible Necklaces, and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define generalized de Bruijn words as those words having a Burrows-Wheeler transform that is a concatenation of permutations of the alphabet. We show that generalized de Bruijn words are in 1-to-1 correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized de Bruijn graphs introduced in the early '80s in the context of network design. When the size of the alphabet is a prime $p$, we define invertible necklaces as those whose BWT-matrix is non-singular. We show that invertible necklaces of length $n$ correspond to normal bases of the finite field $F_{p^n}$, and that they form an Abelian group isomorphic to the Reutenauer group $RG_p^n$. Using known results in abstract algebra, we can make a bridge between generalized de Bruijn words and invertible necklaces. In particular, we highlight a correspondence between binary de Bruijn words of order $d+1$, binary necklaces of length $2^{d}$ having an odd number of $1$'s, invertible BWT matrices of size $2^{d}\times 2^{d}$, and normal bases of the finite field $F_{2^{2^{d}}}$.</description>

      <title>Prophecies all the Way: Game-based Model-Checking for HyperQPTL beyond $\forall^*\exists^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-checking HyperLTL, a temporal logic expressing properties of sets of traces with applications to information-flow based security and privacy, has a decidable, but TOWER-complete, model-checking problem. While the classical model-checking algorithm for full HyperLTL is automata-theoretic, more recently, a game-based alternative for the $\forall^*\exists^*$-fragment has been presented.
  Here, we employ imperfect information-games to extend the game-based approach to full HyperQPTL, which features arbitrary quantifier prefixes and quantification over propositions and can express every $\omega$-regular hyperproperty. As a byproduct of our game-based algorithm, we obtain finite-state implementations of Skolem functions via transducers with lookahead that explain satisfaction or violation of HyperQPTL properties.</description>
