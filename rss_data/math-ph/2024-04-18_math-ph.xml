      <title>Two-Dimensional Coulomb Gas on an Elliptic Annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that two-dimensional Coulomb gases at a special inverse temperature $\beta = 2$ can be analyzed by using the orthogonal polynomial method borrowed from the theory of random matrices. In this paper, such Coulomb gas molecules are studied when they are distributed on an elliptic annulus, and the asymptotic forms of the molecule correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit are evaluated. For that purpose, two-dimensional orthogonality relations of the Chebyshev polynomials on an elliptic annulus are utilized.</description>

      <title>On an Internal Dependence of Simultaneous Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that there exists an internal dependence of the simultaneous measurements made by the two pairs of linear polarizers operated in each leg of the apparatus in Aspect's version of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm Gedankenexperiment. The corresponding Shannon-Kolmogorov's information flow linking a polarizer from one leg to a polarizer from the other leg is proportional to the absolute value of this function of dependence. It turns out that if Bell's inequality is violated, then this information flow is strictly positive, that is, the experiment performed at one leg is informationally dependent on the experiment at the other leg. By throwing out the sign of absolute value, we define the signed information flow linking a polarizer from one leg to a polarizer from the other leg which, in turn, reproduces the probabilities of the four outcomes of the simultaneous measurements, predicted by quantum mechanics. We make an attempt to illustrate the seeming random relation between the total information flow, the total signed information flow, and the violation of Bell's inequality in terms of a kind of uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>On the relaxation to equilibrium of a quantum oscillator interacting with a radiation field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate from the point of view of spectral theory the problem of relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium of a quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a radiation field. Our starting point is a system of infinitely many Pauli master equations governing the time evolution of the occupation probabilities of the available quantum states. The system we consider is derived from the evolution equation for the reduced density operator obtained after the initial interaction of the oscillator with the radiation field, the latter acting as a heat bath. We provide a complete spectral analysis of the infinitesimal generator of the equations, showing thereby that it generates an infinite-dimensional system of hyperbolic type. This implies that every global solution to the equations converge exponentially rapidly toward the corresponding Gibbs equilibrium state. We also provide a complete spectral analysis of a linear pencil naturally associated with the Pauli equations. All of our considerations revolve around the notion of compactness, more specifically around the existence of a new compact embedding result involving a space of sequences of Sobolev type into a weighted space of square-integrable summable sequences.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods and improvements for simulating quasi-static elastoplastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypo-elastoplasticity is a framework suitable for modeling the mechanics of many hard materials that have small elastic deformation and large plastic deformation. In most laboratory tests for these materials the Cauchy stress is in quasi-static equilibrium. Rycroft et al. discovered a mathematical correspondence between this physical system and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and developed a projection method similar to Chorin's projection method (1968) for incompressible Newtonian fluids. Here, we improve the original projection method to simulate quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity, by making three improvements. First, drawing inspiration from the second-order projection method for incompressible Newtonian fluids, we formulate a second-order in time numerical scheme for quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity. Second, we implement a finite element method for solving the elliptic equations in the projection step, which provides both numerical benefits and flexibility. Third, we develop an adaptive global time-stepping scheme, which can compute accurate solutions in fewer timesteps. Our numerical tests use an example physical model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory, but the numerical methods can be applied to any elastoplastic material.</description>

      <title>A class of Schwarz qubit maps with diagonal unitary and orthogonal symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of unital qubit maps displaying diagonal unitary and orthogonal symmetries is analyzed. Such maps already found a lot applications in quantum information theory. We provide a complete characterization of this class of maps showing intricate relation between positivity, operator Schwarz inequality, and complete positivity. Finally, it is shown how to generalize the entire picture beyond unital case (so called generalized Schwarz maps). Interestingly, the first example of Schwarz but not completely positive map found by Choi belongs to our class. As a case study we provide a full characterization of Pauli maps. Our analysis leads to generalization of seminal Fujiwara-Algoet conditions for Pauli quantum channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Sylow subgroups and $0$-groups to the theory of complex algebraic supergroups, which mimic Sylow subgroups and $p$-groups in the theory of finite groups. We prove that Sylow subgroups are always $0$-groups, and show that they are unique up to conjugacy. Further, we give an explicit classification of $0$-groups which will be very useful for future applications. Finally, we prove an analogue of Sylow's third theorem on the number of Sylow subgroups of a supergroup.</description>

      <title>Post-Poisson algebras and Poisson Yang-Baxter equation via bimodule algebra deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental construction of Poisson algebras is as the quasiclassical limits (QCLs) of associative algebra deformations of commutative associative algebras. This paper extends this construction to the relative context with the notion of (bi)module algebras over another algebra for a given algebraic structure. In this language, a module Poisson algebras can be realized as the QCLs of bimodule associative deformations of module commutative associative algebras. Moreover, the notion of the scalar deformation of an $\mathcal O$-operator is introduced so that the process of bimodule algebras deformations to QCLs is endowed with $\mathcal O$-operators in a consistent manner. As an explicit illustration of this process, post-Poisson algebras are realized as the QCLs of bimodule associative deformations of module commutative associative algebras with the identity maps as $\mathcal O$-operators, recovering the known fact that post-Poisson algebras are the QCLs of tridendriform algebra deformations of commutative tridendriform algebras. Furthermore,
  the notion of scalar deformations of solutions of the associative Yang-Baxter equation (AYBE) is applied to realize solutions of the Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (PYBE) in Poisson algebras as solutions of the AYBE in commutative associative algebras, giving a YBE version of Poisson algebras as the QCLs of associative deformations of the commutative associative algebras. Finally, concrete solutions of the PYBE are obtained from the aforementioned tridendriform deformation-to-QCLs process.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>

      <title>On an inhomogeneous coagulation model with a differential sedimentation kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inhomogeneous coagulation equation that contains a transport term in the spatial variable modeling the sedimentation of clusters. We prove local existence of mass conserving solutions for a class of coagulation kernels for which in the space homogeneous case instantaneous gelation (i.e., instantaneous loss of mass) occurs. Our result holds true in particular for sum-type kernels of homogeneity greater than one, for which solutions do not exist at all in the spatially homogeneous case. Moreover, our result covers kernels that in addition vanish on the diagonal, which have been used to describe the onset of rain and the behavior of air bubbles in water.</description>

      <title>Similarities between projective quantum fields and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many homogeneous, four-dimensional space-time geometries can be considered within real projective geometry, which yields a mathematically well-defined framework for their deformations and limits without the appearance of singularities. Focussing on generalized unitary transformation behavior, projective quantum fields can be axiomatically introduced, which transform smoothly under geometry deformations and limits. Connections on the related projective frame bundles provide gauge fields with gauge group $\mathrm{PGL}_5\mathbb{R}$. For Poincar\'e geometry, on operator level only $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{GL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{GL}_3\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{R}_{\neq 0}\times \mathrm{PGL}_2\mathbb{R}\times \mathrm{PGL}_3\mathbb{R}$ gauge bosons can interact non-trivially with other projective quantum fields from the non- to ultra-relativistic limits. The corresponding propagating, complexified gauge bosons come with the Standard Model gauge group $G_{\mathrm{SM}}=(\mathrm{U}(1)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{SU}(3))/\mathbb{Z}_6$. Physical scale transformations can act as global gauge transformations and their spontaneous breaking can lead to masses for the projective quantum fields including the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge bosons. Projective quantum fields, which are irreducible both with respect to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{pgl}_5\mathbb{R}$ and the Poincar\'e group, form Dirac fermions and $G_{\mathrm{SM}}$ gauge bosons interact with them similar to the Standard Model. For homogeneous, curved Lorentz geometries a gauge group similar to the gauge group of metric-affine gravity appears.</description>

      <title>Fidelity decay and error accumulation in quantum volume circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. We devise an analytical bound to the average fidelity between the desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. We demonstrate that fidelity decays exponentially with both the number of qubits and circuit depth, and determine the decay rates as a function of the parameterized probabilities of the two types of errors. These decay constants are intricately linked to the connectivity and dimensionality of the processor's architecture. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting fidelity trends in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bethe Ansatz was discoverd in 1932. Half a century later its algebraic structure was unearthed: Yang-Baxter equation was discovered, as well as its multidimensional generalizations [tetrahedron equation and $d$-simplex equations]. Here we describe a universal method to solve these equations using Clifford algebras. The Yang-Baxter equation ($d=2$), Zamalodchikov's tetrahedron equation ($d=3$) and the Bazhanov-Stroganov equation ($d=4$) are special cases. Our solutions form a linear space. This helps us to include spectral parameters. Potential applications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mixing of open quantum systems is a fundamental problem in physics and quantum information science. Existing approaches for estimating the mixing time often rely on the spectral gap estimation of the Lindbladian generator, which can be challenging to obtain in practice. We propose a novel theoretical framework to estimate the mixing time of open quantum systems that treats the Hamiltonian and dissipative part separately, thus circumventing the need for a priori estimation of the spectral gap of the full Lindbladian generator. The technique is based on the construction of an energy functional inspired by the hypocoercivity of (classical) kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>High-order meshless global stability analysis of Taylor-Couette flows in complex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, meshless methods have become popular in numerically solving partial differential equations and have been employed to solve equations governing fluid flows, heat transfer, and species transport. In the present study, a numerical solver is developed employing the meshless framework to efficiently compute the hydrodynamic stability of fluid flows in complex geometries. The developed method is tested on two cases of Taylor-Couette flows. The concentric case represents the parallel flow assumption incorporated in the Orr-Sommerfeld model and the eccentric Taylor-Couette flow incorporates a non-parallel base flow with separation bubbles. The method was validated against earlier works by Marcus [1], Oikawa et al. [2], Leclercq et al. [3], and Mittal et al. [4]. The results for the two cases and the effectiveness of the method are discussed in detail. The method is then applied to Taylor-Couette flow in an elliptical enclosure and the stability of the flow is investigated.</description>

      <title>Modular resurgent structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of resurgence uniquely associates a factorially divergent formal power series with a collection of non-perturbative, exponential-type corrections paired with a set of complex numbers, known as Stokes constants. When the Borel plane displays a single infinite tower of singularities, the secondary resurgent series are trivial, and the Stokes constants are coefficients of an $L$-function, a rich analytic number-theoretic fabric underlies the resurgent structure of the asymptotic series. We propose a new paradigm of modular resurgence that focuses on the role of the Stokes constants and the interplay of the $q$-series acting as their generating functions with the corresponding $L$-functions. Guided by two pivotal examples arising from topological string theory and the theory of Maass cusp forms, we introduce the notion of modular resurgent series, which we conjecture to have specific summability properties as well as to be closely related to quantum modular forms.</description>

      <title>Non-linear conductances of Galton-Watson trees and application to the (near) critical random cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When considering statistical mechanics models on trees, such that the Ising model, percolation, or more generally the random cluster model, some concave tree recursions naturally emerge. Some of these recursions can be compared with non-linear conductances, or $p$-conductances, between the root and the leaves of the tree. In this article, we estimate the $p$-conductances of $T_n$, a supercritical Galton-Watson tree of depth $n$, for any $p&gt;1$ (for a quenched realization of $T_n$). In particular, we find the sharp asymptotic behavior when $n$ goes to infinity, which depends on whether the offspring distribution admits a finite moment of order $q$, where $q=\frac{p}{p-1}$ is the conjugate exponent of $p$. We then apply our results to the random cluster model on~$T_n$ (with wired boundary condition) and provide sharp estimates on the probability that the root is connected to the leaves. As an example, for the Ising model on $T_n$ with plus boundary conditions on the leaves, we find that, at criticality, the quenched magnetization of the root decays like: (i) $n^{-1/2}$ times an explicit tree-dependent constant if the offspring distribution admits a finite moment of order $3$; (ii) $n^{-1/(\alpha-1)}$ if the offspring distribution has a heavy tail with exponent $\alpha \in (1,3)$.</description>

      <title>Square root of a multivector of Clifford algebras in 3D: A game with signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.06873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algorithm to extract the square root in radicals from a multivector (MV) in real Clifford algebras Cl(p,q) for n=p+q &lt;=3 is presented. We show that in the algebras Cl(3,0), Cl(1,2) and Cl(0,3) there are up to four isolated roots in a case of the most general (generic) MV. The algebra Cl(2,1) makes up an exception and the MV here can have up to 16 isolated roots. In addition to isolated roots, a continuum of roots can appear in all algebras except p+q=1. A number of examples are provided to illustrate properties of various roots that may appear in n=3 Clifford algebras.</description>

      <title>Quenched universality for deformed Wigner matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.10200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following E. Wigner's original vision, we prove that sampling the eigenvalue gaps within the bulk spectrum of a fixed (deformed) Wigner matrix $H$ yields the celebrated Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universal statistics with high probability. Similarly, we prove universality for a monoparametric family of deformed Wigner matrices $H+xA$ with a deterministic Hermitian matrix $A$ and a fixed Wigner matrix $H$, just using the randomness of a single scalar real random variable $x$. Both results constitute quenched versions of bulk universality that has so far only been proven in annealed sense with respect to the probability space of the matrix ensemble.</description>

      <title>Stress tensor bounds on quantum fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singular behaviour of quantum fields in Minkowski space can often be bounded by polynomials of the Hamiltonian $H$. These so-called $H$-bounds and related techniques allow us to handle pointwise quantum fields and their operator product expansions in a mathematically rigorous way. A drawback of this approach, however, is that the Hamiltonian is a global rather than a local operator and, moreover, it is not defined in generic curved spacetimes. In order to overcome this drawback we investigate the possibility of replacing $H$ by a component of the stress tensor, essentially an energy density, to obtain analogous bounds. For definiteness we consider a massive, minimally coupled free Hermitean scalar field. Using novel results on distributions of positive type we show that in any globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold $M$ for any $f,F\in C_0^{\infty}(M)$ with $F\equiv 1$ on $\mathrm{supp}(f)$ and any timelike smooth vector field $t^{\mu}$ we can find constants $c,C&gt;0$ such that $\omega(\phi(f)^*\phi(f))\le C(\omega(T^{\mathrm{ren}}_{\mu\nu}(t^{\mu}t^{\nu}F^2))+c)$ for all (not necessarily quasi-free) Hadamard states $\omega$. This is essentially a new type of quantum energy inequality that entails a stress tensor bound on the smeared quantum field. In $1+1$ dimensions we also establish a bound on the pointwise quantum field, namely $|\omega(\phi(x))|\le C(\omega(T^{\mathrm{ren}}_{\mu\nu}(t^{\mu}t^{\nu}F^2))+c)$, where $F\equiv 1$ near $x$.</description>

Abstract: For a translation invariant system of $N$ bosons in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, we establish a precise bound for the ground state energy $E_N$. While the leading, order $N$, contribution to $E_N$ has been known since [30,28] and the second order corrections (of order one) have been first determined in [5], our estimate also resolves the next term in the asymptotic expansion of $E_N$, which is of the order $(\log N) / N$.</description>

Abstract: We study a two-dimensional Pauli operator describing a charged quantum particle with spin $1/2$ moving on a plane in presence of an orthogonal Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux. We classify all the admissible self-adjont realizations and give a complete picture of their spectral and scattering properties. Symmetries of the resulting Hamiltonians are also discussed, as well as their connection with the Dirac operator perturbed by an Aharonov-Bohm singularity.</description>

Abstract: Consider the genus one Hurwitz space $\mathcal{H}_1(n_0,\dots,n_m)$ of ramified covering of fixed degree with $m+1$ prescribed poles of order $n_0+1,\dots,n_m+1$, respectively. Based on a recent formula proved in \cite{Rejeb23}, we derive an explicit solution to the WDVV equations associated with the genus one Dubrovin-Hurwitz-Frobenius manifold structure induced by the normalized holomorphic differential. The obtained solution is written in terms of Bell polynomials, Eisenstein series as well as the Weierstrass functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering homogeneous four-dimensional space-time geometries within real projective geometry provides a mathematically well-defined framework to discuss their deformations and limits without the appearance of coordinate singularities. On Lie algebra level the related conjugacy limits act isomorphically to concatenations of contractions. We axiomatically introduce projective quantum fields on homogeneous space-time geometries, based on correspondingly generalized unitary transformation behavior and projectivization of the field operators. Projective correlators and their expectation values remain well-defined in all geometry limits, which includes their ultraviolet and infrared limits. They can degenerate with support on space-time boundaries and other lower-dimensional space-time subspaces. We explore fermionic and bosonic superselection sectors as well as the irreducibility of projective quantum fields. Dirac fermions appear, which obey spin-statistics as composite quantum fields. The framework systematically formalizes and generalizes the ambient space techniques regularly employed in conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we consider the asymmetric nearest neighbor ferromagnetic Ising model on the $(d+s)$-dimensional unit cubic lattice $\Z^{d+s}$, at inverse temperature $\beta=1$ and with coupling constants $J_s&gt;0$ and $J_d&gt;0$ for edges of $\Z^s$ and $\Z^d$, respectively. We obtain a lower bound for the critical curve in the phase diagram of $(J_s,J_d)$. In particular, as $J_d$ approaches its critical value from below, our result is directly related to the so-called dimensional crossover phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Deriving a GENERIC system from a Hamiltonian system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider the fundamental problem of coarse-graining infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics to obtain a macroscopic system which includes dissipative mechanisms. In particular, we study the thermodynamical implications concerning Hamiltonians, energy, and entropy and the induced geometric structures such as Poisson and Onsager brackets (symplectic and dissipative brackets).
  We start from a general finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system that is coupled linearly to an infinite-dimensional heat bath with linear dynamics. The latter is assumed to admit a compression to a finite-dimensional dissipative semigroup (i.e., the heat bath is a dilation of the semigroup) describing the dissipative evolution of new macroscopic variables.
  Already in the finite-energy case (zero-temperature heat bath) we obtain the so-called GENERIC structure (General Equations for Non-Equilibrium Reversible Irreversibe Coupling), with conserved energy, nondecreasing entropy, a new Poisson structure, and an Onsager operator describing the dissipation. However, their origin is not obvious at this stage. After extending the system in a natural way to the case of positive temperature, giving a heat bath with infinite energy, the compression property leads to an exact multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that drives the rest of the system. Thus, we are able to identify a conserved energy, an entropy, and an Onsager operator (involving the Green-Kubo formalism) which indeed provide a GENERIC structure for the macroscopic system.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study (static) solutions of the rank 2 Yang-Mills-Higgs equations on the Riemann sphere, with concical singularities, that bifurcate from constant curvature connections. We focus attention on the case where there are exactly four such singularities. This study brings together ideas from the gauge theory of constant curvature connections on vector bundles over singular Riemann surfaces with the Riemann-Hilbert analysis of classical Fuchsian ODEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16754v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kinetic equation is crucial for understanding the statistical properties of stochastic processes, yet current equations, such as the classical Fokker-Planck, are limited to local analysis. This paper derives a new kinetic equation for stochastic systems on vector bundles, addressing global scale randomness. The kinetic equation was derived by cumulant expansion of the ensemble-averaged local probability density function, which is a functional of state transition trajectories. The kinetic equation is the geodesic equation for the probability space. It captures global and historical influences, accounts for non-Markovianity, and can be reduced to the classical Fokker-Planck equation for Markovian processes. This paper also discusses relative issues concerning the kinetic equation, including non-Markovianity, Markov approximation, macroscopic conservation equations, gauge transformation, and truncation of the infinite-order kinetic equation, as well as limitations that require further attention.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we obtain the precise range of the values of the parameter $\alpha$ such that Petz-R\'enyi $\alpha$-relative entropy $D_{\alpha}(\rho||\sigma)$ of two displaced thermal states is finite. More precisely, we prove that, given two displaced thermal states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ with inverse temperature parameters $r_1, r_2,\dots, r_n$ and $s_1,s_2, \dots, s_n$, respectively, we have
  \[
  D_{\alpha}(\rho||\sigma)&lt;\infty \Leftrightarrow \alpha &lt; \min \left\{ \frac{s_j}{s_j-r_j}: j \in \{ 1, \ldots , n \} \text{ such that } r_j&lt;s_j \right\},
  \]
where we adopt the convention that the minimum of an empty set is equal to infinity. Along the way, we prove a special case of a conjecture of Seshdreesan, Lami and Wilde (J. Math. Phys. 59, 072204 (2018)).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that linear superpositions of plane waves involving a single-valued, covariantly stable dispersion relation $\omega(k)$ always propagate outside the lightcone, unless $\omega(k) =a+b k$. This implies that there is no notion of causality for individual dispersion relations, since no mathematical condition on the function $\omega(k)$ (such as the front velocity or the asymptotic group velocity conditions) can serve as a sufficient condition for subluminal propagation in dispersive media. Instead, causality can only emerge from a careful cancellation that occurs when one superimposes all the excitation branches of a physical model. This is shown to happen automatically in local theories of matter that are covariantly stable. Hence, we find that the need for nonhydrodynamic modes in relativistic fluid mechanics is analogous to the need for antiparticles in relativistic quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Logic gates can be written in terms of complex differential operators where the inputs and outputs are analytic functions with several variables. Using the polar representation of complex numbers, we arrive at an immediate connection between the oscillatory behavior of the system and logic gates. We explain the universal programming language (UPL) used by physical objects to process information. To assure the causality structure in UPL, we introduce the concept of layers that characterizes the computations for each time scale.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the self-adjointness in $L^2$-setting of the operators acting as $-\nabla\cdot h\nabla$, with piecewise constant functions $h$ having a jump along a Lipschitz hypersurface $\Sigma$, without explicit assumptions on the sign of $h$. We establish a number of sufficient conditions for the self-adjointness of the operator with $H^s$-regularity for suitable $s\in[1,\frac{3}{2}]$, in terms of the jump value and the regularity and geometric properties of $\Sigma$. An important intermediate step is a link with Fredholm properties of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator on $\Sigma$, which is new for the Lipschitz setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The connection between absorbing boundary conditions and hard walls is well established in the mathematical literature for a variety of stochastic models, including for instance the Brownian motion. In this paper we explore this duality for a different type of process which is of particular interest in physics and biology, namely the run-tumble-particle, a toy model of active particle. For a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary external force, we provide a duality relation between the exit probability, i.e. the probability that the particle exits an interval from a given boundary before a certain time $t$, and the cumulative distribution of its position in the presence of hard walls at the same time $t$. We show this relation for a run-and-tumble particle in the stationary state by explicitly computing both quantities. At finite time, we provide a derivation using the Fokker-Planck equation. All the results are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Computational modelling of complex multiphase behavior of environmentally-friendly materials for sustainable technological solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a computational framework to investigate and predict the complicated multiphase properties of eco-friendly lead-free piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for sustainable technological progress. Although their electromechanical properties vary by phase, lead-free piezoelectric materials show a considerable thermo-electromechanical response. Lead-free materials such as Bi$_{0.5}$Na$_{0,5}$TiO$_{3}$ (BNT) and other BNT-type piezoelectric materials transition to rhombohedral (R3c), orthorhombic (Pnma), tetragonal (P4bm), and cubic (Cc) phases with temperature variation. These phases are determined by the symmetry and alignment of the ferroelectric domains. Multiple phases can occur simultaneously under specific thermal, electrical, and mechanical conditions, leading in complex multiphase behaviour. These materials' performance must be assessed by studying such behaviour. This study uses Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory to simulate material micro-domain phase transitions. The computational model for BNT-type piezoelectric material covers temperature-induced ferroelectric domain switching and phase transitions. Therefore, the developed computational approach will assist us in better understanding the influence of these materials' complex multiphase behaviour on creating sustainable solutions with green technologies.</description>

      <title>Free fermions, neutrality and modular transformations</title>

Abstract: With a view towards higher-spin applications, we study the partition function of a free complex fermion in 2d CFT, restricted to the neutral (zero fermion number) sector. This restriction leads to a partial theta function with a combinatoric interpretation in terms of Dyson's crank of a partition. More crucially, this partition function can be expressed in terms of a q-hypergeometric function with quantum modular properties. This allows us to find its high-temperature asymptotics, including subleading terms which agree with, but also go beyond, what one obtains by imposing neutrality thermodynamically through a chemical potential. We evaluate the asymptotic density of states for this neutral partition function, including the first few subleading terms. Our results should be extendable to more fermions, as well as to higher-spin chemical potentials, which would be of relevance to the higher-spin/minimal model correspondence.</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02940</link>

Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if it is the past endpoint of causal curves in spacetime. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [1], and Goswami and Joshi [2], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [1] and [2]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [3] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC then gives a sufficient condition ensuring that the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, are of strong curvature type and hence correspond to the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [4] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>
