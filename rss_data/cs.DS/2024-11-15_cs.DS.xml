      <title>Sublinear Metric Steiner Tree via Improved Bounds for Set Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the metric Steiner tree problem in the sublinear query model. In this problem, for a set of $n$ points $V$ in a metric space given to us by means of query access to an $n\times n$ matrix $w$, and a set of terminals $T\subseteq V$, the goal is to find the minimum-weight subset of the edges that connects all the terminal vertices.
  Recently, Chen, Khanna and Tan [SODA'23] gave an algorithm that uses $\widetilde{O}(n^{13/7})$ queries and outputs a $(2-\eta)$-estimate of the metric Steiner tree weight, where $\eta&gt;0$ is a universal constant. A key component in their algorithm is a sublinear algorithm for a particular set cover problem where, given a set system $(U, F)$, the goal is to provide a multiplicative-additive estimate for $|U|-\textsf{SC}(U, F)$. Here $U$ is the set of elements, $F$ is the collection of sets, and $\textsf{SC}(U, F)$ denotes the optimal set cover size of $(U, F)$. In particular, their algorithm returns a $(1/4, \varepsilon\cdot|U|)$-multiplicative-additive estimate for this set cover problem using $\widetilde{O}(|F|^{7/4})$ membership oracle queries (querying whether a set $S$ contains an $e$), where $\varepsilon$ is a fixed constant.
  In this work, we improve the query complexity of $(2-\eta)$-estimating the metric Steiner tree weight to $\widetilde{O}(n^{5/3})$ by showing a $(1/2, \varepsilon \cdot |U|)$-estimate for the above set cover problem using $\widetilde{O}(|F|^{5/3})$ membership queries. To design our set cover algorithm, we estimate the size of a random greedy maximal matching for an auxiliary multigraph that the algorithm constructs implicitly, without access to its adjacency list or matrix.</description>

      <title>Comparative genomics with succinct colored de Bruijn graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA technologies have evolved significantly in the past years enabling the sequencing of a large number of genomes in a short time. Nevertheless, the underlying computational problem is hard, and many technical factors and limitations complicate obtaining the complete sequence of a genome. Many genomes are left in a draft state, in which each chromosome is represented by a set of sequences with partial information on their relative order. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to compare draft genomes by comparing paths in de Bruijn graphs, which are constructed by many practical genome assemblers. In this article we introduce gcBB, a method for comparing genomes represented as succinct colored de Bruijn graphs directly, without resorting to sequence alignments, by means of the entropy and expectation measures based on the Burrows-Wheeler Similarity Distribution. We also introduce an improved version of gcBB, called mgcBB, that improves the time performance considerably through the selection of different data structures. We have compared phylogenies of genomes obtained by other methods to those obtained with gcBB, achieving promising results.</description>

      <title>FlexFlood: Efficiently Updatable Learned Multi-dimensional Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A learned multi-dimensional index is a data structure that efficiently answers multi-dimensional orthogonal queries by understanding the data distribution using machine learning models. One of the existing problems is that the search performance significantly decreases when the distribution of data stored in the data structure becomes skewed due to update operations. To overcome this problem, we propose FlexFlood, a flexible variant of Flood. FlexFlood partially reconstructs the internal structure when the data distribution becomes skewed. Moreover, FlexFlood is the first learned multi-dimensional index that guarantees the time complexity of the update operation. Through experiments using both artificial and real-world data, we demonstrate that the search performance when the data distribution becomes skewed is up to 10 times faster than existing methods. We also found that partial reconstruction takes only about twice as much time as naive data updating.</description>

      <title>Pkd-tree: Parallel $k$d-tree with Batch Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$d-tree is one of the most widely used data structures to manage multi-dimensional data. Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative to consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in existing parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.
  The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by supporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree (Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and in practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update (insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor search, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong theoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism), and cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction algorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and 2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be weight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering effort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.
  We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including both uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with state-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better or competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and updates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for the Longest Common Subsequence and Substring Problem for Multiple Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_s$ and $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_t$ be strings over an alphabet $\Sigma$, where $s$ and $t$ are positive integers. The longest common subsequence and substring problem for multiple strings $X_1, X_2, ..., X_s$ and $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_t$ is to find the longest string which is a subsequence of $X_1, X_2, ..., X_s$ and a substring of $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_t$. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to solve the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since AVL trees were invented in 1962, two major open questions about rebalancing operations, which found positive answers in other balanced binary search trees, were left open: can these operations be performed top-down (with a fixed look-ahead), and can they use an amortised constant number of write operations per update? We propose an algorithm that answers both questions positively.</description>

      <title>Designing Automated Market Makers for Combinatorial Securities: A Geometric Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing automated market makers (AMMs) for prediction markets on combinatorial securities over large outcome spaces poses significant computational challenges. Prior research has primarily focused on combinatorial prediction markets within specific set systems (e.g., intervals, permutations). We introduce a framework for designing AMMs on arbitrary set systems by building a novel connection to the range query problem in computational geometry. This connection enables the analysis of computational complexity and the design of efficient AMMs.
  We first demonstrate the equivalence between price queries and trade updates under the popular combinatorial logarithmic market scoring rule market and the range query and range update problem. Building on this equivalence, we construct sublinear time algorithms when the VC dimension of the set system is bounded and show the non-existence of such algorithms for unbounded VC dimension cases. We then extend this approach to AMMs for combinatorial prediction markets with quadratic and power scoring rules. Finally, we show that the multi-resolution market design can be naturally integrated into the partition-tree scheme.
  Additionally, we introduce the combinatorial swap operation problem for automated market makers in decentralized finance and show that it can be efficiently reduced to range update problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop algorithms for the optimization of convex objectives that have H\"older continuous $q$-th derivatives with respect to a $p$-norm by using a $q$-th order oracle, for $p, q \geq 1$. We can also optimize other structured functions. We do this by developing a non-Euclidean inexact accelerated proximal point method that makes use of an inexact uniformly convex regularizer. We also provide nearly matching lower bounds for any deterministic algorithm that interacts with the function via a local oracle.</description>

      <title>Nearly Tight Bounds on Testing of Metric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a non-negative $n \times n$ matrix viewed as a set of distances between $n$ points, we consider the property testing problem of deciding if it is a metric. We also consider the same problem for two special classes of metrics, tree metrics and ultrametrics. For general metrics, our paper is the first to consider these questions. We prove an upper bound of $O(n^{2/3}/\epsilon^{4/3})$ on the query complexity for this problem. Our algorithm is simple, but the analysis requires great care in bounding the variance on the number of violating triangles in a sample. When $\epsilon$ is a slowly decreasing function of $n$ (rather than a constant, as is standard), we prove a lower bound of matching dependence on $n$ of $\Omega (n^{2/3})$, ruling out any property testers with $o(n^{2/3})$ query complexity unless their dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is super-polynomial.
  Next, we turn to tree metrics and ultrametrics. While there were known upper and lower bounds, we considerably improve these bounds showing essentially tight bounds of $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon )$ on the sample complexity. We also show a lower bound of $\Omega ( 1/\epsilon^{4/3} )$ on the query complexity. Our upper bounds are derived by doing a more careful analysis of a natural, simple algorithm. For the lower bounds, we construct distributions on NO instances, where it is hard to find a witness showing that these are not ultrametrics.</description>

      <title>Weak Poincar\'e Inequalities, Simulated Annealing, and Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of powerful tools to show rapid mixing of Markov chains, via functional inequalities such as Poincar\'e inequalities. In many situations, Markov chains fail to mix rapidly from a worst-case initialization, yet are expected to approximately sample from a random initialization. For example, this occurs if the target distribution has metastable states, small clusters accounting for a vanishing fraction of the mass that are essentially disconnected from the bulk of the measure. Under such conditions, a Poincar\'e inequality cannot hold, necessitating new tools to prove sampling guarantees. We develop a framework to analyze simulated annealing, based on establishing so-called weak Poincar\'e inequalities. These inequalities imply mixing from a suitably warm start, and simulated annealing provides a way to chain such warm starts together into a sampling algorithm. We further identify a local-to-global principle to prove weak Poincar\'e inequalities, mirroring the spectral independence and localization schemes frameworks for analyzing mixing times of Markov chains.
  As our main application, we prove that simulated annealing samples from the Gibbs measure of a spherical spin glass for inverse temperatures up to a natural threshold, matching recent algorithms based on algorithmic stochastic localization. This provides the first Markov chain sampling guarantee that holds beyond the uniqueness threshold for spherical spin glasses, where mixing from a worst-case initialization is provably slow. As an ingredient in our proof, we prove bounds on the operator norm of the covariance matrix of spherical spin glasses in the full replica-symmetric regime.
  Additionally, we resolve questions related to the mixing of Glauber dynamics in the ferromagnetic Potts model from a uniform monochromatic coloring, and sampling using data-based initializations.</description>

      <title>Efficiently learning and sampling multimodal distributions with data-based initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a multimodal distribution with a Markov chain given a small number of samples from the stationary measure. Although mixing can be arbitrarily slow, we show that if the Markov chain has a $k$th order spectral gap, initialization from a set of $\tilde O(k/\varepsilon^2)$ samples from the stationary distribution will, with high probability over the samples, efficiently generate a sample whose conditional law is $\varepsilon$-close in TV distance to the stationary measure. In particular, this applies to mixtures of $k$ distributions satisfying a Poincar\'e inequality, with faster convergence when they satisfy a log-Sobolev inequality. Our bounds are stable to perturbations to the Markov chain, and in particular work for Langevin diffusion over $\mathbb R^d$ with score estimation error, as well as Glauber dynamics combined with approximation error from pseudolikelihood estimation. This justifies the success of data-based initialization for score matching methods despite slow mixing for the data distribution, and improves and generalizes the results of Koehler and Vuong (2023) to have linear, rather than exponential, dependence on $k$ and apply to arbitrary semigroups. As a consequence of our results, we show for the first time that a natural class of low-complexity Ising measures can be efficiently learned from samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) is vital in viral marketing and biological network analysis for identifying key influencers. Given its NP-hard nature, approximate solutions are employed. This paper addresses scalability challenges in scale-out shared memory system by focusing on the state-of-the-art Influence Maximization via Martingales (IMM) benchmark. To enhance the work efficiency of the current IMM implementation, we propose EFFICIENTIMM with key strategies, including new parallelization scheme, NUMA-aware memory usage, dynamic load balancing and fine-grained adaptive data structures. Benchmarking on a 128-core CPU system with 8 NUMA nodes, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving an average 5.9x speedup over Ripples across 8 diverse SNAP datasets, when compared to the best execution times of the original Ripples framework. Additionally, on the Youtube graph, EFFICIENTIMM demonstrates a better memory access pattern with 357.4x reduction in L1+L2 cache misses as compared to Ripples.</description>

      <title>On the Limits of Language Generation: Trade-Offs Between Hallucination and Mode Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specifying all desirable properties of a language model is challenging, but certain requirements seem essential. Given samples from an unknown language, the trained model should produce valid strings not seen in training and be expressive enough to capture the language's full richness. Otherwise, outputting invalid strings constitutes "hallucination," and failing to capture the full range leads to "mode collapse." We ask if a language model can meet both requirements.
  We investigate this within a statistical language generation setting building on Gold and Angluin. Here, the model receives random samples from a distribution over an unknown language K, which belongs to a possibly infinite collection of languages. The goal is to generate unseen strings from K. We say the model generates from K with consistency and breadth if, as training size increases, its output converges to all unseen strings in K.
  Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] asked if consistency and breadth in language generation are possible. We answer this negatively: for a large class of language models, including next-token prediction models, this is impossible for most collections of candidate languages. This contrasts with [KM24]'s result, showing consistent generation without breadth is possible for any countable collection of languages. Our finding highlights that generation with breadth fundamentally differs from generation without breadth.
  As a byproduct, we establish near-tight bounds on the number of samples needed for generation with or without breadth.
  Finally, our results offer hope: consistent generation with breadth is achievable for any countable collection of languages when negative examples (strings outside K) are available alongside positive ones. This suggests that post-training feedback, which encodes negative examples, can be crucial in reducing hallucinations while limiting mode collapse.</description>

      <title>Simpler and Unified Recognition Algorithm for Path Graphs and Directed Path Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.08476v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A path graph is the intersection graph of paths in a tree. A directed path graph is the intersection graph of paths in a directed tree. Even if path graphs and directed path graphs are characterized very similarly, their recognition algorithms differ widely. We further unify these two graph classes by presenting the first recognition algorithm for both path graphs and directed path graphs. We deeply use a recent characterization of path graphs, and we extend it to directed path graphs. Our algorithm does not require complex data structures and has an easy and intuitive implementation, simplifying recognition algorithms for both graph classes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problems of enumerating minimal vertex covers and minimal dominating sets with capacity and/or connectivity constraints. We develop polynomial-delay enumeration algorithms for these problems on bounded-degree graphs. For the case of minimal connected vertex covers, our algorithms run in polynomial delay even on the class of $d$-claw free graphs, extending the result on bounded-degree graphs, and in output quasi-polynomial time on general graphs. To complement these algorithmic results, we show that the problems of enumerating minimal connected vertex covers, minimal connected dominating sets, and minimal capacitated vertex covers in $2$-degenerated bipartite graphs are at least as hard as enumerating minimal transversals in hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>E-Graphs as Circuits, and Optimal Extraction via Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new connection between e-graphs and Boolean circuits. This allows us to adapt existing literature on circuits to easily arrive at an algorithm for optimal e-graph extraction, parameterized by treewidth, which runs in $2^{O(w^2)}\text{poly}(w, n)$ time, where $w$ is the treewidth of the e-graph. Additionally, we show how the circuit view of e-graphs allows us to apply powerful simplification techniques, and we analyze a dataset of e-graphs to show that these techniques can reduce e-graph size and treewidth by 40-80% in many cases. While the core parameterized algorithm may be adapted to work directly on e-graphs, the primary value of the circuit view is in allowing the transfer of ideas from the well-established field of circuits to e-graphs.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Speed-Up for Approximating the Top Eigenvectors of a Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding a good approximation of the top eigenvector of a given $d\times d$ matrix $A$ is a basic and important computational problem, with many applications. We give two different quantum algorithms that, given query access to the entries of a Hermitian matrix $A$ and assuming a constant eigenvalue gap, output a classical description of a good approximation of the top eigenvector: one algorithm with time complexity $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(d^{1.75})$ and one with time complexity $d^{1.5+o(1)}$ (the first algorithm has a slightly better dependence on the $\ell_2$-error of the approximating vector than the second, and uses different techniques of independent interest). Both of our quantum algorithms provide a polynomial speed-up over the best-possible classical algorithm, which needs $\Omega(d^2)$ queries to entries of $A$, and hence $\Omega(d^2)$ time. We extend this to a quantum algorithm that outputs a classical description of the subspace spanned by the top-$q$ eigenvectors in time $qd^{1.5+o(1)}$. We also prove a nearly-optimal lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1.5})$ on the quantum query complexity of approximating the top eigenvector.
  Our quantum algorithms run a version of the classical power method that is robust to certain benign kinds of errors, where we implement each matrix-vector multiplication with small and well-behaved error on a quantum computer, in different ways for the two algorithms. Our first algorithm estimates the matrix-vector product one entry at a time, using a new "Gaussian phase estimation" procedure. Our second algorithm uses block-encoding techniques to compute the matrix-vector product as a quantum state, from which we obtain a classical description by a new time-efficient unbiased pure-state tomography procedure.</description>
