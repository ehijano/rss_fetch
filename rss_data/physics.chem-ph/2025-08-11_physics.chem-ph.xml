      <title>Low temperature jet spectra of (DFE)2, DFE-He, DFE-He2 and DFE in the 2210-3105 cm-1 region (DFE = 1,1 difluoroethylene)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pulsed supersonic slit jet expansion of a dilute mixture of 1,1 difluoroethylene (DFE) in helium is probed using a tunable infrared source to obtain spectra of (DFE)2, DFE-He, and DFE-He2. The DFE dimer is found to have a slipped antiparallel structure with two-fold rotational symmetry and little or no dipole moment (explaining why no pure rotational spectrum has been observed). The separation of the monomer centers of mass is 3.44 {\AA}. The spectra of DFE-He show line splittings due to tunneling of the He atom from one side of the DFE plane to the other. Rotational analysis of the DFE-He tunneling components in terms of a conventional asymmetric rotor yields small systematic errors due to the presence of large amplitude motions. A relatively weak spectrum is analyzed for one band of DFE-He2, whose structure places the two He atoms in equivalent positions on each side of DFE, very close to the location of He in DFE-He. Extensive spectra of DFE monomer were also obtained while searching for the cluster bands. A total of 23 bands from 2210 to 3105 cm-1 were observed. These are the first such high resolution results in this region, and they are of special interest because DFE has been a prototype for the study of vibrational anharmonicity and resonances</description>

      <title>Response Theory for Static and Dynamic Solvation of Ionic and Dipolar Solutes in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of polar solvents to ions and polar molecules dictates many fundamental molecular processes. To understand such electrostatically-driven solvation processes, one ideally would probe the dielectric response of a solvent to an idealized point test charge or dipole solute, as envisioned in classic continuum treatments of the problem. However, this is difficult in simulations using standard atomically-detailed solvent models with embedded point charges due to possible overlap with the test charge that lead to singular interaction energies. This problem is traditionally avoided for a realistic charged solute by introducing an excluded volume core that shields its embedded point charge or dipole from the charges in the solvent. However, this core introduces additional molecular-scale perturbations of the solvent density that complicate the interpretation of solvent dielectric response. In this work, we avoid these complications through the use of Gaussian-smoothed test charges and dipoles. Gaussian charges and dipoles can be readily inserted anywhere into an atomistic solvent model without encountering infinite energies. If the Gaussian-smoothing is on the scale of molecular correlations in the solvent, both the thermodynamic and dynamic solvation response is linear. Using this observation, we construct accurate predictive theories for solvation free energies and solvation dynamics for insertion of Gaussian charges and dipoles in polar solvents and demonstrate the accuracy of the theories for a widely-used model of water. Our results suggest that Gaussian test charge distributions can be used as an informative probe of dielectric response in molecular models, and our theories can be used to analytically predict the largest component of solvation free energies of charged and polar solutes.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Angular Momentum Generation in Thermally Driven Chiral Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of angular momentum in the nuclear motion of molecular systems lacking inversion symmetry under imposed thermal gradients presents a novel mechanism with potential implications for spintronics, magnetic response, and energy transport in such systems. Here we explore this phenomenon, using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study angular momentum generation in several driven chiral molecular models. We demonstrate that significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such systems.</description>

      <title>Depth-Resolved Vibrational SFG/DFG Spectroscopy of the Anisotropic Water Structure at Charged Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular structure of water at charged aqueous interfaces is shaped by interfacial electric fields, which can induce significant anisotropy in the molecular orientations that extends over nanometer-scale distances. Despite great relevance, very little is known about the details of this depth-dependent anisotropic water structure, mainly due to the lack of appropriate experimental techniques. Here, we present a time-domain spectrometer specifically developed to acquire depth-resolved nonlinear vibrational spectra at aqueous interfaces. The approach is based on combining phase-resolved vibrational sum- and difference-frequency spectra and enables the extraction of depth information on the nanometer scale. The analysis of the acquired resonant spectral line shapes meanwhile yields insight into local hydrogen-bond structures and anisotropic molecular orientations across the interfacial region. In measurements with insoluble charged surfactants, we demonstrate that the obtained data allows for a full reconstruction of the nonlinear vibrational responses as function of depth. The results show the presence of two pronounced regions within the interfacial anisotropy with largely deviating degrees of preferential molecular orientations. A spectral analysis of the depth-dependent vibrational responses furthermore reveals that the natural local hydrogen-bond structure of bulk water remains intact throughout the interfacial region, including water in the direct proximity of the surface charges. These findings significantly refine our understanding of the anisotropic water structure at the interface to charged surfactants and showcase the large potential of our depth-resolved spectroscopic technique.</description>

      <title>Reduced density matrix and cumulant approximations of quantum linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear response (LR) is an important tool in the computational chemist's toolbox. It is therefore no surprise that the emergence of quantum computers has led to a quantum version, quantum LR (qLR). However, the current quantum era of near-term intermediary scale quantum (NISQ) computers is dominated by noise, short decoherence times, and slow measurement speed. It is therefore of interest to find approximations that greatly reduce the quantum workload while only slightly impacting the quality of a method. In an effort to achieve this, we approximate the naive qLR with singles and doubles (qLRSD) method by either directly approximating the reduced density matrices (RDMs) or indirectly through their respective reduced density cumulants (RDCs). We present an analysis of the measurement costs behind qLR with RDMs, and report qLR results for model Hydrogen ladder systems; for varying active space sizes of OCS, SeH$_2$, and H$_2$S; and for symmetrically stretched H$_2$O and BeH$_2$.
  Discouragingly, while approximations to the 4-body RDMs and RDCs seem to produce good results for systems at the equilibrium geometry and for some types of core excitations, they both tend to fail when the system exhibits strong correlation. All approximations to the 3-body RDMs and/or RDCs severely affect the results and cannot be applied.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann Thermometry at Cryogenic Temperatures Exploiting Stark Sublevels in Er$^{3+}$/Yb$^{3+}$-Codoped Yttrium Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of reliable luminescent nanothermometers for cryogenic applications is essential for advancing quantum technologies, superconducting systems, and other fields that require precise, high-spatial-resolution temperature monitoring. Lanthanide-doped systems are vastly employed to this purpose, and typically perform optimally at or above room temperature when manifold-to-manifold transitions are used. In this work we exploit individual Stark sublevels to demonstrate an optical thermometer based on Er$^{3+}$/Yb$^{3+}$ codoped yttria (Y$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles that operates effectively across the temperature range from 25 K to 175 K. This is achieved due to the pronounced crystal field environment of the the Y$_2$O$_3$ host matrix, leading to well-separated Stark lines in the luminescence spectrum of the Er$^{3+}$ ions. By applying the Luminescence Intensity Ratio (LIR) method to transitions originating from two Stark components of the $^4$S$_{3/2}$ manifold of the Er$^{3+}$ ions, we achieve thermal sensitivities up to 1.25 % K$^{-1}$ at 100 K and temperature resolutions reaching 0.2 K. Our results further experimentally confirm recently published theoretical predictions, demonstrating that thermometric performance is not directly dependent on the average (barycenter) difference of the involved electronic energy levels when using individual Stark transitions to evaluate the LIR. The proposed procedure gives an energy gap calibration that matches the one determined by sample spectroscopy for non-overlapping lines in the luminescence spectrum. These insights provide a robust foundation for the design of high-performance cryogenic thermometers based on rare-earth-doped materials.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Reaction Coordinate Optimization with Histories: A Framework for Rare Event Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding, chemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate phenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics. Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general, flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and longitudinal datasets.</description>

      <title>O1NumHess: a fast and accurate seminumerical Hessian algorithm using only O(1) gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe a new algorithm, O1NumHess, to calculate the Hessian of a molecular system by finite differentiation of gradients calculated at displaced geometries. Different from the conventional seminumerical Hessian algorithm, which requires gradients at $O(N_{\mathrm{atom}})$ displaced geometries (where $N_{\mathrm{atom}}$ is the number of atoms), the present approach only requires $O(1)$ gradients. Key to the reduction of the number of gradients is the exploitation of the off-diagonal low-rank (ODLR) property of Hessians, namely the blocks of the Hessian that correspond to two distant groups of atoms have low rank. This property reduces the number of independent entries of the Hessian from $O(N_{\mathrm{atom}}^2)$ to $O(N_{\mathrm{atom}})$, such that $O(1)$ gradients already contain enough information to uniquely determine the Hessian. Numerical results on model systems (long alkanes and polyenes), transition metal reactions (WCCR10) and non-covalent complexes (S30L-CI) using the BDF program show that O1NumHess gives frequency, zero-point energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy errors that are only about two times those of conventional double-sided seminumerical Hessians. Moreover, O1NumHess is always faster than the conventional numerical Hessian algorithm, frequently even faster than the analytic Hessian, and requires only about 100 gradients for sufficiently large systems. An open-source implementation of this method, which can also be applied to problems irrelevant to computational chemistry, is available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: The connect-fill-run workflow paradigm, widely adopted in mature software engineering, accelerates collaborative development. However, computational chemistry, computational materials science, and computational biology face persistent demands for multi-scale simulations constrained by simplistic platform designs. We present MiqroForge, an intelligent cross-scale platform integrating quantum computing capabilities. By combining AI-driven dynamic resource scheduling with an intuitive visual interface, MiqroForge significantly lowers entry barriers while optimizing computational efficiency. The platform fosters a collaborative ecosystem through shared node libraries and data repositories, thereby bridging practitioners across classical and quantum computational domains.</description>

      <title>OH$^-$-Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction at the Au(111) Electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media suffers from sluggish kinetics but the origin of the pH-dependent activity remains debated. This study investigates the role of hydroxide ions (OH) in enhancing the alkaline HER at Au(111) by systematically varying the pH and the NaOH concentration both with and without fixing the total Na concentration.Contrary to conventional cation-centric models of alkaline HER, we demonstrate a notable anion effect by showing that the HER activity increases monotonically with pH and OH concentration, even at extremely high NaOH concentrations(up to 9 M).Tafel slopes decrease from 181 mV/dec at pH=10 to 124 mV/dec at pH=13 and to 111 mV/dec for the case with 9 M NaOH, indicating accelerated kinetics.Infrared spectroscopy reveals that interfacial OH strengthens the hydrogen-bond network, which is expected to lower the activation energy for the Volmer step,the rate-determining step of HER on Au(111). Hence,OH enhances alkaline HER kinetics by strengthening the hydrogen bond network and its connectivity at the electrochemical interface;this allows us to propose a unified mechanism for the electrolyte effects on alkaline HER where structure-making ions (Li,K,and OH) improve the reaction kinetics by optimizing the interfacial hydrogen bond network.</description>

      <title>Coulombic control of charge transfer in luminescent radicals with long-lived quartet states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in organic materials are emerging as an attractive platform for tunable quantum technologies. Structures with near-degenerate doublet and triplet excitations in linked trityl radical, acene and carbazole units can host quartet states. These high spin states can be coherently manipulated, and later decay radiatively via the radical doublet transition. However, this requires controlling the deexcitation pathways of all metastable states. Here we establish design rules for efficient quartet generation in luminescent radicals, using different connection arrangements of the molecular units. We discover that electronic coupling strength between these units dictates luminescence and quartet formation yields, particularly through the energetics of an acene-radical charge transfer state, which we tune Coulombically. This state acts as a source of non-radiative decay when acene-radical separation is small, but facilitates doublet-quartet spin interconversion when acene-radical separation is large. Using these rules we report a radical-carbazole-acene material with 55% luminescence yield, where 94% of emitting excitons originate from the quartet at microsecond times. This reveals the central role of molecular topology in luminescent quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the geometric structure and multiple timescales of the urea-urease pH oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-variable dynamical system modeling pH oscillations in the urea-urease reaction within giant lipid vesicles -- a problem that intrinsically contains multiple, well-separated timescales. Building on an existing, deterministic formulation via ordinary differential equations, we resolve different orders of magnitude within a small parameter and analyze the system's limit cycle behavior using geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). By introducing two different coordinate scalings -- each valid in a distinct region of the phase space -- we resolve the local dynamics near critical fold points, using the extension of GSPT through such singular points due to Krupa and Szmolyan. This framework enables a geometric decomposition of the periodic orbits into slow and fast segments and yields closed-form estimates for the period of oscillation. In particular, we link the existence of such oscillations to an underlying biochemical asymmetry, namely, the differential transport across the vesicle membrane.</description>

      <title>PHIP Sequences and Dipolar Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) achieves efficient hyperpolarisation of nuclear spins with the transfer of the singlet order of parahydrogen to target molecules through catalytic hydrogenation reactions and subsequent coherent control of the spin dynamics. However, in realistic conditions B0/B1 inhomogeneities lead to significant reduction in the polarization transfer efficiency. Moreover, in high-concentration samples, dipolar fields arising from the magnetisation of the sample can degrade polarisation transfer efficiency significantly. In this work, we present a theoretical framework and a comprehensive analysis of both pulsed and continuous-wave (CW) control sequences designed to mitigate the detrimental effects of dipolar fields, $B_0/B_1$ inhomogeneities, and moderate chemical shifts. By combining tools from average Hamiltonian theory with detailed numerical simulations, we introduce and characterise a wide range of transfer sequences, including dipolar-field adjusted and dipolar-field suppressing protocols. We identify conditions under which dipolar interactions either hinder or, perhaps surprisingly, stabilise polarization transfer, depending on the sequence structure. Our results offer practical guidance for the selection and design of PHIP transfer sequences under realistic experimental constraints and open pathways toward robust hyperpolarisation in concentrated liquid-state NMR samples.</description>

Abstract: We extend a previous result [Sutter et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 475202 (2024)] to give an explicit form of the set of $v$-representable densities on the one-dimensional torus with any fixed number of particles in contact with a heat bath at finite temperature. The particle interaction has to satisfy some mild assumptions but is kept entirely general otherwise. For densities, we consider the Sobolev space $H^1$ and exploit the convexity of the functionals. This leads to a broader set of potentials than the usual $L^p$ spaces and encompasses distributions. By including temperature and thus considering all excited states in the Gibbs ensemble, G\^ateaux differentiability of the thermal universal functional is guaranteed. This yields $v$-representability and it is demonstrated that the given set of $v$-representable densities is even maximal.</description>

      <title>Multiple Adsorption of CO Molecules on Transition Metal Substitutional Impurities in Copper Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Copper-based catalysts are of particular interest for electrochemical reduction of CO$_2$ (CO2RR) as products beyond CO can form. To improve activity and selectivity, several studies have focused on the addition of other elements as substitutional impurities. Although the adsorption of a single CO molecule has often been used as a descriptor for CO2RR activity, our recent calculations using the RPBE functional showed that multiple CO molecules can bind to first-row transition metal impurities. Here, we extend the study to second-row transition metals and also to a functional that explicitly includes dispersion interaction, BEEF-vdW. The binding energy of the first CO molecule on the impurity atom is found to be significantly larger than on the clean Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces, but the differential binding energy generally drops as more CO molecules adsorb. The dispersion interaction is found to make a significant contribution to the binding energy, in particular for the last and weakest bound CO molecule, the one that is most likely to participate in CO2RR. In some cases, four CO admolecules can bind more strongly on the impurity atom than on the clean copper surface. The adsorption of CO causes the position of the impurity atom to shift outwards and in some cases, even escape from the surface layer. The C-O stretch frequencies are calculated in order to identify possible experimental signatures of multiple CO adsorption.</description>

Abstract: RaOCH$_3$ molecule is one of the most sensitive systems for the electron electric dipole moment ($e$EDM) searches. Its hyperfine and $K-$doubling structure in the external electric field is of key importance for preparing and interpreting the experiment. We propose the method for calculation the symmetric top molecules and applied it for RaOCH$_3$. Hyperfine structure, $K-$doubling and sensitivity of the molecule to $e$EDM in the external electric field were calculated.</description>

      <title>Drag Coefficient in Near-Critical Binary Mixtures: Solving Hydrodynamic Fields with Improved Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the drag coefficient of a spherical particle suspended in a near-critical binary fluid mixture. To capture the scaling behavior associated with critical adsorption in the strong adsorption regime, we employ the framework of local renormalized functional theory. Previous theoretical studies encountered numerical difficulties when attempting to solve the coupled hydrodynamic and chemical potential equations, expressed as integral equations, for systems with large bulk correlation lengths. These difficulties limited direct comparison with experimental results. In this study, we overcome those limitations by reformulating the hydrodynamic equations as a set of ordinary differential equations using a compactified radial coordinate. This approach enables more stable numerical computation and facilitates the implementation of appropriate boundary conditions at large distances from the particle. As a result, we successfully compute the drag coefficient over a broader range of bulk correlation lengths than in previous works and compare our theoretical predictions with available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the electronic ground state of He$_2^+$ by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excluding the very shallow potential minimum of the electronic ground state, all bound electronic states of He$_2$ have Rydberg character. Their potential-energy functions are similar to those of the He$_2^+$ states to which the Rydberg series converge. Photoionization and electron-impact ionization of the metastable $a~^3\Sigma_u^+$ state of He$_2$ are thus characterized by diagonal Franck-Condon factors and only provide access to low vibrational levels of the He$_2^+$ $X^+$ $^2\Sigma_u^+$ electronic ground state. For this reason, little experimental information is available on the excited vibrational levels of He$_2^+$. We report a measurement, by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy, of 17 vibrational levels of the $X^+$ $^2\Sigma_u^+$ state of $^4$He$_2^+$, with vibrational quantum number $v^+$ from 3 to 19 and covering more than 95% of the potential well. To access these states, we exploit a hump in the potential-energy function of the $c~^3\Sigma_g^+$ state, whose vibrational wavefunctions extend to large internuclear distance by quantum-mechanical tunneling through the potential barrier. Combining these results with data on the lowest ($v^+=0-2$) and highest ($v^+=22, 23$) vibrational levels of $^4$He$_2^+$, we derive a full map of the rovibrational structure of He$_2^+$ and, in a least-squares fit, an empirical effective potential-energy function that describes all experimental data within uncertainties. This function yields the positions of the 409 bound rovibrational levels and the positions and widths of the 74 shape resonances of the $X^+$ $^2\Sigma_u^+$ state of $^4$He$_2^+$. The dissociation energy of He$_2^+$ is $D{\rm e}=19,956.10(10)$ cm$^{-1}$ [$D_0(^4{\rm He}_2^+)=19,101.29(10)$ cm$^{-1}$].</description>

      <title>Precision Spectroscopy of the Fine Structure in the $\boldsymbol{a\;{}^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)}$ and $\boldsymbol{c\;{}^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)}$ States of the Helium Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With four electrons, He$_2$ is one of very few molecules for which first-principles quantum-chemical calculations that include the treatment of nonadiabatic, relativistic and quantum-electrodynamics corrections are possible. Precise spectroscopic measurements are needed as references to test these calculations. We report here on a spectroscopic measurement of the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+\leftarrow a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+$ electronic transition of $^4$He$_2$ at a precision ($\Delta \nu/\nu$) of $2.5\times 10^{-10}$ and with full resolution of the rotational, spin-spin and spin-rotational fine structures. The investigation focuses on transitions to the rotational levels of the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ state, located energetically above the He$(1$ $^1S_0) + $He$(2$ $^3S_1)$ dissociation limit and decaying by tunneling predissociation through a barrier in the $c$ state. The new data include a full map of the energy levels of the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with rotational quantum numbers $N$ up to 9 and 10, respectively, and full sets of fine-structure intervals in these levels for comparison with first-principles calculations from a parallel investigation [B. R\'acsai, P. Jeszenszki, A. Marg\'ocsy and E. Maty\'us, arXiv:2506.23879v1 (2025)]. The new data were combined with data from earlier measurements of the spectrum of the $c-a$ band system of $^4$He$_2$ to derive full sets of molecular constants for the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with much improved precision over previous experimental results. A pronounced broadening of the linewidths of the transitions to the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4,N=10)$ fine-structure levels is attributed to tunneling predissociation through a barrier in the potential of the $c$ state and is quantitatively accounted for by calculations of the predissociation widths.</description>

      <title>Fast and Generalizable parameter-embedded Neural Operators for Lithium-Ion Battery Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable digital twins of lithium-ion batteries must achieve high physical fidelity with sub-millisecond speed. In this work, we benchmark three operator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed parameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each spectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are trained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant, triangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of State-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates constant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO maintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with voltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing parameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to varying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster than a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse tasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation, recovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute percentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in comparison with classical methods. These results pave the way for neural operators to meet the accuracy, speed and parametric flexibility demands of real-time battery management, design-of-experiments and large-scale inference. PE-FNO outperforms conventional neural surrogates, offering a practical path towards high-speed and high-fidelity electrochemical digital twins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum and molecular mechanics based electronic energy studies of weak H-bonded ammonium dimer show distinctive feature in energy profile when computed by different QM methods contrast to MM methods. MM based MMFF and SYBYL methods show smoothly varying dihedral energy profile for torsion angle variation around weak N1-H5 held by H-bond strength of around 13 KJ/mol. All the QM based methods HF, B3LYP and MP2 show noisy and unstable torsion dependent electronic energy profile for H-bonded ammonium dimer. Exploring energy surface beyond bond length shows singularities and discontinuities. QM-based computation of dipole moment shows several discreet values with jumps and discontinuities with torsion angle variation for ammonium dimer. Also repeated computations and reverse torsion energy profile show persistent singularity feature observed in all standard QM techniques.

      <title>Acid Base Chemistry of Short Hydrogen Bonds: A Tale of Schr\"odinger's Cat in Glutamine-Derived Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short hydrogen bonds (SHBs), defined by donor-acceptor distances below 2.5 Angstrom, represent a distinct regime in acid-base chemistry where conventional models of hydrogen bonding break down. In an organic crystal formed via a temperature-induced chemical transformation of L-glutamine, we previously identified an SHB that is permissive to proton transfer, leading to a characteristic double-well potential implying an activated process. Herein, using path-integral ab initio molecular dynamics (PI-AIMD), we show that nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) completely eliminate the classical barrier, leading to a symmetrization of the proton along the hydrogen bond. While in the classical case the proton transfer is strongly coupled to the rocking modes of the ammonium ion in the crystal, NQEs significantly reduce these correlations. Examining the electronic structure through Wannier centers (WCs) further reveals a quantum-driven redistribution of bonding electrons, blurring the distinction between hydrogen bonding and covalency. Taken together, our findings indicate that NQEs in this organic crystal lead to a situation where both the donor and acceptor can simultaneously act as both an acid and a base.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A challenge in modeling time-dependent strong-field processes such as high-harmonic generation for many-body systems, is how to effectively represent the electronic continuum. We apply Rothe's method to the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) and density functional theory (TDDFT) equations of motion for the orbitals, which reformulates them as an optimization problem. We show that thawed, complex-valued Gaussian basis sets can be propagated efficiently for these orbital-based approaches, removing the need for grids. In particular, we illustrate that qualitatively correct results can often be obtained by using just a few fully flexible Gaussians that describe the unbound dynamics for both TDHF and TDDFT. Grid calculations can be reproduced quantitatively using $30$--$100$ Gaussians for intensities up to $4\times10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$ for the one-dimensional molecular systems considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Computational chemistry tools are widely used to study the behaviour of chemical phenomena. Yet, the complexity of these tools can make them inaccessible to non-specialists and challenging even for experts. In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging &gt;87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>On the Simulation of Conical Intersections in Water and Methanimine Molecules Via Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of methanimine (CH2NH) and water (H2O) molecules in an effort to locate conical intersections (CIs) using variational quantum algorithms. Our approach implements and compares a range of hybrid quantum-classical methods, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), VQE with Automatically-Adjusted Constraints (VQE-AC), and we explore molecular configurations of interest using a State-Average (SA) approach. Exact Diagonalization is employed as the classical benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the quantum algorithms. We perform simulations across a range of molecular geometries, basis sets, and active spaces to compare each algorithm's performance and accuracy, and to enhance the detectability of CIs. This work confirms the quantum variational algorithms' capability of describing conical intersections in both molecules, as long as appropriate active spaces and geometries of the molecule are chosen. We also compare the accuracy and reliability of VQE-based methods for computing excited states with classical benchmark methods, and we demonstrate good agreement within desired regions.</description>
