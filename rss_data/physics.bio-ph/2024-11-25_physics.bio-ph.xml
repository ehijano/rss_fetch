      <title>Probing the structural stability of R-phycocyanin under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The red macroalgae Porphyra, commonly known as Nori, is widely used as food around the world due to its high nutrient content, including the significant abundance of coloured phycobiliproteins (PBPs). Among these, R-phycocyanin (R-PC) stands out for its vibrant purple colour and numerous bioactive properties, making it a valuable protein for the food industry. However, R-PC's limited thermal stability necessitates alternative processing methods to preserve its colour and bioactive properties. Our study aimed to investigate the in-situ stability of oligomeric R-PC under high pressure (HP) conditions (up to 4,000 bar) using a combination of absorption, fluorescence, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques. The unfolding of R-PC is a multiphase process. Initially, low pressure induces conformational changes in the R-PC oligomeric form (trimers). As pressure increases above 1,600 bar, these trimers dissociate into monomers, and at pressures above 3,000 bar, the subunits begin to unfold. When returned to atmospheric pressure, R-PC partially refolds, retaining 50% of its original colour absorbance. In contrast, heat treatment causes irreversible and detrimental effects on R-PC colour, highlighting the advantages of HP treatment in preserving both the colour and bioactive properties of R-PC compared to heat treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: HP is a powerful probe that reveals intermediate states of proteins through subtle structural changes not accessible by other denaturation methods. By combining HP-small-angle-Xray scattering with HP-absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, we elucidate the multiphase unfolding process of R-phycocyanin. This process includes: 1) conformational changes, 2) oligomer dissociation at moderate pressures, and 3) monomer unfolding. Our approach provides new opportunities for the structural determination of protein intermediates and oligomers using HP.</description>

      <title>Deep operator network models for predicting post-burn contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Burn injuries present a significant global health challenge. Among the most severe long-term consequences are contractures, which can lead to functional impairments and disfigurement. Understanding and predicting the evolution of post-burn wounds is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Traditional mathematical models, while accurate, are often computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting their practical application. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, offer promising alternatives for accelerating these predictions. This study explores the use of a deep operator network (DeepONet), a type of neural operator, as a surrogate model for finite element simulations, aimed at predicting post-burn contraction across multiple wound shapes. A DeepONet was trained on three distinct initial wound shapes, with enhancement made to the architecture by incorporating initial wound shape information and applying sine augmentation to enforce boundary conditions. The performance of the trained DeepONet was evaluated on a test set including finite element simulations based on convex combinations of the three basic wound shapes. The model achieved an $R^2$ score of $0.99$, indicating strong predictive accuracy and generalization. Moreover, the model provided reliable predictions over an extended period of up to one year, with speedups of up to 128-fold on CPU and 235-fold on GPU, compared to the numerical model. These findings suggest that DeepONets can effectively serve as a surrogate for traditional finite element methods in simulating post-burn wound evolution, with potential applications in medical treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Morphodynamics of surface-attached active drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological and synthetic systems are suspensions of oriented, actively-moving components. Unlike in passive suspensions, the interplay between orientational order, active flows, and interactions with boundaries gives rise to fascinating new phenomena in such active suspensions. Here, we examine the paradigmatic example of a surface-attached drop of an active suspension (an "active drop"), which has so far only been studied in the idealized limit of thin drops. We find that such surface-attached active drops can exhibit a wide array of stable steady-state shapes and internal flows that are far richer than those documented previously, depending on boundary conditions and the strength of active stresses. Our analysis uncovers quantitative principles to predict and even rationally control the conditions under which these different states arise -- yielding design principles for next-generation active materials.</description>

      <title>Entropic tug of war: Topological constraints spontaneously rectify the dynamics of a polymer with heterogeneous fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers with active segments constitute prospective future materials and are used as a model for some biological systems such as chromatin. The directions of the active forces are typically introduced with temporal or spatial correlations to establish directional motion of the chain and corresponding active dynamics. Instead, here we consider an active-passive copolymer, where the two segments differ only by the magnitude of their fluctuations and feature no artificial correlations. Here we show that although the model itself does not possess directional dynamics, if the chains are concentrated, directional persistent motion spontaneously arises as a consequence of the broken translational symmetry owing to the topological constraints. Using scaling arguments and simulations, we explain the phenomenon and describe the ensuing dynamics. Our work has thus far-reaching consequences for the mechanical properties of all dense active polymeric systems with heterogeneous fluctuations and in particular for chromatin conformation and dynamics that are crucial for biological functionality.</description>

      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11979v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude compared to the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the downside of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular processes.</description>

      <title>Depletion interaction between cylindrical inclusions in polymer brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cylindrical inclusions in mobile brushes experience apparent attraction, which arises from a tendency to minimize the depletion zone around the inclusions, thereby maximizing the overall entropy. We find that correlation blobs act as the basic units of the attraction. In tall brushes, however, the depletion zone formed above the inclusions can generate repulsion, partially offsetting the depletion attraction. Our study offers physical insights into the brush-induced depletion interaction and suggests it as a mechanism for protein cluster formation on cell surfaces.</description>
