      <title>Thermoelectric transport through a Majorana zero modes interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the thermoelectric characteristics of a system consisting of two topological superconducting nanowires, each exhibiting Majorana zero modes at their ends, connected to leads within an interferometer configuration. By employing Green's function formalism, we derive the spectral properties and transport coefficients. Our findings indicate that bound states in the continuum (BICs) manifest in symmetric setups, influenced by the length of the wires and coupling parameters. Deviations of the magnetic flux from specific values transform BICs into quasi-BICs with finite width, resulting in conductance antiresonances. The existence and interplay of Majorana zero modes enhance thermoelectric performance in asymmetric configurations. Modulating the magnetic flux transitions BICs into quasi-BICs significantly enhances the Seebeck coefficient and figure of merit, thereby proposing a strategy for optimizing thermoelectric efficiency in systems based on Majorana zero modes.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity ground state in dilute Yu-Shiba-Rusinov dimers and chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic adatoms on superconductors induce Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states, which are key to the design of low-dimensional correlated systems and topological superconductivity. Competing magnetic interactions and superconducting pairing lead to a rich phase diagram. Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), we position Fe atoms on 2H-NbSe$_2$ to build a dimer with an odd-parity ground state, i.e., a partially screened YSR channel with the hybridized states spanning the Fermi level. This ground state makes the dimer a promising precursor for a topological YSR chain. By adding one atom at a time, we track the formation of YSR bands. The lowest-energy band crosses the Fermi level and we find strong site-dependent spectral variations especially at the chain's terminations. We attribute these features to quantum spin effects and ferromagnetic coupling influenced by the local chemical environment, rather than topological superconductivity or Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Appearance of Multiple Spectral Gaps in Voltage-Biased Josephson Junctions Without Floquet Hybridization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A time-periodic drive enables the engineering of non-equilibrium quantum systems by hybridizing Floquet sidebands. We investigated DC voltage-biased planar Josephson junctions built upon epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructures in which the intrinsic AC Josephson effect is theoretically expected to provide a time-periodic drive leading to Floquet hybridization. Tunneling spectroscopy is performed using probes positioned at the ends of the junction to study the evolution of the local density of states. With applied drive, we observe multiple coherence peaks which are studied as a function of DC voltage bias and in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis suggests that these spectral gaps arise from a direct mesoscopic coupling between the tunneling probe and the superconducting leads rather than from a Floquet-driven gap opening. Our numerical simulations indicate that an increase in the ratio of junction width to coherence length will enhance the contribution of Floquet hybridization. This work lays a foundation for the exploration of Floquet physics utilizing voltage-biased hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions and provides means for distinguishing direct couplings from genuine Floquet effects.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e enhanced flat band in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) is a fascinating emergent quantum state characterized by fractionally charged excitations in the absence of magnetic field,which could arise from the intricate interplay between electron correlation, nontrivial topology and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, FQAHE has been realized in aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene on BN superlattice (aligned R5G/BN), where the topological flat band is modulated by the moir\'e potential. However, intriguingly, the FQAHE is observed only when electrons are pushed away from the moir\'e interface. The apparently opposite implications from these experimental observations, along with different theoretical models, have sparked intense debates regarding the role of the moir\'e potential. Unambiguous experimental observation of the topological flat band as well as moir\'e bands with energy and momentum resolved information is therefore critical to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Here by performing nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (NanoARPES) measurements, we directly reveal the topological flat band electronic structures of R5G, from which key hopping parameters essential for determining the fundamental electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene are extracted. Moreover, a comparison of electronic structures between aligned and non-aligned samples reveals that the moir\'e potential plays a pivotal role in enhancing the topological flat band in the aligned sample. Our study provides experimental guiding lines to narrow down the phase space of rhombohedral graphene, laying an important foundation for understanding exotic quantum phenomena in this emerging platform.</description>

      <title>Oscillating-charged Andreev Bound States and Their Appearance in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface Andreev bound states, including Majorana bound states in topological superconductors, are typically charge neutral. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional charged Andreev bound states in a superconductor with a sublattice degree of freedom, where the sign of charge density of the Andreev bound states oscillates between the two sublattices. The oscillating-charged Andreev bound states lead to a complete breakdown of the proportionality among the electron part of the spectral function, the local density of states, and the tunneling conductance spectrum for energies below the superconducting gap. We also discuss the possible occurrence of these Andreev bound states in UTe$_2$ and locally noncentrosymmetric superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized Specular Andreev Reflections in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show theoretically that specular Andreev reflection occurs stably at altermagnet--superconductor interfaces, which is a phenomenon that has previously been predicted only in a limited range of materials, such as Dirac/Weyl materials with fine-tuned chemical potentials. Furthermore, the characteristic spin-split bands of the altermagnet lead to a distinctive spin polarization in the specular Andreev reflections. By utilizing this feature, we propose a device that integrates the functions of both a Cooper pair splitter and a spin beam splitter, thereby creating energy-entangled electron pairs. The positive nonlocal conductance and the positive noise cross-correlation are unambiguous signatures of specular Andreev reflections in the proposed device.</description>

      <title>Tunable second harmornic in altermagnetic Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of external electric and Zeeman fields on the Josephson effect in a planar superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor junction. Remarkably, we find that the current-phase relation (CPR) can be forward or backward skewed due to a pronounced second harmonic term. It decisively depends on the altermagnetic field strength. This second harmonic can be measured directly using double SQUID devices. The CPR skewness can be effectively manipulated by electric gating. Moreover, we identify two additional impacts of external electric and magnetic fields on the Josephson current: (i) Fields can induce 0-$\pi$ transitions. (ii) Fields can substantially enhance the critical current. This enhancement is surprising since supercurrents are typically suppressed by magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of Tc enhancement above 50 K and diode and paramagnetic-Meissner effects, in Nickelate films on highly reduced $SrTiO_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of superconductivity in nickelate thin films in 2019, the quest for enhancing their $T_c$ has been ongoing. Here we provide experimental evidence for $T_c$ enhancement in oxygen deficient films on highly reduced and conducting $SrTiO_3$ substrates. $T_c$ onset of 50-70 K was found in Meissner and transport measurements, which indicates superconductivity in islands or domains in our films, where $T_c$ of zero resistance is obtained at 20-25 K. In addition, we observed a giant paramagnetic-Meissner effect peak at about 48 K, which further supports the existence of a superconductive transition just above it. Furthermore, an asymmetric or nonreciprocal and non-hysteretic superconductive diode effect was observed. The later could be fully polarized, and its polarity could be reversed. In our films we identified the infinite-layer 112 and the perovskite 113 phases, with a variety of oxygen stoichiometries in between.</description>

      <title>Charge-polarized superconducting state emerged in a superatomic antipolar metal</title>

Abstract: Symmetry-defined order states play essential roles in determining the emergent exotic physical properties in condensed matter physics, including charge density wave (CDW), polar charge order, and superconducting (SC) states. Recently, the interweaved CDW and antipolar states have been discovered in a low-symmetric superatomic crystal of (Au6Te12Se8, ATS), while their delicate interplay with the following emergent SC state at lower temperature remains elusive. Here, we report a real-space experimental investigation on the coexistence and competition of CDW, polar and SC states in the metallic crystal of ATS using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy combined with transport and Raman measurements. We show that the CDW order is gradually suppressed with the decreased temperature, and a further transformation from antipolar to ferrielectric-like order occurs with the inversion-symmetric broken at the SC state. These spatially observed the emergence and competition of the above ordered states coincide with the temperature-dependent transport and Raman measurements. We predict that the delicate interplay among these states may contribute exotic "hidden" orders in this superatomic metal, suggesting a unique platform for the exploration of intriguing quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of Persistent Zero Modes and Superconducting Vortex Doublets in UTe$_2$</title>

Abstract: Superconducting vortices can reveal electron pairing details and nucleate topologically protected states. Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Space AC Josephson Effect and Intervalley Coherence in Multilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in charge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the collective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it generates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference patterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent dynamics in the intervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekul\'e distorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under a static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating intervalley current, which in turn causes oscillating orbital magnetization, thereby inducing a detectable AC Hall effect. This mechanism mirrors the AC Josephson effect observed in superconductors but now happening in momentum space. In this analogy, the static magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating intervalley current assumes the role of the AC Josephson current. We present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the phase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an orbital magnetization oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1 Tesla. We comment on this phase-coherent dynamics in other 2D materials like twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>
