      <title>MADWAVE3: a quantum time dependent wave packet code for nonadiabatic state-to-state reaction dynamics of triatomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MADWAVE3, a FORTRAN90 code designed for quantum time dependent wave packet propagation in triatomic systems. This program allows the calculation of state-to-state probabilities for inelastic and reactive collisions, as well as photodissociation processes, over one or multiple coupled diabatic electronic states. The code is highly parallelized using MPI and OpenMP. The execution requires the potential energy surfaces of the different electronic states involved, as well as the transition dipole moments for photodissociation processes. The formalism underlying the code is presented in section 2, together with the modular structure of the code. This is followed by the installation procedures and a comprehensive list and explanation of the parameters that control the code, organized within their respective namelists. Finally, a case study is presented, focusing on the prototypical reactive collision H+DH(v,j) -&gt; H2(v',j') + D. Both the potential energy surface and the input files required to reproduce the calculation are provided and are available on the repository main page. This example is used to study the parallelization speedup of the code.</description>

      <title>Predicting Organic-Inorganic Halide Perovskite Photovoltaic Performance from Optical Properties of Constituent Films through Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a machine learning (ML) approach that accurately predicts the current-voltage behavior of 3D/2D-structured (FAMA)Pb(IBr)3/OABr hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite (HOIP) solar cells under AM1.5 illumination. Our neural network algorithm is trained on measured responses from several hundred HOIP solar cells, using three simple optical measurements of constituent HOIP films as input: optical transmission spectrum, spectrally-resolved photoluminescence, and time-resolved photoluminescence, from which we predict the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factors (FF) values of solar cells that contain the HOIP active layers. Determined average prediction accuracies for 95 % of the predicted Voc, Jsc, and FF values are 91%, 94% and 89%, respectively, with R2 coefficients of determination of 0.47, 0.77, and 0.58, respectively. Quantifying the connection between ML predictions and physical parameters extracted from the measured HOIP films optical properties, allows us to identify the most significant parameters influencing the prediction results. With separate ML-classifying algorithms, we identify degraded solar cells using the same optical input data, achieving over 90% classification accuracy through support vector machine, cross entropy loss, and artificial neural network algorithms. To our knowledge, the demonstrated regression and classification work is the first to use ML to predict device photovoltaic properties solely from the optical properties of constituent materials.</description>

      <title>Unified gas-kinetic scheme for reactive flow with multi-scale transport and chemical non-equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactive flows for rarefied gas mixtures involve a multi-scale transport characterized by particle collisions and free streaming, and non-equilibrium physics containing multi-species interactions, and chemical non-equilibrium. These flows are pivotal in aerospace engineering and semiconductor manufacturing, impacting spacecraft control and thermal protection in near-space flight, and plasma etching for chip processing. Therefore, the simulation of these multi-scale and non-equilibrium flow is of scientific and industrial significance. Following the methodology of direct modeling, the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) is constructed to describe the multi-scale transport of gas molecules across all flow regimes. This study extends the UGKS to the reactive flows with chemical non-equilibrium for the capture of more complex flow physics. Test cases, including shock structures, hypersonic flows around a two-dimensional cylinder and the three-dimensional re-entry and space vehicle, and nozzle plume flow into a vacuum, are used to validate the UGKS through the comparison with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The study shows that the methodology of direct modeling and the extended UGKS have great potential for simulating multi-scale flows with complex non-equilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional next-generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09800v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) has attracted much attention due to its excellent performance in spatio-temporal forecasting of complex systems and its ease of implementation. This paper shows that NG-RC can be encoded as a kernel ridge regression that makes training efficient and feasible even when the space of chosen polynomial features is very large. Additionally, an extension to an infinite number of covariates is possible, which makes the methodology agnostic with respect to the lags into the past that are considered as explanatory factors, as well as with respect to the number of polynomial covariates, an important hyperparameter in traditional NG-RC. We show that this approach has solid theoretical backing and good behavior based on kernel universality properties previously established in the literature. Various numerical illustrations show that these generalizations of NG-RC outperform the traditional approach in several forecasting applications.</description>

      <title>Universality of extreme events in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universality of small scales, a cornerstone of turbulence, has been nominally confirmed for low-order mean-field statistics, such as the energy spectrum. However, small scales exhibit strong intermittency, exemplified by formation of extreme events which deviate anomalously from a mean-field description. Here, we investigate the universality of small scales by analyzing extreme events of velocity gradients in different turbulent flows, viz. direct numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, inhomogeneous channel flow, and laboratory measurements in a von Karman mixing tank. We demonstrate that the scaling exponents of velocity gradient moments, as function of Reynolds number ($Re$), are universal, in agreement with previous studies at lower $Re$, and further show that even proportionality constants are universal when considering one moment order as a function of another. Additionally, by comparing various unconditional and conditional statistics across different flows, we demonstrate that the structure of the velocity gradient tensor is also universal. Overall, our findings provide compelling evidence that even extreme events are universal, with profound implications for turbulence theory and modeling.</description>

      <title>Approximations of the Green's Function in Multiple Scattering Theory for Crystalline Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multiple scattering theory (MST) is a Green's function method that has been widely used in electronic structure calculations for crystalline disordered systems. The key property of the MST method is the scattering path matrix (SPM) that characterizes the Green's function within a local solution representation. This paper studies various approximations of the SPM, under the condition that an appropriate reference is used for perturbation. In particular, we justify the convergence of the SPM approximations with respect to the size of scattering region and the length of scattering path, which are the central numerical parameters to achieve a linear-scaling MST method. We present numerical experiments on several typical systems to support the theory.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the optimization process of Physics Informed Neural Networks: How accurate and competitive can PINNs be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across various fields.</description>

      <title>Critical temperature of the classical XY model via autoencoder latent space sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical XY model has been consistently studied since it was introduced more than six decades ago. Of particular interest has been the two-dimensional spin model's exhibition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This topological phenomenon describes the transition from bound vortex-antivortex pairs at low temperatures to unpaired or isolated vortices and anti-vortices above some critical temperature. In this work we propose a novel machine learning based method to determine the emergence of this phase transition. An autoencoder was used to map states of the XY model into a lower dimensional latent space. Samples were taken from this latent space to determine the thermal average of the vortex density which was then used to determine the critical temperature of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>
