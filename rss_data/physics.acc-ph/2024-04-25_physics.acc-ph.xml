      <title>On planar (110) channeling of 855 MeV electrons in a boron-doped diamond undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 4-period diamond undulator with a thickness of 20 $\mu$m was produced with the method of Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVC), applying boron doping, on a straight diamond crystal with an effective thickness of 165.5 $\mu$m. A planar (110) channeling experiment, performed with the high quality 855 MeV electron beam of the Mainz Microtron MAMI accelerator facility, failed to observe the expected undulator peak. Simulation calculations which are based on the continuum potential picture revealed unexpected results for radiation spectra at the chosen observation direction. They suggest, in addition, that at an optimized observation angle, for which the undulator peak is the strongest, the channeling radiation from the rather thick backing crystal can be significantly suppressed. A byproduct of this case study was the experimental observation that beam deflection can be achieved even with a flat 50 $\mu$m thick diamond crystal.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Cavity Fault Prediction Using Deep Learning at Jefferson Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating cavities are an integral part of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Laboratory. When any of the over 400 cavities in CEBAF experiences a fault, it disrupts beam delivery to experimental user halls. In this study, we propose the use of a deep learning model to predict slowly developing cavity faults. By utilizing pre-fault signals, we train a LSTM-CNN binary classifier to distinguish between radio-frequency (RF) signals during normal operation and RF signals indicative of impending faults. We optimize the model by adjusting the fault confidence threshold and implementing a multiple consecutive window criterion to identify fault events, ensuring a low false positive rate. Results obtained from analysis of a real dataset collected from the accelerating cavities simulating a deployed scenario demonstrate the model's ability to identify normal signals with 99.99% accuracy and correctly predict 80% of slowly developing faults. Notably, these achievements were achieved in the context of a highly imbalanced dataset, and fault predictions were made several hundred milliseconds before the onset of the fault. Anticipating faults enables preemptive measures to improve operational efficiency by preventing or mitigating their occurrence.</description>
