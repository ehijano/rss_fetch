      <title>Protocellular energetics: Free energy estimates for all metabolic, self-assembly and vesicle fission processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As minimal cells or protocells are dramatically simpler than modern unicells it is possible to quantitatively estimate free energy changes for every process in the lifecycle of a protocell and compare these with estimates of the free energy changes for lifecycles in modern unicells. We present quantitative estimates of all metabolic changes in part by new density function theory (DFT) estimations, in part by compiling previously measured or estimated free energy changes, and in part by new thermodynamic calculations for all self-assembly, vesicle bending, and fission energies.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of chiral actin filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of actin filaments are essential to their biological functions. Here, we introduce a highly coarse-grained model of actin filaments that preserves helicity and chirality while enabling mesoscale simulations. The framework is implemented in Cytosim, an open-source cytoskeleton simulation platform. We can predict and finely control the shape and mechanical properties of this helical filament, that can be matched to experimental values. Using this model, we investigated the role of filament chirality in motor-driven dynamics. We first show that in two different experimental configurations, motor movement along a helical filament results in a chiral motion of the filament. In a bundle of helical filaments, dimeric motors exert torques on each filament, inducing collective behaviors in the bundle such as rotation, coiling, and helical buckling, reminiscent of those observed in filopodia. Together, these results demonstrate the central role of helicity and chirality in actin mechanics and motor-driven dynamics, and establish our framework as a powerful tool for mesoscale simulations. This framework can also be used for other helical filaments beyond actin.</description>

      <title>A biological hydraulic accumulator: How the squirting cucumber, Ecballium elaterium, squirts its seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seed dispersal is a fundamental process that allows offspring to reach suitable habitats and colonize new environments. While most plants rely on external vectors, some have evolved mechanisms that employ the buildup of liquid pressure in a closed compartment and its explosive release to disperse their seeds. This form of energy storage, reinvented by humans for engineering applications, is termed a hydraulic accumulator. Here we investigated the fluid mechanics involved in dispersal in the squirting cucumber, Ecballium elaterium integrating high-speed videography (up to 10 000 fps), microtomography, and internal pressure sensors. We recorded long-term pressure time series showing that E. elaterium exhibits circadian (24 hour) and ultradian (short-period) rhythms. Remarkably, the measurements revealed a lack of correlation between fruit and stem turgor; while the stem showed strong circadian cycles, the fruit often did not, suggesting isolated physiological processes in different tissues. The fruit's spongy wall tissue stores elastic potential energy as turgor pressure builds to nearly one atmosphere (92-99 kPa). Upon detachment, this energy is rapidly released to expel a turbulent, particle-laden liquid jet. Microtomography revealed that the seeds are packed around a central funiculus, a configuration that optimizes their exit through the basal orifice at velocities of up to 30 m/s. Seeds eventually move faster than the liquid droplets during the later stages of ejection as they shed their liquid coating. This sophisticated mechanism ensures a broad dispersal cone, effectively spreading offspring across space and environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Complexity and dynamics of partially symmetric random neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural circuits exhibit structured connectivity, including an overrepresentation of reciprocal connections between neuron pairs. Despite important advances, a full understanding of how such partial symmetry in connectivity shapes neural dynamics remains elusive. Here we ask how correlations between reciprocal connections in a random, recurrent neural network affect phase-space complexity, defined as the exponential proliferation rate (with network size) of the number of fixed points that accompanies the transition to chaotic dynamics. We find a striking pattern: partial anti-symmetry strongly amplifies complexity, while partial symmetry suppresses it. These opposing trends closely track changes in other measures of dynamical behavior, such as dimensionality, Lyapunov exponents, and transient path length, supporting the view that fixed-point structure is a key determinant of network dynamics. Thus, positive reciprocal correlations favor low-dimensional, slowly varying activity, whereas negative correlations promote high-dimensional, rapidly fluctuating chaotic activity. These results yield testable predictions about the link between connection reciprocity, neural dynamics and function.</description>

      <title>Local shear signals propagate to suppress local cellular motion in stiff epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As small particles skim our airways during breathing, or our intestines during digestion, the surface epithelium is subjected to local exogenous shear that deforms hundreds to thousands of tightly interacting cells. Unlike shear deformations applied at the macro-tissue scale or the micro-cell scale, the effects of such perturbations at the meso-scale remain largely unexplored. To address this, we developed a mesoscopic probe that adheres to the apical surface of an epithelial monolayer and applies magnetically derived local shear. We find that localized shear propagated way beyond immediate neighbors and suppressed cellular migratory dynamics in stiffer layers, yet dissipated locally and left dynamics unchanged in softer layers. This mechano-transductive view is reinforced by the observation that stiffening of a soft layer promotes responsiveness to shear. Interpreted within the epithelial jamming framework, shear-induced migratory suppression in stiff layers was accompanied by reduced MSD scaling exponents and changes in cell shape. These changes suggested a localized shift of the tissue toward a lower-energetic state. Together, these observations provide a new perspective on how a local mechanical perturbation traverses the epithelial monolayer to influence both nearby and distant cellular environments.</description>

      <title>In-vivo femtonewton-sensing nanotribology of Tradescantia zebrina leaf cell inner surface using roll rotation detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessing the properties of a plant cell interior non-invasively is difficult due to the presence of a cell wall. Nanoparticles larger than 5 nm cannot be readily phagocytosed inside the cell like animal cells. It is here that we realise that Tradescantia zebrina plant cells have prismatic forms of calcium oxalate crystals present inside them naturally. These crystals make a ready choice to study properties of the inner cell surface with the application of optical tweezers. Moreover, out-of-plane rotations in optical tweezers have begun to be explored only recently. The pitch rotation has been detected with high resolution and several applications are explored. In this work, we first study the stable configuration while trapped in linearly polarized optical tweezers and then explore the other out-of-plane configurations to detect the roll rotation at high resolution. Then a micro-rheological analysis is performed to obtain the frictional properties of the inner surface of the plasma membrane of the leaf cell. The size of the particle is about 5 $\mu$m along the diagonal, so that the contact length with the surface is about 200 nm. We measure a frictional force of 18.5 pN at a sensitivity of about 200 fN without averaging.</description>

      <title>Modelling the movements of organisms by stochastic theory in a comoving frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine you walk in a plane. You move by making a step of a certain length per time interval in a chosen direction. Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membrane particles such as proteins and lipids organize into zones that perform unique functions. Here, I introduce a topological and category-theoretic framework to represent particle and zone intra-scale interactions and inter-scale coupling. This involves carefully demarcating between different presheaf- or sheaf-assigned data levels to preserve functorial structure and account for particle and zone generalized poses. The framework can accommodate Hamiltonian mechanics, enabling dynamical modeling. This amounts to a versatile mathematical formalism for membrane structure and multiscale coupling.</description>

      <title>Epigenetic Control and Reprogramming-Induced Potential Landscapes of Gene Regulatory Networks: A Quantitative Theoretical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an extended Dynamical Mean Field Theory framework to analyze gene regulatory networks (GRNs) incorporating epigenetic modifications. Building on the Hopfield network model analogy to spin glass systems, our approach introduces dynamic terms representing DNA methylation and histone modification to capture their regulatory influence on gene expression. The resulting formulation reduces high-dimensional GRN dynamics to effective stochastic equations, enabling the characterization of both stable and oscillatory states in epigenetically regulated systems. This framework provides a tractable and quantitative method for linking gene regulatory dynamics with epigenetic control, offering new theoretical insights into developmental processes and cell fate decisions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Interfacial Diffusion Control in Amphiphilic Lipid-Coated Micro-Particles for Stochastic Release Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The release of hydrophilic solutes from micron scale particulate formulations can be understood as an interfacial transport problem in which diffusion across a heterogeneous amphiphilic coating competes with dissolution and convective removal in the surrounding medium. Here we reinterpret a glycerin fatty acid ester (GFAE) coated thiamine (vitamin B1) micro particle formulation as a condensed matter system: a soft matter core shell geometry whose effective permeability is set by the nanoscale organization of amphiphilic lipids at the interface. Using in vivo time course serum measurements in mice as a proxy for a stochastic sink, we compare the coated formulation (UTEV) with a composition matched uncoated comparator (UMFG). Early time systemic appearance is similar, whereas late time levels are enhanced for the coated particles, implying a reduced effective interfacial diffusivity and a broadened release-time distribution. We discuss the results in terms of diffusion barrier physics, heterogeneous interfacial energetics, and coarse grained transport models that map microstructural coating parameters to macroscopic persistence (AUC).</description>

      <title>Exact Identity Linking Entropy Production and Mutual Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linking entropy production (EP) to information is a key step toward data-driven nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We derive an exact identity for overdamped Langevin dynamics that equates the total EP rate to the mutual-information rate between an infinitesimal displacement and its time-symmetric midpoint, up to a bulk mean-flow contribution. This mapping elevates information theory to a thermodynamic calculus: the chain rule yields a canonical, nonnegative split into self and interaction EP, and leads to a tighter bound on learning rate with interaction EP as the necessary cost. As a proof of concept, applying the estimator to red-blood-cell flickering shows that interaction EP robustly exposes active signatures that conventional summaries can miss.</description>

      <title>Large language models and the entropy of English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.</description>

      <title>A simple generalization of the energy gap law for nonradiative processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.09464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For more than 50 years, an elegant energy gap (EG) law developed by Englman and Jortner [Mol. Phys. {\bf 18}, 145 (1970)] has served as a key theory to understand and model nearly exponential dependence of nonradiative transition rates on the difference of energy between the initial and final states. This work revisits the theory, clarifies key assumptions involved in the rate expression, and provides a generalization for the cases where the effects of temperature dependence and low frequency modes cannot be ignored. For a specific example where the low frequency vibrational and/or solvation responses can be modeled as an Ohmic spectral density, a simple generalization of the EG law is provided. Test calculations demonstrate that this generalized EG law brings significant improvement over the original EG law. Both the original and generalized EG laws are also compared with stationary phase approximations developed for electron transfer theory, which suggests the possibility of a simple interpolation formula valid for any value of EG.</description>

      <title>Partially polaron-transformed quantum master equation for exciton and charge transport dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaron-transformed quantum master equation (PQME) offers a unified framework to describe the dynamics of quantum systems in both limits of weak and strong couplings to environmental degrees of freedom. Thus, PQME serves as an efficient method to describe charge and exciton transfer/transport dynamics for a broad range of parameters in condensed or complex environments. However, in some cases, the polaron transformation (PT) being employed in the formulation invokes an over-relaxation of slow modes and results in premature suppression of important coherence terms. A formal framework to address this issue is developed in the present work by employing a partial PT that has smaller weights for low frequency bath modes. It is shown here that a closed form expression of a 2nd order time-local PQME including all the inhomogeneous terms can be derived for a general form of partial PT, although more complicated than that for the full PT. All the expressions needed for numerical calculation are derived in detail. Applications to a model of two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, with test calculations focused on those due to homogeneous relaxation terms, demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of the present approach.</description>

Abstract: Network remodeling, or adaptation, in the presence of periodically driven forcings has hereto remained largely unexplored, despite the fact that a broad class of biological transport networks, e.g. animal vasculature, depends on periodic driving (pulsatility of the heart) to maintain flow. Short-term pulsatile dynamics of compliant vessels affects the long-term structures of adapting networks; however, what the correct adaptation rule is for pulsatile flows still remains an open question. Here we propose a new adaptation rule for periodically driven complex elastic networks that accounts for the effect of short-term pulsatile dynamics on the remodeling signal at long time-scales. Using this rule to adapt hierarchical elastic networks with multiple levels of looping, we show that very different network architectures are possible at steady-state depending on the driving frequency of the pulsatile source and the geometric asymmetry of the paths between the externally driven nodes of the network. Specifically resonant frequencies are shown to prioritize the stabilization of fully looped structures or higher level loops proximal to the source, whereas anti-resonant frequencies predominantly stabilize loop-less structures or lower-level loops distal to the source. Thus, this model offers a mechanism that can explain the stabilization of phenotypically diverse loopy network architectures in response to source pulsatility under physiologically relevant conditions and in the absence of other known loop stabilization mechanisms, such as random fluctuations in the load or perfusion homogenization.</description>

Abstract: In biosensing and diagnostic applications, a key objective is to design detection systems capable of identifying targets at very low concentrations, i.e., achieving high sensitivity. Here, we propose a linker-mediated detection scheme in which the presence of multivalent target molecules (linkers) facilitates the adsorption of ligand-coated guest nanoparticles onto a receptor-coated host substrate. Through a combination of computer simulations and mean-field theory, we demonstrate that, at fixed overall binding strength, increasing the valency of linkers exponentially lowers the concentration threshold for detection. This counterintuitive behavior arises from the combinatorial entropy associated with multivalent binding configurations, which tremendously amplifies the adsorption sensitivity and enables the identification of targets at extremely low concentrations. Our findings highlight multivalency engineering of linkers as a powerful strategy to substantially enhance the sensitivity of biodetection systems.</description>
