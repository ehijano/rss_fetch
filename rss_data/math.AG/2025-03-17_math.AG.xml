      <title>Rational Functions on the Projective Line from a Computational Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_d^1$ of degree $d \geq 3$ rational functions on the projective line using a machine learning approach, focusing on automorphism group classification. For $d = 3$, where $\mathcal{M}_3^1 = {\mathbb P}_{\mathbf{w}}^5 ({\mathbb Q})$ with weights $\mathbf{w} = (2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6)$, we generate a dataset of 2,078,697 rational functions over $\Q$ with naive height $\leq 4$. Initial coefficient-based models achieved high overall accuracy but struggled with minority classes due to extreme class imbalance. By using invariants $\xi_0, \ldots, \xi_5$ as features in a Random Forest classifier, we achieved approximately 99.992\% accuracy, mirroring successes in genus 2 curves \cite{2024-03}. This highlights the transformative role of invariants in arithmetic dynamics, yet for $d &gt; 3$, unknown generators of $\mathcal{R}_{(d+1, d-1)}$ pose scalability challenges. Our framework bridges data-driven and algebraic methods, with potential extensions to higher degrees and $\mathcal{M}_d^2$.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal successive minima, partial jets and convex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11042v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two sets of invariants for a line bundle at a point: infinitesimal successive minima and asymptotic partial jet separation. They are inspired by the local analogue of Ambro-Ito, and by the jet-theoretic interpretation of the Seshadri constant respectively. Under mild restrictions the two sets are equal. Moving to convex geometry, we prove that the lengths of the maximal simplex inside the generic infinitesimal Newton-Okounkov body (iNObody) of the line bundle at the point are precisely the successive minima. As application we characterize when this body is simplicial, and give examples when it is not. When the point is very general the convex body has a shape that we call Borel-fixed, a property inspired by generic initial ideals. Borel-fixed convex bodies satisfy simplicial lower bounds and polytopal upper bounds determined by their widths. For the generic iNObody of the line bundle at very general points these widths are again the infinitesimal successive minima.</description>

      <title>Planar tropical caustics: trivalency and convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical caustic of a convex domain on the plane is a canonically associated tropical analytic curve inside the domain. In this note we give a graphical proof for the classification of its intermediate vertices, implying in particular that they are always trivalent. Apart from that we explain how various known examples of tropical caustics are constructed and discuss the possibility of relaxing the convexity condition for the domain.</description>

      <title>Tensor Products of Quiver Bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a notion of tensor product of (twisted) quiver representations with relations in the category of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. As a first application of our notion, we see that tensor products of polystable quiver bundles are polystable and later we use this to both deduce a quiver version of the Segre embedding and to identify distinguished closed subschemes of $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$-character varieties of free abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Computing Certificates of Strictly Positive Polynomials in Archimedean Quadratic Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New results on computing certificates of strictly positive polynomials in Archimedean quadratic modules are presented. The results build upon (i) Averkov's method for generating a strictly positive polynomial for which a membership certificate can be more easily computed than the input polynomial whose certificate is being sought, and (ii) Lasserre's method for generating a certificate by successively approximating a nonnegative polynomial by sums of squares. First, a fully constructive method based on Averkov's result is given by providing details about the parameters; further, his result is extended to work on arbitrary subsets, in particular, the whole Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, producing globally strictly positive polynomials. Second, Lasserre's method is integrated with the extended Averkov construction to generate certificates. Third, the methods have been implemented and their effectiveness is illustrated. Examples are given on which the existing software package RealCertify appears to struggle, whereas the proposed method succeeds in generating certificates. Several situations are identified where an Archimedean polynomial does not have to be explicitly included in a set of generators of an Archimedean quadratic module. Unlike other approaches for addressing the problem of computing certificates, the methods/approach presented is easier to understand as well as implement.</description>

      <title>Hecke orbits on Shimura varieties of Hodge type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Hecke orbit conjecture of Chai--Oort for Shimura varieties of Hodge type at odd primes of good reduction. We use a novel result for the local monodromy groups of $F$-isocrystals "coming from geometry", which refines Crew's parabolicity conjecture. In the course of the proof, we also introduce a noncommutative generalisation of Serre--Tate coordinates for formal neighbourhoods of central leaves, built upon the previous work of Caraiani--Scholze and Kim. Using these coordinates, we reinterpret Chai--Oort's notion of strongly Tate-linear subspaces and we establish upper bounds for their monodromy groups. For this step, we employ the notion of Cartier--Witt stacks, as introduced by Drinfeld and Bhatt--Lurie. Another crucial ingredient in the proof is a rigidity result proved by Chai--Oort, which shows that the relevant subspaces are strongly Tate-linear. On the way, we generalise de Jong's full faithfulness theorem for $F$-isocrystals.</description>

      <title>Singular matroid realization spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study smoothness of realization spaces of matroids for small rank and ground set. For $\mathbb{C}$-realizable matroids, when the rank is $3$, we prove that the realization spaces are all smooth when the ground set has $11$ or fewer elements, and there are singular realization spaces for $12$ and greater elements. For rank $4$ and $9$ or fewer elements, we prove that these realization spaces are smooth. As an application, we prove that $\text{Gr}^{\circ}(3,n;\mathbb{C})$ -- the locus of the Grassmannian where all Pl\"ucker coordinates are nonzero -- is not sch\"on for $n\geq 12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13502v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the construction (due to Brenner--Schr\"oer) of the Proj scheme associated with a ring graded by a finitely generated abelian group. This construction generalizes the well-known Grothendieck Proj construction for $\mathbb{N}$-graded rings; we extend some classical results (in particular, regarding quasi-coherent sheaves on such schemes) from the $\mathbb{N}$-graded setting to this general setting, and prove new results that make sense only in the general setting of Brenner--Schr\"oer. Finally, we show that flag varieties of reductive groups, as well as some vector bundles over such varieties attached to representations of a Borel subgroup, can be naturally interpreted in this formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an explicit construction of tilting bundles on cotangent bundles of Grassmannians of 2-planes. This construction is based on Kapranov's exceptional collection for the underlying Grassmannians, and utilizes specific iterative extensions. The resulting tilting bundle exhibits invariance under the derived equivalence for the stratified Mukai flop through the geometric categorical sl(2) action, providing a categorical lift of the K-theoretic canonical basis up to shifts.</description>

Our method is not specific to quartics and applies to algebraic curves of any degree.</description>

      <title>Positive geometries and canonical forms via mixed Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework, we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.</description>

      <title>A Generalized RSK for Enumerating Linear Series on $n$-pointed Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial proof of a recent geometric result of Farkas and Lian on linear series on curves with prescribed incidence conditions. The result states that the expected number of degree-$d$ morphisms from a general genus $g$, $n$-marked curve $C$ to $\mathbb{P}^r$, sending the marked points on $C$ to specified general points in $\mathbb{P}^r$, is equal to $(r+1)^g$ for sufficiently large $d$. This computation may be rephrased as an intersection problem on Grassmannians, which has a natural combinatorial interpretation in terms of Young tableaux by the classical Littlewood-Richardson rule. We give a bijection, generalizing the well-known RSK correspondence, between the tableaux in question and the $(r+1)$-ary sequences of length $g$, and we explore our bijection's combinatorial properties.
  We also apply similar methods to give a combinatorial interpretation and proof of the fact that, in the modified setting in which $r=1$ and several marked points map to the same point in $\mathbb{P}^1$, the number of morphisms is still $2^g$ for sufficiently large $d$.</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy theory of rigid analytic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To any rigid analytic space (in the sense of Fujiwara-Kato) we assign an $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant rigid analytic homotopy category with coefficients in any presentable category. We show some functorial properties of this assignment as a functor on the category of rigid analytic spaces. Moreover, we show that there exists a full six functor formalism for the precomposition with the analytification functor by evoking Ayoub's thesis. As an application, we identify connective analytic K-theory in the unstable homotopy category with both $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathrm{BGL}$ and the analytification of connective algebraic K-theory. As a consequence, we get a representability statement for coefficients in light condensed spectra.</description>

      <title>Matroids and amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, Kita--Yoshida and Cho--Matsumoto introduced intersection forms on the twisted (co)homologies of hyperplane arrangement complements. We give a closed combinatorial formula for these intersection pairings. We show that these intersection pairings are obtained from (continuous and discrete) Laplace transforms of subfans of the Bergman fan of the associated matroid. We compute inverses of these intersection pairings, allowing us to identify (variants of) these intersection forms with the contravariant form of Schechtman--Varchenko, and the bilinear form of Varchenko.
  Building on parallel joint work with C. Eur, we define a notion of scattering amplitudes for matroids. We show that matroid amplitudes satisfy locality and unitarity, and recover biadjoint scalar amplitudes in the case of the complete graphic matroid. We apply our formulae for twisted intersection forms to deduce old and new formulae for scattering amplitudes.</description>
