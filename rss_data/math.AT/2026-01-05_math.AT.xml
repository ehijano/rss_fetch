      <title>The fifth algebraic transfer in generic degrees and validation of a localized Kameko's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops our previous works concerning the classical Peterson hit problem of five variables for the 2-primary Steenrod algebra $\mathscr A$ in generic degrees and related applications. To illustrate the utility of the Steenrod algebra, we give a proof that $\mathbb{C}P^4/\mathbb{C}P^2$ and $\mathbb{S}^6\vee \mathbb{S}^8$ are not homotopy equivalent by demonstrating that they are not isomorphic as $\mathscr A$-modules. The results are used to describe the representations of the general linear group of rank $5$ over the binary field $\mathbb F_2.$ As a consequence, the fifth algebraic transfer is an isomorphism at the internal degrees under consideration. These results have also been completely verified based on our novel algorithmic programs implemented in the computer algebra systems SageMath and OSCAR, announced in [arXiv:2507.10108] and [arXiv:2509.09455]. We also study a localized variation of Kameko's conjecture concerning the dimension of the indecomposables $\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A}\mathbb F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m]$ relative to parameter vectors and prove that this conjecture is valid for all $m\geq 1$ in certain degrees.</description>

      <title>Limit Computation Over Posets via Minimal Initial Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that limits can be computed by restricting along an initial functor, and that this can often simplify limit computation. We systematically study the algorithmic implications of this idea for diagrams indexed by a finite poset. We say an initial functor $F\colon C\to D$ with $C$ small is \emph{minimal} if the sets of objects and morphisms of $C$ each have minimum cardinality, among the sources of all initial functors with target $D$. For $Q$ a finite poset or $Q\subseteq \mathbb N^d$ an interval (i.e., a convex, connected subposet), we describe all minimal initial functors $F\colon P\to Q$ and in particular, show that $F$ is always a poset inclusion. We give efficient algorithms to compute a choice of minimal initial functor. In the case that $Q\subseteq \mathbb N^d$ is an interval, we give asymptotically optimal bounds on $|P|$, the number of relations in $P$ (including identities), in terms of the number $n$ of minima of $Q$: We show that $|P|=\Theta(n)$ for $d\leq 3$, and $|P|=\Theta(n^2)$ for $d&gt;3$. We apply these results to give new bounds on the cost of computing $\lim G$ for a functor $G \colon Q\to \mathbf{Vec}$ valued in vector spaces. For $Q$ connected, we also give new bounds on the cost of computing the \emph{generalized rank} of $G$ (i.e., the rank of the induced map $\lim G\to \mathop{\mathrm{colim}} G$), which is of interest in topological data analysis.</description>

      <title>The equivariant cohomology ring of the representation variety $\Hom(\Z^2,\mathrm{GL}_n(\C))$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a presentation of the $\mathrm{GL}_n(\C)$-equivariant cohomology ring with $\Z$-coefficients of the variety $\Hom(\Z^2,\mathrm{GL}_n(\C))\subseteq \mathrm{GL}_n(\C)^2$ for any $n$. It is torsion free and minimally generated as a $H^\ast B\mathrm{GL}_n(\C)$-algebra by $3n$ elements. The ideal of relations is the saturation of an $n$-generator ideal by even powers of the Vandermonde polynomial. For coefficients in a field whose characteristic does not divide $n!$, we also give a presentation of the non-equivariant cohomology ring of $\Hom(\Z^2,\mathrm{GL}_n(\C))$.</description>

      <title>Detecting Zariski Pairs by Algorithms and Computational Classification in Conic Line Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to detecting Zariski pairs in conic line arrangements. Our method introduces a combinatorial condition that reformulates the tubular neighborhood homeomorphism criterion arising in the definition of Zariski pairs. This allows for a classification of arrangements into combinatorial equivalence classes, which we generate systematically via an inductive algorithm. For each class, potential Zariski pairs are examined using structural lemmas, projective equivalence, and fundamental group computations obtained through the Zariski van Kampen Theorem.</description>

      <title>Voronoi Percolation: Topological Stability and Giant Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological stability of Voronoi percolation in higher dimensions. We show that slightly increasing p allows a discretization that preserves increasing topological properties with high probability. This strengthens a theorem of Bollob\'as and Riordan and generalizes it to higher dimensions. As a consequence, we prove a sharp phase transition for the emergence of i-dimensional giant cycles in Voronoi percolation on the 2i-dimensional torus.</description>

      <title>A simple universal property of Thom ring spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7988</link>
      <description>arXiv:1411.7988v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple universal property of the multiplicative structure on the Thom spectrum of an $n$-fold loop map, obtained as a special case of a characterization of the algebra structure on the colimit of a lax $\mathcal{O}$-monoidal functor. This allows us to relate Thom spectra to $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras of a given characteristic in the sense of Szymik. As applications, we recover the Hopkins--Mahowald theorem realizing $H\mathbb{F}_p$ and $H\mathbb{Z}$ as Thom spectra, and compute the topological Hochschild homology and the cotangent complex of various Thom spectra.</description>

      <title>Complexity and speed of semi-algebraic multi-persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{R}$ be a real closed field, $S \subset \mathrm{R}^n$ a closed and bounded semi-algebraic set, and $\mathbf{f}=(f_1,\ldots,f_p):S \rightarrow \mathrm{R}^p$ a continuous semi-algebraic map inducing a $p$-parameter semi-algebraic filtration by sublevel sets. We introduce a barcode invariant for such filtrations that directly extends the classical ($p=1$) barcode. After scaling of the parameter space, in each homological degree $\ell$ the invariant is encoded by a $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$-valued function \[ \mu_\ell(S,\mathbf{f}):\ \Big(({-}1,1)^p\times(({-}1,1)^p \cup\{(1,\ldots,1)\}) \Big)\ \cap\ \{(\mathbf a,\mathbf b)\mid \mathbf a\preceq \mathbf b\} \ \longrightarrow\ \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}, \] where $\preceq$ denotes the product order on $\mathrm{R}^p$. We prove that $\mu_\ell(S,\mathbf{f})$ is semi-algebraically constructible and establish a singly exponential upper bound on its description complexity. Moreover, we give a singly exponential-time algorithm to compute $\mu_\ell(S,\mathbf{f})$, extending to arbitrary $p$ the corresponding result for $p=1$ by Basu and Karisani. Finally, for semi-algebraic filtrations of bounded description complexity we bound the number of equivalence classes of finite poset modules realizable in this way, yielding a tight analogue of "speed" bounds for algebraically defined graph classes.</description>

      <title>A ring structure on Tor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that within a natural class of E_3-algebras, the graded Tor group induced by a span of E_3-algebra maps carries a graded algebra structure generalizing the classical structure when the algebras are genuine commutative differential graded algebras.
  We attempt to prove, as a topological corollary, that Munkholm's Eilenberg--Moore collapse result for pullbacks of spaces with polynomial cohomology can be enhanced to a ring isomorphism. This is not achieved, and in fact the claim as stated in the previous drafts is false. If additionally, 2 is assumed to be a unit of the base ring, then that claim is true (not that the results in this paper establish it) and is known due to previous work of the author and Franz, and also, as it turns out, to Huebschmann's unpublished 1983 habilitation work.</description>

      <title>Braiding vineyards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and study what we believe is an intriguing and, to the best of our knowledge, previously unknown connection between two areas in computational topology, topological data analysis (TDA) and knot theory. Given a function from a topological space to $\mathbb{R}$, TDA provides tools to simplify and study the importance of topological features: in particular, the $l^{th}$-dimensional persistence diagram encodes the $l$-homology in the sublevel set as the function value increases as a set of points in the plane. Given a continuous one-parameter family of such functions, we can combine the persistence diagrams into an object known as a vineyard, which track the evolution of points in the persistence diagram. If we further restrict that family of functions to be periodic, we identify the two ends of the vineyard, yielding a closed vineyard. This allows the study of monodromy, which in this context means that following the family of functions for a period permutes the set of points in a non-trivial way. In this work, given a link and value $l$, we construct a topological space and periodic family of functions such that the closed $l$-vineyard contains this link. This shows that vineyards are topologically as rich as one could possibly hope. Importantly, it has at least two immediate consequences: First, monodromy of any periodicity can occur in a $l$-vineyard, answering a variant of a question by [Arya et al 2024]. To exhibit this, we also reformulate monodromy in a more geometric way, which may be of interest in itself. Second, distinguishing vineyards is likely to be difficult given the known difficulty of knot and link recognition, which have strong connections to many NP-hard problems.</description>

      <title>Frequent subgraph-based persistent homology for graph classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.</description>
