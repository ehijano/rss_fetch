      <title>Mechanics-guided parametric modeling of intranasal spray devices and formulations for targeted drug delivery to the nasopharynx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the efficacy of nasal sprays by enhancing targeted drug delivery to intra-airway tissue sites prone to infection onset is hypothesized to be achievable through an optimization of key device and formulation parameters, such as the sprayed droplet sizes, spray cone angle, and formulation density. This study focuses on the nasopharynx, a primary locus of early viral entry, as the optimal target for intranasal drug delivery. 3D anatomical upper airway geometries reconstructed from high-resolution computed tomography scans were used to numerically evaluate a cone injection approach, with inert particles mimicking the motion of sprayed droplets within an underlying inhaled airflow field. We have considered monodisperse sprayed particles sized between 10 to 50 microns, six densities ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 g/ml for the constituent formulation, and twelve plume angles spanning 1 to 70 degrees subtended by the spray jet at the nozzle position. Large Eddy Simulation-based modeling of the inhaled airflow physics within the anatomical domains was coupled with a Lagrangian particle-tracking framework to derive the drug deposition trend at the nasopharynx. The resulting globally averaged deposition contour map, obtained by interpolating the outcomes for the discrete test parameters, revealed that nasopharyngeal deposition peaked for droplet sizes 25 to 45 microns and plume angles equal to or less than 30 degrees. In addition, the formulation density of 1.0 g/ml yielded the highest mean deposition rate, over the tested range of sprayed particle sizes and plume angles. The findings were experimentally validated through representative physical spray tests conducted in a 3D-printed replica of one of the test geometries and collectively demonstrate that rational optimization of the intranasal spray design is attainable, with substantial enhancement of targeted drug delivery to the nasopharynx.</description>

      <title>Airway Mucus Rheology: Physical Insights for Navigating through Health to Pathology and Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airway mucus is a complex gel with an anisotropic three-dimensional network structure. As a crucial component of the respiratory defense barrier, it plays a vital role in maintaining airway hydration and supporting the function of airway epithelial cells. Through linear and nonlinear rheological mechanisms such as ciliary motion and coughing, airway mucus expels foreign pathogens and toxic nano- and microparticles while selectively allowing the passage of specific nutrients and proteins. These protective and clearance functions depend on the proper rheological properties of mucus under normal physiological conditions. However, in respiratory disease such as CF, COPD, asthma, and COVID-19, excessive mucus secretion is often accompanied by abnormal rheological behaviors. This leads to impaired mucus flow, airway obstruction, and potentially life-threatening conditions. Therefore, this review examines the rheological behaviors of airway mucus in relation to health and disease, focusing on both macrorheology and microrheology. The review highlights those changes in the chemical composition and microstructure of airway mucus, especially under pathological conditions, that can significantly alter its rheological behavior. Rheological parameters can also serve as biological indicators to study the role of mucus in clearance functions and aid in developing pulmonary drug delivery systems. By integrating findings from both macro- and microrheological studies, this review aims to enhance our understanding of the complex behavior of airway mucus, supporting better diagnosis, treatment, and management of chronic respiratory diseases.</description>

      <title>An Advanced Two-Stage Model with High Sensitivity and Generalizability for Prediction of Hip Fracture Risk Using Multiple Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment. However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank, Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

      <title>Robust High-Resolution Multi-Organ Diffusion MRI Using Synthetic-Data-Tuned Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on, compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+ clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1) Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions (liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point scale, $p&lt;0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points (good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points (good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Sparing of DNA irradiated with Ultra-High Dose-Rates under Physiological Oxygen and Salt conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer treatment with radiotherapy aims to kill tumor cells and spare healthy tissue.Thus,the experimentally observed sparing of healthy tissue by the FLASH effect during irradiations with ultra-high dose rates (UHDR) enables clinicians to extend the therapeutic window.However, the underlying radiobiological and chemical mechanisms are far from being understood.DNA is one of the main molecular targets for radiotherapy.Ionizing radiation damage to DNA in water depends strongly on salt,pH,buffer and oxygen content of the solvent.Here we present a study of plasmid DNA pUC19,irradiated with 18MeV electrons at low dose rates (LDR) and UHDR under tightly controlled ambient and physiological oxygen conditions in PBS at pH 7.4.For the first time a sparing effect of DNA strand-break induction between UHDR(&gt;10MGy/s) and LDR(&lt;0.1Gy/s) irradiated plasmid DNA under physiological oxygen, salt and pH is observed for total doses above 10Gy.Under physiological oxygen (physoxia,5%O2,40mmHg),more single (SSB) and double strand-breaks (DSB) are observed when exposed to LDR, than to UHDR.This behaviour is absent for ambient oxygen (normoxia,21%O2,150-160mmHg).The experiments are accompanied by TOPAS-nBio based particle-scattering and chemical MCS to obtain information about the yields of reactive oxygen species (ROS).Hereby,an extended set of chemical reactions was considered, which improved upon the discrepancy between experiment and simulations of previous works, and allowed to predict DR dependent g-values of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).To explain the observed DNA sparing effect under FLASH conditions at physoxia,the following model was proposed:The interplay of O2 with OH induced H-abstraction at the phosphate backbone,and the conversion of DNA base-damage to SSB,under consideration of the dose-rate dependent H3O+ yield via beta elimination processes is accounted for, to explain the observed behavior.</description>

      <title>Label-Free Intraoperative Imaging of Hemodynamics using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intraoperative visualization of hemodynamics is crucial for accurate diagnosis and informed surgical decision-making. In neurosurgery, indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) is the gold standard for assessing blood flow and identifying vascular structures. However, it is limited by time-consuming data acquisition, mandatory waiting periods, potential allergic reactions, and operational complexities. Label-free alternatives, such as laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) and white light imaging (WLI), offer real-time vascular assessment but cannot resolve arterial-venous differentiation or blood flow direction determination. To address these challenges, we present a label-free cross-modal generation framework to synthesize mean transition time (MTT) maps from LSCI and WLI. MTT maps encode local hemodynamics, enabling artery-vein differentiation and flow direction inference. Experimental validation in rat brains demonstrates that the proposed method presents clear vasculature delineation, accurate artery-vein differentiation, and reliable blood flow direction decoding, while reducing total imaging time by 95.8% compared to conventional ICG protocols. This approach offers a fast, efficient, and contrast-free solution for continuous intraoperative surgical guidance.</description>

      <title>On the new and accurate (Goudsmit-Saunderson) model for describing e-/e+ multiple Coulomb scattering (Geant4 Technical Note)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model, for the accurate simulation of multiple Coulomb scattering (MSC) of e-/e+, has been implemented in Geant4 recently and made available with version Geant4-10.4. The model is based on Goudsmit-Saunderson (GS) angular distributions computed by utilising the screen Rutherford (SR) DCS and follows very closely the formulation developed by Kawrakow [1, 2] and utilised in the EGSnrc toolkit [3]. Corrections, for taking into accountenergy loss [2] neglected by the GS theory, spin-relativistic effects [3] not included in the SR but might be accounted on the basis of Mott DCS as well as the so-called scattering power correction [4], i.e. appropriately incorporating deflections due to sub-threshold delta ray productions, are all included similarly to the EGSnrc model [3]. Furthermore, an accurate electron-step algorithm [5, 6, 2] is utilised for path length correction, i.e. for calculating the post-step position in each condensed history simulation steps such that the corresponding single-scattering longitudinal and lateral (post step point) distributions are very well reproduced. An e-/e+ stepping algorithm, including the simulation step-limit due to the MSC and boundary crossing [2]), free from step-size artefacts, makes the model complete. Details on this new model, including all the above-mentioned components and corrections, are provided in this Geant4 technical note.
  It must be noted, that a Goudsmit-Saunderson model for MSC was available before Geant4-10.4., documented in [7], that has been completely replaced by the model described in this technical note (keeping only the G4GoudsmitSaundersonMscModel name of the C++ class from that previous version)</description>

      <title>Implicit neural representations for accurate estimation of the standard model of white matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables non-invasive investigation of tissue microstructure. The Standard Model (SM) of white matter aims to disentangle dMRI signal contributions from intra- and extra-axonal water compartments. However, due to the model its high-dimensional nature, accurately estimating its parameters poses a complex problem and remains an active field of research, in which different (machine learning) strategies have been proposed. This work introduces an estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs), which incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the input coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo datasets and compared to existing methods. Results demonstrate superior accuracy of the INR method in estimating SM parameters, particularly in low signal-to-noise conditions. Additionally, spatial upsampling of the INR can represent the underlying dataset anatomically plausibly in a continuous way. The INR is self-supervised, eliminating the need for labeled training data. It achieves fast inference, is robust to noise, supports joint estimation of SM kernel parameters and the fiber orientation distribution function with spherical harmonics orders up to at least 8, and accommodates gradient non-uniformity corrections. The combination of these properties positions INRs as a potentially important tool for analyzing and interpreting diffusion MRI data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Analysis of Neutron Wavefunction Overlap and Nuclear Interaction Probability with Carborane Cage ($^{10}$B10) in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) leverages the nuclear reaction between thermal neutrons and boron-10 (B-10) atoms to induce selective tumor cell death. The spatial and quantum mechanical overlap between the neutron wavefunction and B-10 nuclei encapsulated in carborane cages (C2B10H12) is fundamental to optimizing therapeutic efficacy. This study presents a quantum mechanical framework to evaluate the neutron-boron interaction probability by modeling neutron wavefunctions and the spatial distribution of boron atoms within the carborane cages. Using spherical harmonics and density functional theory (DFT)-derived geometries of carborane, the neutron scattering amplitudes and reaction cross sections are quantitatively analyzed. The implications of neutron spin states, nuclear magnetic moments, and external perturbations on the neutron capture probability are discussed. The computed neutron scattering amplitudes and reaction cross sections provide a basis for evaluating neutron-boron interaction probabilities under varied quantum conditions. The proposed model offers theoretical insights into molecular-level design considerations for enhancing the efficiency of BNCT.</description>
