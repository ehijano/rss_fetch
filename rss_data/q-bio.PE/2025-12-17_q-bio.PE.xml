      <title>An Improved Inverse Method for Estimating Disease Transmission Rates in Low-Prevalence Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate estimation of time-varying transmission rates is fundamental for understanding infectious disease dynamics and implementing effective public health interventions. To this end, we propose an improved inverse method for estimating time-varying transmission rates in low-prevalence settings, where conventional data preprocessing approaches often fail due to sparse case observations. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce an exponential B-spline interpolation approach that integrates both continuous and discrete inverse methods. This method ensures that transmission rate estimates remain non-negative and smooth, even when the observed data exhibit low cases. We apply this approach to several infectious disease models using real-world data from China, including a scarlet fever model, a multi-strain influenza model, and an age-structured influenza model. The results show that our method provides accurate transmission rate estimates, particularly in low-prevalence infectious diseases and multi-group epidemic models, demonstrating its robustness and applicability across various epidemiological contexts. The improved inverse method offers a new perspective for epidemiological modeling and provides reliable technical support for related theoretical exploration and public health decision-making.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Moran dynamics in continuous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how natural selection unfolds across space and time is a central problem in evolutionary biology. Classic models such as the Moran process capture stochastic birth-death dynamics in structured populations, while reaction-diffusion equations like the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equation describe deterministic wave-like spread. In this work, we bridge these perspectives by deriving partial differential equations for the spatiotemporal limit of Moran dynamics in continuous media. Our model incorporates two distinct fitness components: fecundity (birth rate) and viability (death rate). We demonstrate that the resulting selective wave speeds differ substantially in spatial Moran Birth-death (Bd), Moran Death-birth (Db), and FKPP dynamics. When fecundity drives the dynamics, we observe that the selective waves decelerate for the Bd process, whereas in the Db process the wave propagates with a higher, constant speed. In contrast, when viability drives the process, the Db wave accelerates, while the Bd and FKPP waves maintain comparable constant speeds. We extend the framework to heterogeneous media, represented as weighted lattice graphs in one or two dimensions. We derive a continuous space analog of isothermal graphs and establish that the isothermality condition corresponds to the conservation of a local current.</description>

      <title>Toric Multivariate Gaussian Models from Symmetries in a Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a rooted tree $T$ on $n$ non-root leaves with colored and zeroed nodes, we construct a linear space $L_T$ of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices with constraints determined by the combinatorics of the tree. When $L_T$ represents the covariance matrices of a Gaussian model, it provides natural generalizations of Brownian motion tree (BMT) models in phylogenetics. When $L_T$ represents a space of concentration matrices of a Gaussian model, it gives certain colored Gaussian graphical models, which we refer to as BMT derived models. We investigate conditions under which the reciprocal variety $L_T^{-1}$ is toric. Relying on the birational isomorphism of the inverse matrix map, we show that if the BMT derived graph of $T$ is vertex-regular and a block graph, under the derived Laplacian transformation, $L_T^{-1}$ is the vanishing locus of a toric ideal. This ideal is given by the sum of the toric ideal of the Gaussian graphical model on the block graph, the toric ideal of the original BMT model, and binomial linear conditions coming from vertex-regularity. To this end, we provide monomial parametrizations for these toric models realized through paths among leaves in $T$.</description>
