      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning for AVO Inversion with Strong Spatial Feature Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional convolution is a widely used deep learning technique in prestack amplitude variation with offset (AVO) inversion; however, it lacks lateral continuity. Although two-dimensional convolution improves lateral continuity, due to the sparsity of well-log data, the model only learns weak spatial features and fails to explore the spatial correlations in seismic data fully. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel AVO inversion method based on semi-supervised learning with strong spatial feature constraints (SSFC-SSL). First, two-dimensional predicted values are obtained through the inversion network, and the predicted values at well locations are sparsely represented using well-log labels. Subsequently, a label-annihilation operator is introduced, enabling the predicted values at non-well locations to learn the spatial features of well locations through the neural network. Ultimately, a two-way strong spatial feature mapping between non-well locations and well locations is achieved. Additionally, to reduce the dependence on well-log labels, we combine the semi-supervised learning strategy with a low-frequency model, further enhancing the robustness of the method. Experimental results on both synthetic example and field data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves lateral continuity and inversion accuracy compared to one- and two-dimensional deep learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Probability of earthquake fault jumps from physics based criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrical complexities in natural fault zones, such as steps and gaps, pose a challenge in seismic hazard studies as they can act as barriers to seismic ruptures. In this study, we propose a criterion, which is based on the rate-and-state equation, to estimate the efficiency of an earthquake rupture to jump two spatially disconnected faults. The proposed jump criterion is tested using a 2D quasi-dynamic numerical simulations of the seismic cycle. The criterion successfully predicts fault jumps where the coulomb stress change fails to do so. The criterion includes the coulomb stress change as a parameter but is also dependent on other important parameters among which the absolute normal stress on the fault which the rupture is to jump to. Based on the criterion, the maximum jump distance increases with decreasing absolute normal stress, i.e. as the rupture process occurs closer to the surface or as pore pressure increases. The criterion implies that an earthquake can jump to an infinite distance at the surface if the normal stress is allowed to go to zero. Thus, the properties of the surface layers are of the outmost importance in terms of maximum rupture jump distance allowed. The absolute normal stress is the main controlling parameter followed by the uncertainty on the slip of an earthquake, which controls the coulomb stress impact on the receiver fault. Finally, we also propose a method to compute probabilities of earthquakes rupture to jump, which allows to consider uncertainties in geometrical configurations between two faults.</description>

      <title>Towards Foundation Models: Evaluation of Geoscience Artificial Intelligence with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the geoscience community with deep learning models (DLMs) that are trained to complete specific tasks within workflows. This success has led to the development of geoscience foundation models (FMs), which promise to accomplish multiple tasks within a workflow or replace the workflow altogether. However, lack of robust evaluation frameworks, even for traditional DLMs, leaves the geoscience community ill prepared for the inevitable adoption of FMs. We address this gap by designing an evaluation framework that jointly incorporates three crucial aspects to current DLMs and future FMs: performance uncertainty, learning efficiency, and overlapping training-test data splits. To target the three aspects, we meticulously construct the training, validation, and test splits using clustering methods tailored to geoscience data and enact an expansive training design to segregate performance uncertainty arising from stochastic training processes and random data sampling. The framework's ability to guard against misleading declarations of model superiority is demonstrated through evaluation of PhaseNet, a popular seismic phase picking DLM, under 3 training approaches. Furthermore, we show how the performance gains due to overlapping training-test data can lead to biased FM evaluation. Our framework helps practitioners choose the best model for their problem and set performance expectations by explicitly analyzing model performance at varying budgets of training data.</description>

      <title>Completion of Lunar Magma Ocean Solidification at 4.43 Ga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystallization of the lunar magma ocean yielded a chemically unique liquid residuum named KREEP. This component is expressed as a large patch on the near side of the Moon, and a possible smaller patch in the northwest portion of the Moon's South Pole-Aitken basin on the far side. Thermal models estimate that the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) could have spanned from 10 and 200 Myr, while studies of radioactive decay systems have yielded inconsistent ages for the completion of LMO crystallization covering over 160 Myr. Here, we show that the Moon achieved over 99 percent crystallization at 4429+/-76 Myr, indicating a lunar formation age of 4450 Myr or possibly older. Using the 176Lu-176Hf decay system (t1/2=37 Gyr), we found that the initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios of lunar zircons with varied U-Pb ages are consistent with their crystallization from a KREEP-rich reservoir with a consistently low 176Lu/177Hf ratio of 0.0167 that emerged ~140 Myr after solar system formation. The previously proposed younger model age of 4.33 Ga for the source of mare basalts (240 Myr after solar system formation) might reflect the timing of a large impact. Our results demonstrate that lunar magma ocean crystallization took place while the Moon was still battered by planetary embryos and planetesimals leftover from the main stage of planetary accretion. Study of Lu-Hf model ages for samples brought back from the South Pole-Aitken basin will help to assess the lateral continuity of KREEP and further understand its significance in the early history of the Moon.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the post-spinel transition and its expression in slabs and plumes worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the interface of Earth's upper and lower mantle, the post-spinel transition boundary controls the dynamics and morphologies of downwelling slabs and upwelling plumes, and its Clapeyron slope is hence one of the most important constraints on mantle convection. In this study, we reported a new in situ experimental dataset on phase stability in Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$ at mantle transition zone pressures from laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments, along with a compilation of corrected in situ experimental datasets from the literature. We presented a machine learning framework for high-pressure phase diagram determination and focused on its application to constrain the location and Clapeyron slope of the post-spinel transition: ringwoodite $\leftrightarrow$ bridgmanite + periclase. We found that the post-spinel boundary is nonlinear and its Clapeyron slope varies locally from $-2.3_{-1.4}^{+0.6}$ MPa/K at 1900 K, to $-1.0_{-1.7}^{+1.3}$ MPa/K at 1700 K, and to $0.0_{-2.0}^{+1.7}$ MPa/K at 1500 K. We applied the temperature-dependent post-spinel Clapeyron slope to estimate its lateral variation across the "660-km" seismic discontinuity in subducting slabs and hotspot-associated plumes worldwide, as well as the ambient mantle. We found that, in the present-day mantle, the average post spinel Clapeyron slope in the plumes is three times more negative than that in slabs, and we then discussed the effects of a nonlinear post-spinel transition on the dynamics of Earth's mantle.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes enabled model calibration in the context of deep geological disposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: the mechanical behavior of emplacement drifts is essential for safety assurance. This study presents a surrogate modeling approach for the mechanical response of emplacement drifts in rock salt formations, utilizing Gaussian Processes (GPs). The surrogate model serves as an efficient substitute for high-fidelity mechanical simulations in many-query scenarios, including time-dependent sensitivity analyses and calibration tasks. By significantly reducing computational demands, this approach facilitates faster design iterations and enhances the interpretation of monitoring data. The findings indicate that only a few key parameters are sufficient to accurately reflect in-situ conditions in complex rock salt models. Identifying these parameters is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of deep geological disposal systems.</description>
