      <title>Wall Shear Stress Generated by a Bernoulli Pad: Hot-Film Anemometry and Model Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wall shear stress generated by a Bernoulli pad over a workpiece is of interest for the particular application of non-contact biofouling mitigation from ship hulls. The shear stress distribution has been determined numerically in the literature; it is directly measured experimentally for the first time in this paper. A constant temperature anemometer is used with a hot-film sensor and water as the working fluid; the sensor is calibrated using fully developed channel flow. Experiments with a Bernoulli pad accurately capture the magnitude of the maximum shear stress and its location resulting from constriction of the flow and flow separation due to sudden change in direction from axial to radial. Several numerical models are tested against the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity and recurrence in stability spectra of near-extreme Stokes waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider steady surface waves in an infinitely deep two--dimensional ideal fluid with potential flow, focusing on high-amplitude waves near the steepest wave with a 120 degree corner at the crest. The stability of these solutions with respect to coperiodic and subharmonic perturbations is studied, using new matrix-free numerical methods. We provide evidence for a plethora of conjectures on the nature of the instabilities as the steepest wave is approached, especially with regards to the self-similar recurrence of the stability spectrum near the origin of the spectral plane.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of transitions in lid-driven flows in semicircular cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, three-dimensional (3D) lid-driven flows in semicircular cavities are studied. The numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations modeling incompressible viscous fluid flow in cavities is obtained via a methodology combining a first-order accurate operator-splitting scheme, a fictitious domain formulation, and finite element space approximations. The critical Reynolds numbers (Re_{cr}) for having oscillatory flow (a Hopf bifurcation) are obtained. The associated oscillating motion in a semicircular cavity with length equal to width has been studied in detail. Based on the averaged velocity field in one period of oscillating motion, the flow difference (called oscillation mode) between the velocity field and averaged one at several time instances in such period shows almost the same flow pattern for the Reynolds numbers close to Re_{cr}. This oscillation mode in a semicircular cavity shows a close similarity to the one obtained in a shallow cavity, but with some difference in a shallow cavity which is triggered by the presence of two vertical side walls and downstream wall.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Total Variation Regularized Optimization in Fluid Dynamics and Related Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimization framework is presented for minimizing the energy functional developed around a generalized equation governing physical systems such as fluid dynamics, particle transport, phase transition, and other related systems. The convexity of the energy functional is investigated to derive the necessary conditions for a smooth and global optimum solution. Furthermore, the Total Variation (TV) regularization term is introduced to gain insights into the solution space and convergence analysis of convection-dominated problems.
  We demonstrate the practical application of our method by applying it to some selected examples such as the Boltzmann, Navier-Stokes, and Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous turbophoresis of heavy inertial particles in turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy particles suspended in turbulent flow possess inertia and are ejected from violent vortical structures by centrifugal forces. Once piled up along particle paths, this small-scale mechanism leads to an effective large-scale drift. This phenomenon, known as turbophoresis, causes particles to leave highly turbulent regions and migrate towards calmer regions, explaining why particles transported by non-homogeneous flows tend to concentrate near the minima of turbulent kinetic energy. It is demonstrated here that turbophoretic effects are just as crucial in statistically homogeneous flows. Although the average turbulent activity is uniform, instantaneous spatial fluctuations are responsible for inertial-range inhomogeneities in the particle distribution. Direct numerical simulations are used to probe particle accelerations, specifically how they correlate to local turbulent activity, yielding an effective coarse-grained dynamics that accounts for particle detachment from the fluid and ejection from excited regions through a space and time-dependent non-Fickian diffusion. This leads to cast fluctuations in particle distributions in terms of a scale-dependent P\'eclet number $Pe_l$, which measures the importance of turbulent advection compared with inertial turbophoresis at a given scale $l$. Multifractal statistics of energy dissipation indicate that $Pe_l \sim l^\delta/\tau_{\rm p}$ with $\delta\approx 0.84$. Numerical simulations support this behaviour and emphasises the relevance of the turbophoretic P\'eclet number in characterising how particle distributions, including their radial distribution function, depends on $l$. This approach also explains the presence of voids with inertial-range sizes, and the fact that their volumes has a non-trivial distribution with a power-law tail $p(V) \propto V^{-\alpha}$, with an exponent $\alpha$ that tends to 2 as $Pe_l\to0$.</description>

      <title>Cell agglomeration strategy for cut cells in eXtended discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a cell agglomeration strategy for the cut cells arising in the extended discontinuous Galerkin (XDG) method is presented. Cut cells are a fundamental aspect of unfitted mesh approaches where complex geometries or interfaces separating sub-domains are embedded into Cartesian background grids to facilitate the mesh generation process. In such methods, arbitrary small cells occur due to the intersections of background cells with embedded geometries and lead to discretization difficulties due to their diminutive sizes. Furthermore, temporal evolutions of these geometries may lead to topological changes across different time steps. Both of these issues, i.e., small-cut cells and topological changes, can be addressed with a cell agglomeration technique. In this work, a comprehensive strategy for the typical issues associated with cell agglomeration in three-dimensional and multiprocessor simulations is provided. The proposed strategy is implemented into the open-source software package BoSSS and tested with 2- and 3-dimensional simulations of immersed boundary flows.</description>

      <title>Spatially dependent node regularity in meshless approximation of partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a way to reduce the total computational cost of meshless approximation by reducing the required stencil size through spatially varying computational node regularity. Rather than covering the entire domain with scattered nodes, only regions with geometric details are covered with scattered nodes, while the rest of the domain is discretized with regular nodes. A simpler approximation can be used in regions covered by regular nodes, effectively reducing the required stencil size and computational cost compared to the approximation on scattered nodes where a set of polyharmonic splines is added to ensure convergent behaviour.
  This paper is an extended version of conference paper entitled "Spatially-varying meshless approximation method for enhanced computational efficiency" [arXiv:2303.01760] presented at "International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) 2023". The paper is extended with discussion on development and implementation of a hybrid regular-scattered node positioning algorithm (HyNP). The performance of the proposed HyNP algorithm is analysed in terms of separation distance and maximal empty sphere radius. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that HyNP nodes can be used for solving problems from fluid flow and linear elasticity, both in 2D and 3D, using meshless methods. The extension also provides additional analyses of computational efficiency and accuracy of the numerical solution obtained on the spatially-variable regularity of discretization nodes. In particular, different levels of refinement aggressiveness and scattered layer widths are considered to exploit the computational efficiency gains offered by such solution procedure.</description>

      <title>Simulating unsteady fluid flows on a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements of intermediate-scale quantum processors have triggered tremendous interest in the exploration of practical quantum advantage. The simulation of fluid dynamics, a highly challenging problem in classical physics but vital for practical applications, emerges as a good candidate for showing quantum utility. Here, we report an experiment on the digital simulation of unsteady flows, which consists of quantum encoding, evolution, and detection of flow states, with a superconducting quantum processor. The quantum algorithm is based on the Hamiltonian simulation using the hydrodynamic formulation of the Schr\"odinger equation. With the median fidelities of 99.97% and 99.67% for parallel single- and two-qubit gates respectively, we simulate the dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) compressible diverging flow and a 2D decaying vortex with ten qubits. The experimental results well capture the temporal evolution of averaged density and momentum profiles, and qualitatively reproduce spatial flow fields with moderate noises. This work demonstrates the potential of quantum computing in simulating more complex flows, such as turbulence, for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Reference map technique for Lagrangian exploration of coherent structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the application of the reference map technique, originally developed for the Eulerian simulation of solid mechanics, in Lagrangian kinematics of fluid flows. Unlike traditional methods based on explicit particle tracking, the reference map facilitates the calculation of flow maps and gradients without the need for particles. This is achieved through an Eulerian update of the reference map, which records the take-off positions of fluid particles. Using the reference map, measures of Lagrangian fluid-element deformation can be computed solely from Eulerian data, such as displacement, deformation gradient, Cauchy-Green tensor, and Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields. We first demonstrate the accuracy of FTLE calculations based on the reference map against the standard particle-based approach in a 2D Taylor-Green vortex. Then, we apply it to turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=180$ where Lagrangian coherent structures identified as ridges of the backward-time FTLE are found to bound vortical regions of flow, consistent with Eulerian coherent structures from the Q-criterion. The reference map also proves suitable for material surface tracking despite not explicitly tracking particles. This capability can provide valuable insights into the Lagrangian landscape of turbulent momentum transport, complementing Eulerian velocity-field analysis. The evolution of initially wall-normal material surfaces in the viscous sublayer, buffer layer, and log layer sheds light on the Reynolds stress-generating events from a Lagrangian perspective. Eliminating the need for tracking numerous particles, the reference map approach offers a convenient and promising avenue for future investigations into Lagrangian kinematics and dynamics of fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Integrating Discrete Sub-grid Filters with Discretization-Corrected Particle Strength Exchange Method for High Reynolds Number Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a discrete filter for subgrid-scale (SGS) model, coupled with the discretization corrected particle strength exchange (DC-PSE) method for the simulation of three-dimensional viscous incompressible flow, at high Reynolds flows. The majority of turbulence modelling techniques, particularly in complex geometries, face significant computational challenges due to the difficulties in implementing 3-D convolution operations for asymmetric boundary conditions or curved domain boundaries. In this contribution Taylor expansion is used to define differential operators corresponding to the convolution filter, so that the transfer function remains very close to the unity of sizeable displacement in wave number, making the filter a good approximation to the convolution one. A discrete Gaussian filter, in both fourth and second-order forms, was evaluated with varying ratios of particle spacing to the cut-off length. The impact of the filter's order and the ratio's value is thoroughly examined and detailed in the study. Additionally, the Brinkman penalisation technique is employed to impose boundary conditions implicitly, allowing for efficient and accurate flow simulations around complex geometries without the need for modifying the numerical method or computational domain. The incompressible flow is governed by the the he Entropically Damped Artificial Compressibility equations allowing explicit simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated through several benchmark problems, including isotropic turbulence decay, and flow around four cylinders arranged in a square in-line configuration. These test cases demonstrate the method's accuracy in capturing the intricate flow structures characteristic of high Reynolds number flows, highlighting its applicability to industrial turbulence modeling.</description>

      <title>Marangoni Interfacial Instability Induced by Solute Transfer Across Liquid-Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents analytical and numerical investigations of Marangoni interfacial instability in a two-liquid-layer system with constant solute transfer across the liquid interface. Previous research has demonstrated that both viscosity ratio and diffusivity ratio can influence the system's hydrodynamic stability via the Marangoni effect, but the distinctions in process and mechanisms are not yet fully understood. To gain insights, we developed a numerical model based on the phase-field method, rigorously validated against linear stability analysis. The parameter space explored encompasses Schmidt number ($Sc \in [0.2, 200]$), Marangoni number ($Ma_c \in [10, 2000]$), Capillary number ($Ca \in [0.01, 1]$), viscosity ratio ($\zeta_\mu \in [0.1, 10]$), and diffusivity ratio ($\zeta_D \in [0.1, 10]$). We identified two key characteristics of Marangoni instability: the self-amplification of triggered Marangoni flows in flow-intensity-unstable case and the oscillation of flow patterns during flow decay in flow-intensity-stable case. Direct numerical simulations incorporating interfacial deformation and nonlinearity confirm that specific conditions, including solute transfer out of a higher viscous or less diffusive layer, amplify and sustain Marangoni interfacial flows. Furthermore, the study highlights the role of interfacial deformation and unequal solute variation in system instability, proposing corresponding instability mechanisms. Notably, traveling waves are observed in the flow-intensity-stable case, correlating with the morphological evolution of convection rolls. These insights contribute to a comprehensive understanding of Marangoni interfacial instability in multicomponent fluids systems, elucidating the mechanisms underlying variations in viscosity and diffusivity ratios across liquid layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we fill in the blanks in the theory of drops under shear flow by unifying analytical predictions for steady-state behavior proposed by Flumerfelt [R. W. Flumerfelt, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 76, 330 (1980)] for unconfined drops with interface viscosity with the one of Shapira &amp; Haber [M. Shapira and S. Haber, Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 16, 305 (1990)] for confined drops without interface viscosity. Our predictions for both steady-state drop deformation and inclination angle are broadly valid for situations involving confined/unconfined drops, with/without interface viscosity and viscosity ratio, thus making our model so general that it can include any of the above conditions.</description>

Abstract: Magneto-inertial range dominated by magnetic helicity has been studied using results of the numerical simulations, laboratory measurements, solar, solar wind, and the Earth's and planets' magnetosphere observations (spacecraft measurements). The spectral data have been compared with the theoretical results based on the distributed chaos notion in the frames of the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology. The transition from magnetohydrodynamics to kinetics in the electron and Hall magnetohydrodynamics, and in a fully kinetic 3D approach, as well as in the solar wind, solar photosphere, and at the special events (reconnections, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, isolated flux tube interchanges, etc.) in the magnetosphere of Earth, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury has been also discussed.</description>

      <title>Combining Machine Learning with Computational Fluid Dynamics using OpenFOAM and SmartSim</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining machine learning (ML) with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) opens many possibilities for improving simulations of technical and natural systems. However, CFD+ML algorithms require exchange of data, synchronization, and calculation on heterogeneous hardware, making their implementation for large-scale problems exceptionally challenging.
  We provide an effective and scalable solution to developing CFD+ML algorithms using open source software OpenFOAM and SmartSim. SmartSim provides an Orchestrator that significantly simplifies the programming of CFD+ML algorithms and a Redis database that ensures highly scalable data exchange between ML and CFD clients. We show how to leverage SmartSim to effectively couple different segments of OpenFOAM with ML, including pre/post-processing applications, solvers, function objects, and mesh motion solvers. We additionally provide an OpenFOAM sub-module with examples that can be used as starting points for real-world applications in CFD+ML.</description>

Abstract: To integrate wave and sediment transport modeling, a computationally extensive wave-resolving Voronoi mesh-based simulation has been developed to improve upon heretofore separate sediment and spectral wave modeling. Orbital wave motion-dependent sediment transport and fine structures of the dynamic Rouse number distribution across the seabed were brought into focus. The entirely parallelized wave-resolving hydrodynamic model is demonstrated for nearshore beach waters adjacent to artificial islands in Doha Bay. The nested model was validated with tidal time series for three locations and two seasons.</description>
