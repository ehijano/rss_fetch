      <title>Coupling Self-Dual p-Form Gauge Fields to Self-Dual Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $d=4k+2$ dimensions, $p$-form gauge fields (with $p=2k$) with self-dual field strengths couple naturally to dyonic branes with equal electric and magnetic charges. Sen's action for a $p$-form gauge field with self-dual field strength coupled to a spacetime metric $g$ involves an explicit Minkowski metric; however, this action can be generalised to provide a theory in which the Minkowski metric is replaced by a second metric $\bar g$ on spacetime. This theory describes a physical sector, consisting of the chiral $p$-form gauge field coupled to the dynamical metric $g$, plus an auxiliary sector consisting of a second chiral $p$-form and the second metric $\bar g$. The fields in this auxiliary sector only couple to each other and have no interactions with the physical sector. However, in this theory, the standard coupling to a brane given by integrating the gauge potential over the world-volume of the brane is problematic as the physical gauge potential depends non-locally on the fields appearing in the action. A consistent coupling is given by introducing Dirac branes (generalising Dirac strings), and is shown to have generalised symmetries corresponding to invariance under deforming the positions of the Dirac branes, provided the Dirac branes do not intersect any physical brane world-volumes.</description>

      <title>Holographic thread game, kinematic space and quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a holographic ``thread game", which visually represents quantum entanglement with thread-like objects, based on some natural assumptions. By studying their trajectories in the holographic bulk, we ultimately find that these threads should correspond precisely to perfect geodesics in the bulk, making kinematic space a tailor-made language for describing the thread game. Furthermore, it turns out that the thread game has a quantum circuit interpretation, where each thread plays the role of a wire. Therefore, kinematic space can be regarded as the ``input board" of the holographic quantum circuit characterizing the entanglement structure of the spacetime. Based on this understanding, we also present a nice explanation of holographic complexity in the language of kinematic space.</description>

      <title>Renormalized charged scalar current on a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in the presence of charge superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized charge current for a massless, minimally coupled, charged quantum scalar field on a charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole space-time, using the method of pragmatic mode-sum renormalization. Since the field exhibits superradiance, we consider the past Unruh, Boulware and Candelas-Chrzanowski-Howard states, and study how the renormalized current in these states depends on the charges of the black hole and scalar field. We also study the backreaction of the charge current on the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Splitting CEGM Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CEGM formalism offers a general framework for scattering amplitudes, which rests on Grassmannians, moduli spaces and tropical geometry. The physical implications of this generalization are still to be understood. Conventional wisdom says that key features of scattering amplitudes, like factorization at their poles into lower-point amplitudes, are associated to their singularities. The factorization behavior of CEGM amplitudes at their poles is interesting but complicated. Recent developments have revealed important properties of standard particle and string scattering amplitudes from factorizations, known as splits, that happen away from poles. In this paper we introduce a kinematic subspace on which the CEGM amplitude splits into very simple rational functions. These functions, called simplex amplitudes, arise from stringy integrals for the multivariate beta function, and also from restricting the biadjoint scalar amplitude in quantum field theory to certain kinematic loci. Using split kinematics we also discover a specific class of zeros of the CEGM amplitude. Our construction rests on viewing positive moduli space as a product of simplices, and it suggests a novel approach for deriving scattering amplitudes from tropical determinantal varieties.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Entanglement of Purification and Half R\'enyi Reflected Entropy in Free Scalar Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT context, the entanglement of purification (EoP) of CFT is conjectured to be dual to the entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) in bulk. However, another quantity called reflected entropy $S_{R}$ is also supposed to be dual to two times the EWCS. A natural question is whether they are the same in holographic CFTs even though they are different in general. Previous studies have shown $\mathrm{EoP} \ge \frac{1}{2} S_{R}^{n}, n \ge2$ for random tensor networks. In this paper, we study this inequality beyond $n \ge 2$, and we focus on the range $0 &lt; n &lt; 2$. However, the calculations of EoP are notoriously difficult in general. Thus, our calculations mainly focus on the free scalar theory which is close to the holographic CFTs. We generalized the previous strategy for EoP in \cite{Takayanagi:2018sbw} to the R\'enyi case. And we have also presented two methods for R\'enyi reflected entropy, one is using correlators, the other one is Gaussian wavefunction ansatz. Our calculations show that the inequality still holds for $0 &lt; n &lt; 2$, and it may give us some insights into the equivalence of EoP and half reflected entropy in holographic CFTs. As byproducts of our research, we have also demonstrated the positivity of the R\'enyi Markov gap and the monotonicity of the R\'enyi reflected entropy in the free scalar theory.</description>

      <title>Carrollian superstring in the flipped vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the spectrum of the Carrollian superstring in the flipped vacuum (the highest-weight representation) in detail. The target spacetime of the Carrollian string has a generalized Carrollian symmetry, and it is composed of both Poincar\'e directions and Carrollian directions. We explicitly show that two homogeneous Carrollian superstring theories, one with compactified Poincar\'e direction and the other with compactified Carrollian direction, share the same BMS$_3$ symmetry, and their zero modes can be identified under the usual T-duality transformation. Moreover, we investigate the spectrum of a general Carrollian superstring in the flipped vacuum. As the string can still have nonvanishing winding along the spatial direction in the infinite radius limit, the spectrum of the Carrollian strings in the flat background is no longer truncated. We furthermore construct the vertex operators of gravitons and discuss their scattering amplitudes. We find that the form of 3-point amplitudes differs from that of the usual tensile superstrings only by a simple function, which reflects the ultra-local nature of Carrollian physics.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic stability and phase structure of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both canonical ensemble and grand canonical ensemble, the thermodynamic stability and phase structure of Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black hole are studied. We derive the Hawking temperature, Helmholtz free energy, Gibbs potential, entropy and heat capacity of the black holes. We compute the minimum temperature to find that the phase transition may happen at the lowest point. The entropy-temperature diagram consists of two parts. The upper part belonging to the large black holes under the influence from the electromagnetic self-interactions keeps the positive heat capacity, leading the huge compact objects to survive. The lower curves corresponding to the small ones show that the heat capacity of the tiny black holes is negative, which means that the nonlinear-effect-corrected smaller sources will evaporate. The further discussions show that the nonlinear effect modifies the thermodynamic quantities, but the corrections limited by the nonlinear factor $\mu$ with allowed values can not change the properties and the phase structure fundamentally and thoroughly. We argue that the influence from self-interaction can not make the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg-AdS black holes to split under the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Direct Expression for One-Loop Tensor Reduction with Lorentz Indices via Generating Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, we derived a direct expression for one-loop tensor reduction using generating functions and Feynman parametrization in projective space, avoiding recursive relations. However, for practical applications, this expression still presents two challenges: (1) While the final reduction coefficients are expressed in terms of the dimension D and Mandelstam variables, the given expression explicitly contains irrational functions; (2) The expression involves an auxiliary vector R, which can be eliminated via differentiation $\frac{\partial}{\partial R}$, but the presence of irrational terms making differentiation cumbersome. (3) Most practical applications require the tensor form with Lorentz indices.
  In this paper, we provide a rational form of the reduction coefficients with Lorentz indices, free from recursion. Additionally, We provide a pure Wolfram Mathematica implementation of the code. Our practical tests demonstrate that this direct expression achieves significantly higher computational efficiency compared to the traditional Passarino-Veltman (PV) reduction or other recursion-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the subtraction approach, we give the bipartite mixed state entanglement entropy in thermal $\text{CFT}_2$. With these entanglement entropies, we examine a proposed phase transition of entanglement wedge cross section derived from the perspective of bulk investigation in the literature. We clarify the proposed phase transition is an illusion caused by confusion between different configurations. In the thermofield double state, we show a horizon-crossing feature in two-sided entanglement configuration.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an on-shell ${\mathcal N}=3$ nonlinear multiplet coupled to conformal supergravity and use it to formulate the equations of motion for ${\mathcal N} = 3$ Poincar\'e supergravity. These equations, which are naturally described in a new curved supergeometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, imply that the ${\mathcal N} = 3$ super-Bach tensor vanishes, and thus every solution of Poincar\'e supergravity is a solution of conformal supergravity. The aforementioned superspace formulation, which we refer to as $\mathcal N=3$ Einstein superspace, is described in terms of two dimension-$1/2$ superfields: (i) the super-Weyl spinor $W_\alpha$; and (ii) a spinor isospinor $\chi_\alpha^i$.</description>

      <title>A Supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}$ Symmetry, the Extended Supergravity and the Celestial Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric $W_{1+\infty}^{2,2}[\lambda=\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra which is an extension of ${\cal N}=4$ $SO(4)$ superconformal algebra with vanishing central charge. We identify the soft current algebra between the graviton, the gravitinos, the vectors, the Majorana fermions, the scalar or the pseudoscalar, equivalent to ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}^{2,2}[\lambda=\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra, in two dimensions with the ${\cal N}=4$ supergravity theory with $SO(4)$ global symmetry in four dimensions found by Das (at Stony Brook in 1977), via celestial holography. Furthermore, the truncations of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}^{2,2}[\lambda=\frac{1}{4}]$ algebra provide the soft current algebras for the ${\cal N}=2,3$ supergravity theories, the ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity coupled to its Abelian vector multiplet and the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Maxwell Einstein theory. For the ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity theory, the soft current algebra can be also realized by the ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric $w_{1+\infty}^{K,K}[\lambda=0]$ algebra.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes, Modular Entropy, and Capacity of Entanglement in JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing the replica trick we study the impact of the replica parameter $n$ on the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in the End of the World (EoW) model and the island model, respectively. For the EoW model, we present $n$-dependent evolution curves of the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement under both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. In particular, in the canonical ensemble, all quantities decrease as $n$ increases at late times. For the island model, we develop the replica geometry for finite $n$ and re-evaluate the modular entropy and the capacity of entanglement in a two-sided eternal Jackiw-Teitelboim black hole coupled with a thermal bath. In the case of a single island configuration, the modular entropy and capacity of entanglement closely resemble the thermal entropy and the heat capacity, respectively, yielding results analogous to those obtained in the canonical ensemble for the EoW model. The analysis of the results from these two models strongly indicates that in geometries with a greater number of $n$ copies, more connected geometries effectively purify thermal Hawking radiation. In addition, we compare these findings with statistical mechanics and provide an interpretation for the replica parameter $n$. Finally, we generalize the island formula to accommodate the finite $n$ case under this interpretation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT) in Minkowski spacetime, we study the spacetime distance between two events along two distinct modular trajectories. When the spatial line is bipartite by a single interval, we consider both the ground state and the state at finite different temperatures for the left and right moving excitations. For the free massless Dirac field in the ground state, the bipartition of the line given by the union of two disjoint intervals is also investigated. The modular flows corresponding to connected subsystems preserve relativistic causality. Locality along the modular flows of some fields is explored by evaluating their (anti-)commutators. In particular, the bilocal nature of the modular Hamiltonian of two disjoint intervals for the massless Dirac field provide multiple trajectories leading to Dirac delta contributions in the (anti-)commutators even when the initial points belong to different intervals, thus being spacelike separated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) background in energy regularization of global structures in (2, 1) dimensions. To this end, we consider a model, in which the complex scalar and fixed three-vector couple as a high derivative order term. We show that LIV-background does not affect the stability of the energy of neutral global structures. However, we observe that the charged structures are sensitive to LIV-background by presenting signatures in the electric field whose intensity is controlled by the LIV-parameter. Furthermore, we show that the presented procedure is capable of regularizing the energies of the electric field and of charged configurations.</description>

      <title>Boundary Quantum Field Theories Perturbed by ${\rm T}\bar{\rm T}$: Towards a Form Factor Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of irrelevant perturbations of integrable quantum field theories has greatly expanded over the last decade. In particular, we know that, from a scattering theory viewpoint at least, their effect is realised as a modification the two-body scattering amplitudes by a CDD factor. While this sounds like a relatively small change, this CDD factor incorporates a non-trivial dependence on the perturbation parameter(s) and alters substantially the high-energy physics of the model. This occurs through the introduction of a natural length scale and is associated with phenomena such as the Hagedorn transition. In this paper we discuss how all these features extend to boundary integrable quantum field theories and propose a construction for the building blocks of matrix elements of local fields. We show that the same type of building blocks are also found in the sinh-Gordon model with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>The 3d $A$-model and generalised symmetries, Part I: bosonic Chern-Simons theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3d $A$-model is a two-dimensional approach to the computation of supersymmetric observables of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In principle, it allows us to compute half-BPS partition functions on any compact Seifert three-manifold (as well as of expectation values of half-BPS lines thereon), but previous results focussed on the case where the gauge group $\widetilde G$ is a product of simply-connected and/or unitary gauge groups. We are interested in the more general case of a compact gauge group $G=\widetilde G/\Gamma$, which is obtained from the $\widetilde G$ theory by gauging a discrete one-form symmetry. In this paper, we discuss in detail the case of pure $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons theories (without matter) for simple groups $G$. When $G=\widetilde G$ is simply-connected, we demonstrate the exact matching between the supersymmetric approach in terms of Seifert fibering operators and the 3d TQFT approach based on topological surgery in the infrared Chern-Simons theory $\widetilde G_k$, including through the identification of subtle counterterms that relate the two approaches. We then extend this discussion to the case where the Chern-Simons theory $G_k$ can be obtained from $\widetilde G_k$ by the condensation of abelian anyons which are bosonic. Along the way, we revisit the 3d $A$-model formalism by emphasising its 2d TQFT underpinning.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets from higher $SU(N)$ representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for deriving the thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of "atoms" carrying an arbitrary irreducible representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through long-range two-body quadratic interactions. Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems of atoms with reduced symmetry in their interactions compared to the fundamental case.</description>

      <title>Ricci-Flat Mirror Hypersurfaces in Spaces of General Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Ricci-flat (i.e., Calabi-Yau) hypersurfaces in spaces admitting a maximal (toric) $U(1)^n$ gauge symmetry of general type (encoded by certain non-convex and multi-layered multitopes) may degenerate, but can be smoothed by rational (Laurent) anticanonical sections. Nevertheless, the phases of the Gauged Linear Sigma Model and an increasing number of their classical and quantum data are just as computable as for their siblings encoded by reflexive polytopes, and they all have transposition mirror models. Showcasing such hypersurfaces in so-called Hirzebruch scrolls shows this class of constructions to be infinitely vast, yet amenable to standard and well-founded algebro-geometric methods of analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two extra dimensions of micron scale might simultaneously address the gauge and cosmological hierarchy problems. In our paper we examine various observational bounds in scenarios with one and two large extra dimensions, to see if they are compatible with the micron scale. We show that consistency with astrophysical and cosmological observations requires that two extra dimensions of micron scale must not admit isometries, whereby conservation of the extra dimensional momentum is violated to a large extent, allowing thus the massive Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton to promptly decay to other lighter graviton modes. We also show that within this scenario primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^8 \leq M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \leq 10^{21}$ could make all cosmological dark matter.</description>

      <title>Black holes in thermal bath live shorter: implications for primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hawking radiation from a non-extremal black hole is known to be approximately Planckian. The thermal spectrum receives multiple corrections including greybody factors and due to kinematical restrictions on the infrared and ultraviolet frequencies. We show that another significant correction to the spectrum arises if the black hole is assumed to live in a thermal bath and the emitted radiation gets thermalised at the bath temperature. This modification reshapes the thermal spectrum, and leads to appreciable deviation from standard results including modification in the decay rate of black holes. We argue that this altered decay rate has significance for cosmology and, in a realistic setting, show that it alters the life time of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe. In particular, the very light PBHs formed right after the end of inflation decay faster which may have interesting phenomenological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss string theory methods for the study of strongly coupled holographic defect conformal field theories (CFTs) which are dual to probe-brane systems. First, we examine whether the string theory duals of such defect CFTs are classically integrable. This amounts to identifying all string boundary conditions on probe branes which preserve the integrability of the underlying Green-Schwarz sigma model. Second, we compute holographic defect correlation functions with semiclassical strings. After reviewing the computation of three and higher-point functions in strongly coupled AdS/CFT, and one-point functions in its probe-brane descendants, we outline the computation of two and higher-point correlation functions in strongly coupled defect CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical dynamics of particles with (non-)abelian charges and spin moving on curved manifolds is established in the Poisson-Hamilton framework. Equations of motion are derived for the minimal quadratic Hamiltonian and some extensions involving spin-dependent interactions. It is shown that these equations of motion coincide with the consistency conditions for current and energy-momentum conservation. The classical equations cannot be derived from an action principle without extending the model. One way to overcome this problem is the introduction of anticommuting Grassmann co-ordinates. A systematic derivation of constants of motion based on symmetries of the background fields is presented.</description>

      <title>Dressed Subsystems in Classical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of consistently defining subsystems in gravitational theories. It is argued that a subsystem is a spacetime subregion in which the observables form a closed Poisson algebra. In a generally covariant theory, the location of the subregion must be determined in relation to other degrees of freedom. It is proposed that these degrees of freedom should live within the region, so that an observer can determine its edge by only measuring fields inside of it. This turns out to be equivalent to the property that observables in the subregion generate field-dependent gauge transformations on the causal complement. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this is \textit{exactly} what is necessary for the observables to form a Poisson algebra and thus to constitute a consistent subsystem. Observables in spacelike separated "dressed subsystems" are shown to commute. Several examples are given in the context of General Relativity. Along the way, new perspectives on the covariant phase space formalism are introduced that clarify well-known issues, such as the factorization of subregions in gauge theories and the unambiguous definition of Noether charges associated with one-sided boosts. Finally, prospects for extending these results to a perturbative quantum setting are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The utility of the non-relativistic large-charge EFT for physical systems, and neutron matter in particular, relies on controlled Schr\"odinger-symmetry breaking deformations due to scattering length and effective-range effects in the two-body system. A recently-found exact solution of the large-charge system is used to compute these effects for two-point correlation functions of large-charge operators in perturbation theory around the large-charge ground state. Notably, the leading effective-range effects are found to enter at second order in the effective range, in agreement with analogous calculations in the three-body system. The Schr\"odinger-symmetry breaking deformations are used -- together with input from Quantum Monte Carlo simulations -- to address the range of validity of the EFT with deformations both in general and in the special case of neutron matter. In particular, it is found that nuclear reactions with up to six low-energy neutrons in the final state can be described by the large-charge EFT with Schr\"odinger-symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>The role of the chiral anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering III: Wess-Zumino-Witten contributions and chiral Ward identities for finite quark mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our prior results on the worldline computation of the axial vector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) to the finite mass case by computing in addition the pseudoscalar-vector-vector (PVV) triangle graph. For the well-studied QED case, we show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical PVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral condensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the massless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a primordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\bar \eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten coupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical $\eta^\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by $O(10\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic expression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that the proton's net quark helicity $\Delta \Sigma\propto \sqrt{\chi_{\rm QCD}' |_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral limit, and show they are of the order of a few percent. Our prior prediction that the polarized DIS structure function $g_1$ is quenched by sphaleron-like topological transitions at small $x$ is unaffected by quark mass effects. Our results illustrate how worldline computations of anomalous processes, in synergy with lattice computations and nonet chiral perturbation theory, can uncover novel nonperturbative features of QCD at the Electron-Ion collider.</description>

      <title>Non-linear equation of motion for higher curvature semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the non-linear semiclassical equation of motion for a general diffeomorphism-invariant theory of gravity by leveraging the thermodynamic properties of closed causal horizons. Our work employs two complementary approaches. The first approach utilizes perturbative quantum gravity applied to a Rindler horizon. The result is then mapped to a stretched light cone, which can be understood as a union of Rindler planes. Here, we adopt the semiclassical physical process formulation, encapsulated by $\langle Q\rangle = T \delta S_{gen}$ where the heat-flux $\langle Q\rangle$ is related to the expectation value of stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$ and $S_{gen}$ is the generalized entropy. The second approach introduces a "higher curvature" Raychaudhuri equation, where the vanishing of the quantum expansion \(\Theta\) pointwise as required by restricted quantum focusing establishes an equilibrium condition, \(\delta S_{\text{gen}} = 0\), at the null boundary of a causal diamond. While previous studies have only derived the linearized semiclassical equation of motion for higher curvature gravity, our work resolves this limitation by providing a fully non-linear formulation without invoking holography.</description>

Abstract: We study non-local operators for analyzing the Higgs-confinement phase transition in lattice gauge theory. Since the nature of the Higgs-confinement phase transition is topological, its order parameter is the expectation value of non-local operators, such as loop and surface operators. There exist several candidates for the non-local operators. Adopting the charge-2 Abelian Higgs model, we test numerical simulation of conventional ones, the Polyakov loop and the 't Hooft loop, and an unconventional one, the Aharonov-Bohm phase defined by the Wilson loop wrapping around a vortex line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The logarithmic Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence is a conjectural equivalence between braided tensor categories of representations of small quantum groups and representations of certain vertex operator algebras.
  In this article we prove such an equivalence, and more general versions, using mainly algebraic arguments that characterize the representation category of the quantum group by quantities that are accessible on the vertex algebra side. Our proof is conditional on suitable analytic properties of the vertex algebra and its representation category. More precisely, we assume that it is a finite braided rigid monoidal category where the Frobenius-Perron dimensions are given by asymptotics of analytic characters.</description>

      <title>Staggered Fermions with Chiral Anomaly Cancellation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the shift, time reversal and phase symmetries of Hamiltonian staggered fermions and their connection to continuum symmetries concentrating in particular on the case of massless fermions and (3+1) dimensions. We construct operators using the staggered fields that implement these symmetries on finite lattices. We show that it is possible to build shift symmetries that commute with time reversal by combining the elementary shifts with the phase symmetry. In general these symmetries do not form a mutually commuting set and the system suffers from 't Hooft anomalies. However, in the case where the phase symmetry is broken to $Z_4$ by four fermion interactions we find that these lattice anomalies cancel. The naive continuum limit of this anomaly free lattice model has the symmetries and matter representations of the Pati-Salam GUT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A magnetic field above the Schwinger critical value $B_{\rm crit} = 10^9$ Tesla is much higher than any magnetic field known by now in the interstellar bulk except in the vicinity of observed magnetars with magnetic fields between $10^9$ and $10^{11}~$Tesla. Above the critical magnetic field, calculated by Schwinger in the lowest order perturbation in quantum electrodynamics (QED), one reaches the threshold for electron-positron pair creation, which has interesting consequences. Therefore, finding out whether one could encounter some consequences of interest also for the values of the magnetic field below the Schwinger critical point, we invoke the next higher-order effect in QED, which is emerging from the Quantum Vacuum Effect. The latter is equivalent to the use of the Euler-Heisenberg effective theory in nonlinear electrodynamics, where the Lagrangian has a term with a higher power, $B^4$. In this case, in the region $B&lt;B_{\rm crit}$, we show that interesting effects appear, among them the Cherenkov radiation and the reduction in the speed of light. The latter effects appear because of the quantum vacuum mimicking a medium. We also present quantitative arguments for such a close analogy. As a rough estimate, we show that the time delay $\tau$ of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) having traveled through the entire cosmological distances in an average strong magnetic field such as $10^6~$Tesla, reaches an experimentally considerable value of $\tau = 2.4$ hours. In the vicinity of magnetars, the magnetic field is much stronger, of the order of $10^9-10^{11}$ Tesla. However, in this case the linear scale of GRB trajectory through such regions would be much smaller. For the latter, we give an estimate for the number of the magnetars along the trajectory and also for the delay. Finally, we shall dwell on the recently raised issue in the literature, namely the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the classical aspects of Quantum theory and under which description Quantum theory does appear Classical. Although such descriptions or variables are known as "ontological" or "hidden", they are not hidden at all, but are dual classical states (in the sense of the general classical-quantum duality of Nature). The application of the Minimal Group Representation immediately classicalizes the system, Mp(2) emerging as the group of the classical-quantum duality symmetry. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Center vortices and the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ conformal window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach for estimating the lower end of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ conformal window is presented through the study of center vortex geometry and its dependence on the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Values ranging from $N_f = 2$--$8$ are utilized to infer an upper limit for vortex behavior in the low $N_f$ phase, which may inform the transition to the conformal window. The simulations are performed at a single lattice spacing and pion mass, both fixed for all $N_f$. Visualizations of the center vortex structure in three-dimensional slices of the lattice reveal a growing roughness in the vortex matter as a function of $N_f$, embodied by an increase in the density of vortex matter in the percolating cluster and a simultaneous reduction in secondary clusters disconnected from the percolating cluster in 3D slices. This is quantified by various bulk properties, including the vortex and branching point densities. A correlation of the vortex structure reveals a turning point near $N_f \simeq 5$ past which a randomness in the vortex field becomes the dominant aspect of its evolution with $N_f$. As a byproduct, extrapolations to the vortex content of a uniform-random gauge field provide a critical point at which there must be a drastic shift in vacuum field structure. A precise estimate for the critical value is extracted as $N_f^* = 11.43(16)(17)$, close to various other estimates.</description>

      <title>Exploring the universal $\bar{\mathcal{I}}-\mathcal{C}$ relations for relativistic stars in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of neutron stars within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity by incorporating rotational effects through a slowly rotating metric, extending previous work. We derive the modified TOV equations and calculate the angular velocity profiles and moments of inertia for linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and exponential $f(Q)$ models. Our results show that deviations in the moment of inertia are more pronounced than those in the maximum mass, providing a strong constraint for alternative gravity theories. We also find a universal relation between the dimensionless moment of inertia and compactness, which shows distinct deviations from GR in $f(Q)$ models. Additionally, we analyze hybrid and quark star EoS, demonstrating consistency with the behavior observed in the calculation of the $\bar{I}-C$ relation for PSR J0737-3039A, which could be explored further and is interesting for future studies. Our findings suggest that $f(Q)$ gravity offers the possibility of being tested in the strong-field regime by examining the properties of compact objects and constraining the $f(Q)$ parameters through universal relations, such as the $I-C$ relation, in potential future observations.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Curvature Perturbations via Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict an enhancement of scalar perturbations at scales currently unconstrained by cosmological probes. These perturbations source gravitational waves (GWs) at second order in perturbation theory, leading to a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background. The LISA detector, sensitive to mHz GWs, will be able to constrain curvature perturbations in a new window corresponding to scales $k \in [10^{10}, 10^{14}] \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, difficult to probe otherwise. In this work, we forecast the capabilities of LISA to constrain the source of SIGWs using different approaches: i) agnostic, where the spectrum of curvature perturbations is binned in frequency space; ii) template-based, modeling the curvature power spectrum based on motivated classes of models; iii) ab initio, starting from first-principles model of inflation featuring an ultra-slow roll phase. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also discuss the impact on the SIGW spectrum of non-standard thermal histories affecting the kernels of SIGW emission and non-Gaussianity in the statistics of the curvature perturbations. Finally, we propose simple tests to assess whether the signal is compatible with the SIGW hypothesis. The pipeline used is built into the SIGWAY code.</description>

      <title>Improving thermal state preparation of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with reinforcement learning on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, known for its strong quantum correlations and chaotic behavior, serves as a key platform for quantum gravity studies. However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems (N&gt;12, where N is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems N&gt;10 compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work contributes to the advancement of a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for computations of thermal out-of-time-order correlators in quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity studies on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A Conjecture of Warnaar-Zudilin from Deformations of Lie Superalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a collection of $q$-series identities conjectured by Warnaar and Zudilin and appearing in recent work with H. Kim in the context of superconformal field theory. Our proof utilizes a deformation of the simple affine vertex operator superalgebra $L_k(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2n})$ into the principal subsuperspace of $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_{1|2n+1})$ in a manner analogous to earlier work of Feigin-Stoyanovsky. This result fills a gap left by Stoyanovsky, showing that for all positive integers $N$, $k$ the character of the principal subspace of type $A_N$ at level $k$ can be identified with the (super)character of a simple affine vertex operator (super)algebra at the same level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for relating the transition rate of an accelerated Unruh-deWitt detector to the rate of the same detector when stationary in Minkowski space. Furthermore, we show that when using the detector as a model for decay, its transition rate can be related directly to the decay rate obtained from QFT. Combined this provides a straightforward method for calculating the decay rate of accelerated particles to first order in the coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Responses of Generalized Landau Levels: Structure Factor and the Quantized Hall Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new geometric characterization of generalized Landau levels (GLLs). The GLLs are a generalization of Landau levels to non-uniform Berry curvature, and are mathematically defined in terms of a holomorphic curve -- an ideal K\"ahler band -- and its associated unitary Frenet-Serret moving frame. Here, we find that GLLs are harmonic maps from the Brillouin zone to the complex projective space and they are critical points of the Dirichlet energy functional, as well as the static structure factor up to fourth order. We also find that filled GLLs exhibit quantized Hall viscosity, similar to the ordinary Landau levels. These results establish GLLs as a versatile generalization of Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Rule Out Heavy Tachyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present direct observational constraints on tachyons; particles with group velocity greater than $c$ in vacuum in a Lorentz invariant theory. Since tachyons may have no direct couplings to Standard Model particles, the most robust and model independent constraints come from gravitational effects, especially black holes. We compute the Hawking radiation of tachyons from black holes, finding it to be significantly enhanced in the presence of heavy tachyons. For a black hole of mass $M$ and tachyons of mass $m$ with $g$ degrees of freedom, the black hole lifetime is found to be $t_{bh} \approx 192 \pi \hbar M/(g c^2 m^2)$ (or doubled for fermions). This implies that the observation of black holes of a few solar masses, with lifetime of several billion years, rules out tachyons of mass $m &gt; 3 \times 10^9$ GeV. This means there cannot exist any tachyons associated with unification scales or quantum gravity. So while there already exists theoretical reasons to be skeptical of tachyons, our work provides a complementary direct observational constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the first step to explore the nonlinear dynamics of an extra dimension in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spacetime with black objects through numerical relativity, we generate time-symmetric initial data of a black string and/or a KK bubble with space-dependent compactification radius. The initial data developed in this paper are classified into three types. First, we present analytic initial data with SO(3) symmetry whose three-dimensional section is spherically symmetric. These initial data include a black string without a KK bubble, a black string trapping a KK bubble, and a naked KK bubble. Second, we present analytic initial data for multiple black strings with varying compactification radius, which is a natural generalization of the Brill-Lindquist initial data for four-dimensional general relativity. Finally, we develop a numerical method for generating the initial data with a black string and a KK bubble located at different positions, which would be useful in simulating what happens when an expanding KK bubble meets black objects in dynamical context.</description>

      <title>Exact path integrals on half-line in quantum cosmology with a fluid clock and aspects of operator ordering ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform $\textit{exact}$ half-line path integral quantization of flat, homogeneous cosmological models containing a perfect fluid acting as an internal clock, in a $D+1$ dimensional minisuperspace setup. We also discuss certain classes of operator ordering ambiguity inherent in such quantization procedures and argue that a particular ordering prescription in the quantum theory can preserve two symmetries, namely arbitrary lapse rescalings and general covariance, which are already present at the classical level. As a result of this imposition, a large class of quantum Hamiltonians differing by operator ordering produces the same inner products between quantum states. This imposition of the two symmetries of the classical minisuperspace models leads to a unique prescription for writing the quantum Hamiltonian for minisuperspace dimension $D\geq 2$. Interestingly, in the case of $D=1$, the lapse rescaling symmetry is lost in the quantum theory, leading to an essentially ambiguous description of the canonical theory. We provide general proof of this in the context of both canonical quantization and path integrals. We supply concrete examples to validate our findings further.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Gravitational Waves on a Geometric Condensate background of $(R + \alpha R^{2})$ Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new paradigm for cosmology: a time dependent scalar condensate background originated from the quadratic $(R + \alpha R^2)$ Starobinski model, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\alpha$ the coupling constant. In weak gravity limit the system decouples into a conventional graviton and a higher derivative scalar. It was shown earlier through works from our group, \cite{ssg,sg,us}, that the latter can sustain an oscillatory lowest energy configuration or a {\it{Geometric Condensate}} as it consists entirely of metric degrees of freedom. In the present work, we study Gravitational Wave propagation in this condensate background. We show that the explicit time dependent nature of the condensate can generate curvature and radiation-like contributions in the scale factor evolution in FLRW cosmology. Subsequently the condensate leaves its signature on the Gravitational Wave profile as it propagates in the condensate modified FLRW spacetime. The wave profile is calculated analytically in terms of Whittaker functions. The main novelty of the Geometric Condensate scheme is that no external (condensate) matter from outside has been considered.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Cardoso and Nat\'ario [6] constructed an exact solution of Einstein-scalar field equations that describes a scalar counterpart of the Schwarzschild-Melvin Universe. In fact, this solution belongs to a more general class of solutions described by Herdeiro in [7]. In this work we show how to further generalize these solutions in presence of rotation and various charges. More specifically, we describe the general charged rotating black holes with NUT charge and present some of their properties.</description>

Abstract: In the QCD instanton vacuum, the C-even and C-odd nucleon Pauli form factors receive a large contribution from the underlying ensemble of pseudoparticles, that is sensitive to a finite QCD vacuum angle $\theta$. This observation is used to derive explicitly the electric dipole form factor for light quark flavors, and estimate the proton and neutron electric dipole moment induced by a small CP violating $\theta$. The results are in the range of some recently reported lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Trace-free Einstein gravity as a constrained bigravity theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trace-free Einstein gravity is a prominent alternative to general relativity, which has two versions: one in which the energy-momentum conservation is assumed a priori and another in which it is not. In the first version, the cosmological constant arises as an integration constant. We report two diffeomorphism-invariant actions for trace-free Einstein gravity in which the energy-momentum conservation emerges directly from the equations of motion. The first action is based on the metric, while the second action is based on the tetrad and connection where the conservation of the energy-momentum holds if torsion vanishes. To achieve this, auxiliary fields but otherwise dynamical are introduced in the corresponding actions, which have the form a constrained bigravity theory. These results constitute a significant advance in our understanding of trace-free Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Trace-free Einstein gravity as two interacting constrained $BF$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of gravity alternative to general relativity is trace-free Einstein gravity, which has the remarkable property that the cosmological constant emerges as an integration constant. In this paper, we report two fully diffeomorphism-invariant actions for trace-free Einstein gravity. They describe the theory as two $BF$ theories supplemented with some constraints. The first action comprises two copies of the constrained $BF$ theory for the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model plus an interaction term involving the fields that impose the constraints on the $B$ fields. The second action employs two copies of the chiral Plebanski action for general relativity plus an additional constraint. Both actions use complex variables, and naturally include one of the reality conditions imposed in the Plebanski formulation of general relativity. The new actions have the advantage of not involving any nondynamical fields or unimodular condition, and their only gravitational sector is trace-free Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Modified gravitational wave propagations in linearized gravity with Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations and their gravitational wave constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard model extension (SME) is an effective field theory framework that can be used to study the possible violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance in the gravitational interaction. In this paper, we explore both the Lorentz- and diffeomorphism-violating effects on the propagations of gravitational waves in the SME's linearized gravity. It is shown that the violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance modify the conventional linear dispersion relation of gravitational waves, leading to anisotropy, birefringence, and dispersion effects in the propagation of gravitational waves. With these modified dispersion relations, we then calculate the dephasing effects due to the Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations in the waveforms of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of compact binaries. With the distorted waveforms, we perform full Bayesian inference with the help of the open source software \texttt{BILBY} on the gravitational wave events of the compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalogs GWTC-3. We consider the effects from the operators with the lowest mass dimension $d=2$ and $d=3$ due to the Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations in the linearized gravity. No signature of Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations arsing from the SME's linearized gravity are found for most GW events, which allows us to give a $90\%$ confidence interval for each Lorentz- and diffeomorphism-violating coefficient.</description>

      <title>Quantum trajectories and Page-curve entanglement dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions in vacuum, and (ii) where both the system and the reservoir are subjected to dephasing and thereby enabling us to address how the entanglement between the part of the effectively interacting system and its complement evolves in time. We consider two different kinds of quantum trajectory approaches, namely stochastic unitary unraveling and quantum state diffusion. For both protocols, we observe and characterize the full Page curve-like dynamics for the entanglement entropy. Depending on the protocol and the setup, we observe very distinct characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page value. We also compute the number of fermions leaking to the reservoir and the associated current and shed light on their plausible connections with entanglement entropy. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide variety of generic interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient PINNs: Multi-Head Unimodular Regularization of the Solutions Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning framework to facilitate the solution of nonlinear multiscale differential equations and, especially, inverse problems using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This framework is based on what is called multihead (MH) training, which involves training the network to learn a general space of all solutions for a given set of equations with certain variability, rather than learning a specific solution of the system. This setup is used with a second novel technique that we call Unimodular Regularization (UR) of the latent space of solutions. We show that the multihead approach, combined with the regularization, significantly improves the efficiency of PINNs by facilitating the transfer learning process thereby enabling the finding of solutions for nonlinear, coupled, and multiscale differential equations.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Scalar Effects Beyond Dimension-6 in SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) provides a robust framework for probing deviations in the couplings of Standard Model particles from their theoretical predictions. This framework relies on an expansion in higher-dimensional operators, often truncated at dimension-six. In this work, we compute the effective dimension-eight operators generated by integrating out heavy scalar fields at one-loop order in the Green's basis within two extended scalar sector models: the Two Higgs Doublet Model and the Complex Triplet Scalar Model. We also investigate the impact of heavy scalar fields on the fermion sector, deriving the fermionic effective operators up to dimension eight for these models, and detail how contributions can be mapped onto non-redundant bases. To assess the importance of higher-order contributions in the SMEFT expansion, we analyze the dimension-eight effects for electroweak precision observables at the next frontier of precision lepton machines such as GigaZ.</description>

      <title>Boundary Curvature Scalars on Conformally Compact Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a sequence of conformally invariant scalar curvature quantities, defined along the conformal infinity of a conformally compact (CC) manifold, that measure the failure of a CC metric to have constant negative scalar curvature in the interior, i.e. its failure to solve the singular Yamabe problem. Indeed, these "CC boundary curvature scalars" compute canonical expansion coefficients for singular Yamabe metrics. Residues of their poles yield obstructions to smooth solutions to the singular Yamabe problem and thus, in particular, give an alternate derivation of generalized Willmore invariants. Moreover, in a given dimension, the critical CC boundary scalar characterizes the image of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the singular Yamabe problem. We give explicit formulae for the first five CC boundary curvature scalars required for a global study of four dimensional singular Yamabe metrics, as well as asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On AdS black holes in two-dimensional dilaton gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two novel analytic AdS black hole solutions in a two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory with two scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity. Our solutions contain two arbitrary integration constants in the blackening factor $f(r)$, allowing for an extremal configuration. Solution I reproduces a previously reported AdS black hole when one of the integration constants in $f(r)$ vanishes. For our black hole configurations, the scalar curvature is constant and negative, corresponding to the $AdS_2$ spacetime. In order to elucidate their black hole nature, we explore the causal structure of these solutions with the aid of suitable Kruskal-like coordinates and Penrose diagrams. By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi method, we construct a boundary counter-term that renders a renormalized action with a vanishing variation. We use this finite action for the partition function in the semi-classical approximation. We establish a consistent Thermodynamics, verified by the first law, for our black hole solutions, including the extremal case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the thermal equilibration of the holographic QCD model dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) gravity in the presence of an external electric field. The model captures the QCD features at finite temperature and finite chemical potential in both confinement and deconfinement phases and could be considered a good candidate to study the dynamics of the strongly interacting system in out-of-equilibrium conditions. For this purpose, we examine the instability imposed by an external electric field using the AdS/CFT dictionary and study the electric current flow and its relaxation for this holographic model. We study the effects of temperature, electric field strength, and chemical potential on the current flow of the stationary state by applying a constant electric field. Additionally, for a time-dependent electric field, we investigate the relaxation time scales of the system using equilibration time. Finally, we compare our results with those from other holographic models and experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the supergravity solutions for 1/4-BPS intersecting systems of M2 and M5 branes are completely characterized by a single ``maze'' function that satisfies a non-linear ``maze'' equation similar to the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We also show that the near-brane limit of certain intersections are $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3$ solutions warped over a Riemann surface, $\Sigma$. There is an extensive literature on these subjects and we construct mappings between various approaches and use brane probes to elucidate the relationships between the M2-M5 and AdS systems. We also use dualities to map our results onto other systems of intersecting branes. This work is motivated by the recent realization that adding momentum to M2-M5 intersections gives a supermaze that can reproduce the black-hole entropy without ever developing an event horizon. We take a step in this direction by adding a certain type of momentum charges that blackens the M2-M5 intersecting branes. The near-brane limit of these solutions is a BTZ$^{extremal} \times S^3 \times S^3 \times \Sigma$ geometry in which the BTZ momentum is a function of the Riemann surface coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct highest weight vectors of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k+1} \oplus \mathsf{Vir}$ in tensor products of highest weight modules of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k}$ and ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,1}$, and thus for generic weights we find the decomposition of the tensor product into irreducibles of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k+1} \oplus \mathsf{Vir}$. The construction uses Wakimoto representations of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k}$, but the obtained vectors can be mapped back to Verma modules. Singularities of this mapping are cancelled by a renormalization. A detailed study of ``degenerations'' of Wakimoto modules allowed to find the renormalization factor explicitly. The obtained result is a significant step forward in a proof of equivalence of certain two-dimesnional CFT models.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we derive the singular condition for black holes and demonstrate the potential resolution of the black hole singularity in general relativity using non-perturbative $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections of string theory. This work is motivated by the Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) proposal, which suggests that the structure of the black hole interior in vacuum Einstein's equations can be transformed into the Kasner universe near the singularity. This transformation allows for the description of the black hole interior using the $O\left(d,d\right)$ invariant anisotropic Hohm-Zwiebach action, which includes all orders of $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the subleading structure of asymptotically-flat spacetimes and its relationship to the $w_{1+\infty}$ loop algebra of higher spin charges. We do so using both the Bondi-Sachs and the Newman-Penrose formalism, via a dictionary built from a preferred choice of tetrad. This enables us to access properties of the so-called higher Bondi aspects, such as their evolution equations, their transformation laws under asymptotic symmetries, and their relationship to the Newman-Penrose and the higher spin charges. By studying the recursive Einstein evolution equations defining these higher spin charges, we derive the general form of their transformation behavior under BMSW symmetries. This leads to an immediate proof that the spin 0,1 and spin $s$ brackets reproduce upon linearization the structure expected from the $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We then define renormalized higher spin charges which are conserved in the radiative vacuum at quadratic order, and show that they satisfy for all spins the $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra at linear order in the radiative data.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant acts as the thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate as the thermodynamic volume, we analyze the phase structure and thermodynamic geometry of the three-dimensional quantum-corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. Our results uncover two-phase transitions in the $T-S$ plane across all pressures except at a critical value. Numerical analysis reveals continuous critical phenomena along the coexistence curve, with critical exponents of 2 and 3 for the heat capacity at constant pressure and the NTG curvature, respectively. Importantly, these values notably deviate from the well-known critical exponents observed in mean-field Van der Waals (VdW) fluids, where the NTG curvature and heat capacity demonstrate discontinuous criticality. To our knowledge, our investigation is the first exploration of critical behavior in black holes incorporating consistent semiclassical backreaction.</description>

      <title>Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of $2d$ sigma models which are parameterized by a function of one variable. In addition to the physical field $g$, these models include an auxiliary field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every theory in this family is classically integrable, in that it possesses an infinite set of conserved charges in involution, which can be constructed from a Lax representation for the equations of motion. This class includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <title>Vacuum transitions with the Gauss-Bonnet term in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper [1,2], we proposed a probabilistic argument to explain the reason why the cosmological constant is very small in $4D$. We can ask a question: if the behavior of tunneling exponent $B$ can be generalized to $D$-dimension. Moreover, in higher dimensional theory motivated by string theory the Gauss-Bonnet term plays an important role. Therefore, in this paper, we generalize our result in [1,2] to arbitrary $D$ dimensions including the Gauss-Bonnet term. As a result, we have two main results. We find that the Euclidean action of the bounce, $B$, describing the decay of a de Sitter vacuum, is proportional to $k^{-(D-2)}_{+}$, which has a pole as $k^2_{+} \rightarrow 0$ where $k^2_{+}$ is the curvature of the parent vacuum. This result is similar to the result in $4D$. The other result is that we find a new decay channel, describing up-tunneling from anti-de Sitter into de Sitter. The meaning of this new decay channel in the string landscape should be explored in the future.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We found new solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation describing the superposition of chromomagnetic vortices of oppositely oriented magnetic fluxes. These gauge field configurations have constant energy densities and are separated by potential barriers forming a complicated landscape. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of chromomagnetic vortices and represent a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. In the presence of an Abelian field and in a particular limit the solutions reduce to the flat connections of zero energy density and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. A possible tunnelling transition between these superfluxon flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index will wash out the CP violating $\theta$ angle to zero, dynamically restoring CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>CFT Phase Transition Analysis of Charged, Rotating Black Holes in $D=4$: A Holographic Thermodynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic thermodynamics of 4-D Kerr-Newman AdS black holes, focusing on the conformal thermal states that are dual to these black holes. We explore the thermodynamic behavior within specific ensembles characterized by fixed sets of variables: $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p,C)$, and $(\varphi,\Omega,p,C)$. Here, $\varphi$, $\mathcal{Q}$, $\Omega$, $\mathcal{J}$, $p$, $\mathcal{V}$, and $C$ represent the electric potential, electric charge, angular velocity, angular momentum, CFT pressure, CFT volume, and central charge, respectively. The inclusion of both charge and momentum significantly enriches the regime of phase transitions, leading to a variety of phenomena including first-order Van der Waals-type phase transitions, (de)confinement phase transitions, Davies-type phase transitions, and second-order superfluid $\lambda$-type phase transitions. Notably, the introduction of the CFT pressure variable allows us to identify phase transitions and critical behavior in the $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p,C)$ and $(\varphi,\Omega,p,C)$ ensembles, which had not been previously observed. This study underscores the complexity and richness of phase transitions in these systems due to the inclusion of both charge and angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of fermions at local equilibrium: Second-order gradient expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the spin polarization of spin-1/2 fermions in a relativistic fluid at local thermodynamic equilibrium at the second order in the gradient expansion, including second-order derivatives. The second-order derivative terms vanish if the local equilibrium hypersurface is the hyperplane $t=const$ in the collision center-of-mass frame. However, since the freeze-out hypersurface has a non-trivial space-time structure, these terms may result in a non-vanishing contribution to the spin polarization, whose magnitude needs to be assessed with numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Godel Theorems on Third Quantized Theories Like String Field Theory and Group Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation that spacetime and quantum fields on it have to be dynamically produced in any theory of quantum gravity implies that quantum gravity should be defined on the configuration space of fields rather than spacetime. Such a theory is described on the configuration space of fields rather than spacetime, which is a third quantized theory. So, both string theory and group field theory are third-quantized theories. Thus, using axioms of string field theory, we motivate similar axioms for group field theory. Then, using the structure of these axioms for string field theory and group field theory, we identify general features of axioms for any such third quantized theory of quantum gravity. Thus, we show that such third-quantized theories of quantum gravity can be formulated as formal axiomatic systems. We then analyze the consequences of G\"odel theorems on such third quantized theories. We thus address problems of consistency and completeness of any third quantized theories of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Unitarization of the one-loop graviton-graviton scattering amplitudes and study of the graviball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the graviton-graviton scattering amplitudes calculated perturbatively in quantum gravity to the one-loop order, we develop further a formalism that allows one to calculate infrared-finite partial-wave amplitudes fulfilling perturbative unitarity. As a result of this process a parameter dubbed $\ln a$ emerges that separate between infrared and typical external momenta. The resulting partial-wave amplitudes are next unitarized by employing the Inverse Amplitude Method and the algebraic-$N/D$ method. Then, the graviball resonance, with a similar pole position, is confirmed in the $S$-wave partial-wave amplitude for all unitarization methods, also with respect to the unitarization of only the leading-order amplitude. Although the spectrum of the theory is independent of the specific value of $\ln a$, the requirement for a well-behaved unitarized effective field theory of gravity identifies the optimal range of $\ln a$ for our next-to-leading-order calculations as $0.5 \lesssim \ln a \lesssim 1.7$. Briefly, we discuss the $D$-wave scattering that is weaker than the $S-$wave scattering, repulsive and non-resonant for $\ln a\approx 1$.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in IIA string theory, we have found only two models that accurately account for all standard model fermion masses and mixings. The models are dual to each other under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors and feature 12 adjoint scalars, the maximum number allowed in the landscape, whose linear combination yields the two light Higgs eigenstates. Dirac neutrino-masses in normal ordering $(50.4,~10.5,~6.2)\pm 0.1$ meV satisfying both the experimental as well as swampland constraints.</description>

      <title>BTZ Black Hole In The Non-Extensive Generalizations of Gibbs Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01149v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics and thermodynamic geometry of the (2+1) dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli(BTZ) black hole within the framework of the non-extensive generalizations of Gibbs entropy. We investigate both the rotating (R-BTZ) and the charged (C-BTZ) BTZ black holes in these non-extensive entropy formalisms. We write down the Bekenstein-Hawking(BH) entropy of the black hole in terms of the non-extensive entropies namely: Kaniadakis entropy, Renyi entropy and Barrow entropy. We investigate their impact on the thermodynamic phase structure and geometry of the BTZ black holes in both the ensembles i.e. the fixed $(J)$ and fixed $(\Omega)$ ensemble for the R-BTZ black hole and the fixed $(Q)$ and the fixed $(\Phi)$ ensemble for the C-BTZ black hole where $ J$, $\Omega$, $Q$ and $\Phi$ represent the angular momentum, angular velocity, charge and the electric potential of the respective black holes . We investigate the Ruppeiner and geometrothermodynamic(GTD) geometries of the black hole for all the non-extensive entropy cases. We find that there are Davies type along with Hawking-Page phase transitions in both the charged and rotating BTZ black hole for the Kaniadakis entropy case in all the above mentioned thermodynamic ensembles. These phase transitions were not seen in the BH entropy case. We also find that the Ruppeiner and the GTD scalar for the Kaniadakis entropy show curvature singularities corresponding to the Davies type phase transitions in both the rotating and charged BTZ black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, our aim is to illustrate that the process of open string scattering corresponds to the evolution of the entanglement wedge, where the scattering distance is identified as the entanglement wedge cross section. Moreover, open-closed string scattering, specifically the disk-disk interaction, works for the evolution of the reflected entanglement wedge, with the circumference of the waist cross section equating to the reflected entropy. It therefore provides evidence for the deep connections between the string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. This connection is not only a coincidence rooted in hyperbolic geometry; it also reflects an additional correspondence between two distinct theories: mutual information and the geometric BV master equation.</description>

Abstract: A recent evaluation of three-loop nonplanar Feynman integrals contributing to Higgs plus jet production has established their dependence on two novel symbol letters. We show that the resulting alphabet is described by a $G_2$ cluster algebra, enlarging the $C_2$ cluster algebra found to cover all previously known integrals relevant for this process. The cluster algebra connection we find reveals new adjacency relations, which significantly reduce the function space dimension of the non-planar triple ladder integral. These adjacencies may be understood in part by embedding $G_2$ inside higher-rank cluster algebras.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, there is a huge progress in understanding the black hole information problem, and the key is that the black hole entropy of radiation should be calculated by the island formula, which describes the Page curve to ensure the unitarity of black hole evaporation. In the paper, we find that the black hole evaporation interpreted by the island formula can be understood in the language of approximate quantum error correction. Furthermore, the Page transition, as a special property of the Page curve, should be understood as the property of approximate quantum error correction itself, i.e. a general class of quantum systems under certain conditions from approximate quantum error correction can also exhibit phenomenon similar to the Page transition.</description>

      <title>Deformation of Matrix Geometry via Landau Level Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for the construction of deformed matrix geometries using Landau models. The Landau models are practically useful tools to extract matrix geometries. The level projection method however cannot be applied straightforwardly to the Landau models on deformed manifolds, as they do not generally exhibit degenerate energy levels. We overcome this problem by exploiting the idea of spectral flow. Taking a symmetric matrix geometry as a reference point of the spectral flow, we evolve the matrix geometry by deforming the Landau model. In this process, unitarity is automatically preserved. The explicit matrix realization of the coordinates is derived mechanically even for a non-perturbative deformation. We clarify basic properties of the deformed matrix geometries through a concrete analysis of the non-relativistic and relativistic Landau models on expanding two-sphere and elongating ellipsoid. The obtained ellipsoidal matrix geometries show behaviors quantitatively different in each Landau level, but qualitatively similar to their classical counterpart. We also numerically investigate the differences between the ellipsoidal matrix geometry and the fuzzy ellipsoid.</description>

      <title>Backreacted Coulomb energy in the Skyrme model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Skyrme model is extended with the Maxwell action and a source term for the gauge field. We consider the specialized case of vanishing isospin states, such that only an electric potential is turned on and study the backreaction onto the Skyrme fields. In particular, we study Skyrmions with baryon numbers B=4,8,12,16 and 40. We find, in agreement with physical expectations, that the Coulomb backreaction is most pronounced for large Skyrmions and find furthermore that the dynamics of the theory is more sensitive to the backreaction than the ground states (global minimizers of the energy). Calibrating the model to Carbon-12, we find excellent agreement of the masses of the studied Skyrmions - within 1.86% of experimental data. The Coulomb energies are slightly larger than phenomenological fits suggest, but only by about 3-22%, whereas the radii are within 15% errors, with the largest errors on the smallest baryon number (B=4) and the smallest errors on the large baryon numbers.</description>

      <title>A Note on $T\bar{T}$ Deformations and Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The irrelevant composite operator $T\bar{T}$, constructed from components of the stress-energy tensor, exhibits unique properties in two-dimensional quantum field theories and represents a distinctive form of integrable deformation. Significant progress has been made in understanding the bulk aspects of the theory, including its interpretation in terms of coordinate transformations and its connection to topological gravity models. However, the behavior of $T\bar{T}$-deformed theories in the presence of boundaries and defects remains largely unexplored. In this note, we review analytical results obtained through various techniques. Specifically, we study the $T\bar{T}$-deformed exact g-function within the framework of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz and show that the results coincide with those obtained by solving the corresponding Burgers-type flow equation. Finally, we highlight some potentially significant open problems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Duality Symmetry in a 3D Field-Theoretic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the discrete duality symmetry between the Abelian 1-form and 2-form basic gauge fields in the context of a three (2 + 1)-dimensional (3D) combined system of the field-theoretic model for the combined system of the free Abelian 1-from and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism where the classical gauge-fixed Lagrangian density of this theory is generalized to its quantum counterpart as the BRST and co-BRST invariant Lagrangian density. We show clearly the existence of the off-shell nilpotent (co-)BRST symmetry transformations and establish their intimate connection through a set of underlying discrete duality symmetry transformations in our BRST-quantized theory. We provide the mathematical basis for the existence of the discrete duality symmetry transformations in our theory through the Hodge duality operator (that is defined on the 3D flat Minkowskian spacetime manifold). We briefly mention a bosonic symmetry transformation which is constructed from the anticommutator of the above off-shell nilpotent (co-)BRST symmetry transformations. We lay emphasis on the algebraic structures of the existing continuous and discrete duality symmetry transformations in our theory (where they are treated as operators).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on previous works, in this article we systematically analyze the implications of the explicit normal modes of a probe scalar sector in a BTZ background with a Dirichlet wall, in an asymptotically AdS-background. This is a Fuzzball-inspired geometric model, at least in an effective sense. We demonstrate explicitly that in the limit when the Dirichlet wall approaches the event horizon, the normal modes condense fast to yield an effective branch cut along the real line in the complex frequency plane. In turn, in this approximation, quasi-normal modes associated to the BTZ black hole emerge and the corresponding two-point function is described by a thermal correlator, associated with the Hawking temperature in the general case and with the right-moving temperature in the extremal limit. We further show, analytically, that the presence of a non-vanishing angular momentum non-perturbatively enhances this condensation. The consequences are manifold: {\it e.g.}~there is an emergent {\it strong thermalization} due to these modes, adding further support to a quantum chaotic nature associated to the spectral form factor. We explicitly demonstrate, by considering a classical collapsing geometry, that the one-loop scalar determinant naturally inherits a Dirichlet boundary condition, as the shell approaches the scale of the event horizon. This provides a plausible dynamical mechanism in the dual CFT through a global quench, that can create an emergent Dirichlet boundary close to the horizon-scale. We offer comments on how this simple model can describe salient features of Fuzzball-geometries, as well as of extremely compact objects. This also provides an explicit realization of how an effective thermal physics emerges from a non-thermal microscopic description, within a semi-classical account of gravity, augmented with an appropriate boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fefferman-Graham gauge and boundary Weyl structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, the Fefferman--Graham (FG) gauge offers a useful way to express asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces, allowing a clear identification of their boundary structure. A known feature of this approach is that choosing a particular conformal representative for the boundary metric breaks explicitly the boundary scaling symmetry. Recent developments have shown that it is possible to generalize the FG gauge to restore boundary Weyl invariance by adopting the Weyl--Fefferman--Graham gauge. In this paper, we focus on three-dimensional gravity and study the emergence of a boundary Weyl structure when considering the most general AdS boundary conditions introduced by Grumiller and Riegler. We extend the holographic renormalization scheme to incorporate Weyl covariant quantities, identifying new subleading divergences appearing at the boundary. To address these, we introduce a new codimension-two counterterm, or corner term, that ensures the finiteness of the gravitational action. From here, we construct the quantum-generating functional, the holographic stress tensor, and compute the corresponding Weyl anomaly, showing that the latter is now expressed in a full Weyl covariant way. Finally, we discuss explicit applications to holographic integrable models and accelerating black holes. For the latter, we show that the new corner term plays a crucial role in the computation of the Euclidean on-shell action.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Comments on firewalls in JT gravity with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two discussions of firewalls in JT gravity. First we present an alternative, arguably simpler, derivation of the gray hole conjecture, applying uniformly to all probes of the firewall probability previously discussed. This derivation is based on the wormhole shortening picture using the handle-disk geometry. However we modifies Saad's story utilizing a "Wilsonian" effective gravitational description, adapted to the time scale probed, in which high frequency modes are integrated out generating the gravitational bulk geometries (dual to the genus expansion in the matrix integral side) whereas low frequency modes are more precisely resolved by being represented as eigenvalue D-branes where JT universes can end. This treatment results in an effective "twist factor cutoff" prescription which simplifies the discussion of long time quantities including the firewall probability. In the second part we discuss effects of matter loops on the firewall probability. While such effects lead to new firewall sources, we argue that these matter loop contributions are sub-dominant at late times.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of heterotic $G_2$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compactifications of the heterotic string, to first order in the $\alpha'$ expansion, on manifolds with integrable $G_2$ structure give rise to three-dimensional ${\cal N} = 1$ supergravity theories that admit Minkowski and AdS ground states. As shown in arXiv:1904.01027, such vacua correspond to critical loci of a real superpotential $W$. We perform a perturbative study around a supersymmetric vacuum of the theory, which confirms that the first order variation of the superpotential, $\delta W$, reproduces the BPS conditions for the system, and furthermore shows that $\delta^2 W=0$ gives the equations for infinitesimal moduli. This allows us to identify a nilpotent differential, and a symplectic pairing, which we use to construct a bicomplex, or a double complex, for the heterotic $G_2$ system. Using this complex, we determine infinitesimal moduli and their obstructions in terms of related cohomology groups. Finally, by interpreting $\delta^2 W$ as an action, we compute the one-loop partition function of the heterotic $G_2$ system and show it can be decomposed into a product of one-loop partition functions of Abelian and non-Abelian instanton gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry as a gauge theory of gravity: covariant equations of motion &amp; conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Weyl conformal geometry as a general gauge theory of the Weyl group (of Poincar\'e and dilatations symmetries) in a manifestly Weyl gauge covariant formalism in which this geometry is (automatically) metric and physically relevant. This gives a realistic (quadratic) gauge theory of gravity, with Einstein-Hilbert gravity and a (positive) cosmological constant recovered in its spontaneously broken phase. For the most general action we compute the manifestly Weyl gauge covariant equations of motion and present the conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and Weyl gauge current. These laws are valid both in Weyl conformal geometry (with respect to the Weyl gauge covariant derivative) but also in the Riemannian geometry equivalent picture (with respect to its associated covariant derivative). This interesting result is a consequence of (gauged) diffeomorphism invariance of the former versus usual diffeomorphism invariance of the latter. These results are first derived for $d=4$ dimensions and are then extended to conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions while automatically maintaining manifest Weyl gauge invariance/covariance. The results are useful in physical applications with this symmetry.</description>

      <title>Brane Cosmology from AdS/BCFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the time-dependent dynamics of an end-of-the-world (EOW) brane in AdS with a scalar field localized on the brane. We mainly studied several aspects of holography and cosmology. Standard requirements in the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ lead to a constraint on the conformal dimension in the dS$_d$/CFT$_{d-1}$. We also prove a time-like analog of g-theorem using the null energy condition in the context of AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$. In the cosmological interpretation, we rewrite the equation of motion of the brane as a Friedman-like equation, which enables us to consider its dynamics in analogy with the ordinal cosmology. And then we classify all possible solutions of the brane when the potential takes a constant value. We find that our brane cosmology model can describe a process of creating a universe via a big-bang. Additionally, we show that when the brane is close to a hyperplane, its effective action is given by a Liouville gravity with a scalar field matter. Finally, we also obtain brane solutions with boost symmetry, which are obtained by analytical continuation of Euclidean branes with a torus topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As was shown in arXiv:2303.15207, the leading large $N$, fixed $k$ correction in the localization result for the expectation value of the $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS circular Wilson loop in $U(N)_{k}\times U(N)_{-k}$ ABJM theory given by the $(\sin\frac{2\pi}{ k})^{-1}$ factor can be reproduced on the dual M-theory side as the one-loop correction in the partition function of an M2 brane in AdS$_{4}\times S^{7}/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ with AdS$_{2}\times S^{1}$ world volume. Here we prove, following the suggestion in arXiv:2408.10070, that the analogous fact is true also for the corresponding correction $B_1=-\frac{1}{2\pi k}\cot\frac{2\pi}{k}$ in the localization result for the Bremsstrahlung function associated with the Wilson line with a small cusp in either AdS$_4$ or $\rm CP^3$. The corresponding M2 brane is wrapped on the 11d circle and generalizes the type IIA string solution in AdS$_{4}\times \rm CP^3$ ending on the cusped line. We show that the one-loop term in the M2 brane partition function reproduces the localization expression for $B_1$ as the coefficient of the leading term in its small cusp expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuing our program of deriving aspects of celestial holography from string theory, we extend the Roiban-Spradlin-Volovich-Witten (RSVW) formalism to celestial amplitudes. We reformulate the tree-level maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) celestial leaf amplitudes for gluons in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory and for gravitons in $\mathcal{N}=8$ Supergravity in terms of minitwistor wavefunctions. These are defined as representatives of cohomology classes on the minitwistor space $\mathbf{MT}$, associated to the three-dimensional Euclidean anti-de Sitter space. In this framework, celestial leaf amplitudes are expressed as integrals over the moduli space of minitwistor lines. We construct a minitwistor generating functional for MHV leaf amplitudes using the Quillen determinant line bundle, extending the approach originally developed by Boels, Mason and Skinner. Building on this formalism, we propose supersymmetric celestial conformal field theories (CFTs) as $\sigma$-models, where the worldsheet is given by the celestial supersphere $\mathbf{CP}^{1|2}$, and the target space is the minitwistor superspace $\mathbf{MT}^{2|\mathcal{N}}$. We demonstrate that the semiclassical effective action of these $\sigma$-models reproduces the MHV gluonic and gravitational leaf amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and $\mathcal{N}=8$ Supergravity. This construction provides a concrete realisation of the supersymmetric celestial CFT framework recently introduced by Tropper (2024).</description>

      <title>Signatures of electromagnetic and sound radiation produced by gravitational waves in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.08312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the scenario that gravitational waves, generated in core-collapse of a pre-supernova star, can produce both electromagnetic radiation and sound radiation as gravitational waves propagate outward from the collapsing core. While the energy of this co-produced electromagnetic and sound radiation is orders of magnitude smaller than the initiating gravitational radiation, the power may be sufficient to re-ignite fusion outside the collapsing core. The non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion, in roughly the same time frame as the strongest neutrino emissions, would change the configuration of the pre-supernova star and subsequently the ejecta and the evolution of the stellar expansion of the supernova remnant. Although the co-produced electromagnetic or sound radiation could not contribute directly to the supernova explosion, the associated non-equilibrium re-ignition of fusion would alter the state outside the core leaving an observable signature in the ejecta of the supernova remnant. The aim of this paper is to argue that including this hypothesized co-produced radiation in computational models of core collapse supernovae would contribute to the evolution of the stellar expansion and consequently should be observable in the supernovae remnant, providing a confirmation of the conversion processes for gravitational radiation to electromagnetic and sound radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of dipole cosmology framework put forward in \cite{Krishnan:2022qbv}, a beyond FLRW setting that has a preferred direction in the metric which may be associated with a cosmological tilt, a cosmic dipole. In this setup the shear and the tilt can be positive or negative given the dipole direction. We thoroughly analyze evolution of the universe in this setting, particularly focusing on the behaviour near the Big Bang (BB). We first analyze a single fluid model with a generic constant equation of state $w$. While details of the behavior near the BB depends on $w$ and the other initial conditions, we find that when the shear is negative we have a shear dominated BB singularity, whereas for a positive shear we have a much milder singularity, the whimper singularity \cite{Ellis:1974ug}, at which the tilt blows up while curvature invariants remain finite. We then consider dipole $\Lambda$CDM model which besides the shear has two tilt parameters, one for radiation and one for the pressureless matter. For positive (negative) shear we again find whimper (curvature) singularity near the BB. Moreover, when the tilt parameters have opposite signs, the shear can change sign from negative to positive in the course of evolution of the Universe. We show that the relative tilt of the radiation and the matter generically remains sizable at late times.</description>

      <title>Quantum spectrum and Gamma structures for quasi-homogeneous polynomials of general type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of general type and $&lt;J&gt;$ be the cyclic symmetry group of $W$ generated by the exponential grading element $J$. We study the quantum spectrum and asymptotic behavior in Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory of the Landau-Ginzburg pair $(W, &lt;J&gt;)$.
  Inspired by Galkin-Golyshev-Iritani's Gamma conjectures for quantum cohomology of Fano manifolds, we propose Gamma conjectures for Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory of general type. We prove the quantum spectrum conjecture and the Gamma conjectures for Fermat homogeneous polynomials and the mirror simple singularities.
  The Gamma structures in Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory also provide a bridge from the category of matrix factorizations of the Landau-Ginzburg pair (the algebraic aspect) to its analytic aspect. We will explain the relationship among the Gamma structures, Orlov's semiorthogonal decompositions, and the Stokes phenomenon.</description>

      <title>White Paper and Roadmap for Quantum Gravity Phenomenology in the Multi-Messenger Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity has long been elusive. Only recently have empirical predictions of various possible theories of quantum gravity been put to test, where a clear signal of quantum properties of gravity is still missing. The dawn of multi-messenger high-energy astrophysics has been tremendously beneficial, as it allows us to study particles with much higher energies and travelling much longer distances than possible in terrestrial experiments, but more progress is needed on several fronts.
  A thorough appraisal of current strategies and experimental frameworks, regarding quantum gravity phenomenology, is provided here. Our aim is twofold: a description of tentative multimessenger explorations, plus a focus on future detection experiments.
  As the outlook of the network of researchers that formed through the COST Action CA18108 ``Quantum gravity phenomenology in the multi-messenger approach (QG-MM)'', in this work we give an overview of the desiderata that future theoretical frameworks, observational facilities, and data-sharing policies should satisfy in order to advance the cause of quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Log topological recursion through the prism of $x-y$ swap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new concept of logarithmic topological recursion that provides a patch to topological recursion in the presence of logarithmic singularities and prove that this new definition satisfies the universal $x-y$ swap relation. This result provides a vast generalization and a proof of a very recent conjecture of Hock. It also uniformly explains (and conceptually rectifies) an approach to the formulas for the $n$-point functions proposed by Hock.</description>

      <title>Disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and a precursor of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems, such as those with disorder or external kick terms, despite their large $N$ behavior differing from that of typical chaotic systems. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the microscopic origin of the negative pressure produced by the constant energy density of the vacuum. It is shown that the zero-point photons in the quantum vacuum could generate the pressures of this type in confined spaces for the photon field. We find in particular that an anomalous radiation plays a role in the occurrence of a negative pressure from the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Universality of the Penrose Limit of Black Hole Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of photon rings in a wide range of axisymmetric black holes admitting a separable Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesics. Utilizing the Killing-Yano tensor, we derive the Penrose limit of the black holes, which describes the physics near the photon ring. The obtained plane wave geometry is directly linked to the frequency matrix of the massless wave equation, as well as the instabilities and Lyapunov exponents of the null geodesics. Consequently, the Lyapunov exponents and frequencies of the photon geodesics, along with the quasinormal modes, can be all extracted from a Hamiltonian in the Penrose limit plane wave metric. Additionally, we explore potential bounds on the Lyapunov exponent, the orbital and precession frequencies, in connection with the corresponding inverted harmonic oscillators and we discuss the possibility of photon rings serving as holographic horizons in a holographic duality framework for astrophysical black holes. Our formalism is applicable to spacetimes encompassing various types of black holes, including stationary ones like Kerr, Kerr-Newman, as well as static black holes such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with modified entanglement receive corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the Basis Light-Front Quantization framework, we systematically investigate the subleading twist (twist-3) transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) of the proton beyond the Wandzura-Wilczek (WW) approximation. The subleading twist TMDs are not independent and can be decomposed into twist-2 and genuine twist-3 terms from the equations of motion. The latter involves quark-quark-gluon correlations and contains interferences between two light-front Fock sectors, $|qqq\rangle$ and $|qqqg\rangle$, which are usually neglected in the WW approximation.</description>

      <title>Topological Spherical T-duality -- Dimension change from higher degree $H$-flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Spherical T-duality was introduced by Bouwknegt, Evslin and Mathai in [BEM15] as an extension of topological T-duality from $S^1$-bundles to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-bundles endowed with closed 7-forms. This notion was further extended to sphere bundles by Lind, Sati and Westerland [LSW16] as a duality between $S^{2n-1}$-bundles endowed with closed $(4n-1)$-forms. We generalise this relation one step further and define T-duality for $S^{2n-1}$-bundles endowed with closed odd forms of arbitrary degree. The degree of the form determines the dimension of the fibers of the dual spaces. We show that $T$-duals exist and, as in the previous cases, $T$-dual spaces have isomorphic twisted cohomology. We finish by introducing a version of Courant algebroids which is compatible with spherical T-duality.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the leading and next-to-leading corrections to the real-time QCD static potential in a high temperature medium in the region where bound states transit from narrow resonances to wide ones. We find sizable contributions to both the real and the imaginary part of the potential. The calculation involves both loop diagrams calculated in the Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) effective theory and power corrections to the HTL Lagrangian calculated in QCD. We compare our results with recent lattice data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended dark matter objects (EDOs) are popular dark matter candidates that interact gravitationally with the Standard Model. These gravitational interactions can be used to constrain their allowed parameter space. However, EDOs can have different formation mechanisms, sizes, and shapes, requiring a case-by-case analysis when studying their impact on different areas of cosmology. We thus present a repository of all available bounds for these objects, with a code that allows plotting user-defined combinations of all up-to-date bounds for a given shape and different radii. We propose a standard for the EDOs' mass profiles so that different sets of bounds are consistent with each other, and provide instructions on using the code and contributing to the repository.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Screening mechanisms are a natural method for suppressing long-range forces in scalar-tensor theories as they link the local background density to their strength. Focusing on Brans-Dicke theories, those including a non-minimal coupling between a scalar degree of freedom and the Ricci scalar, we study the origin of these screening mechanisms from a field theory perspective, considering the influence of the Standard Model on the mechanisms. Additionally, we further consider the role of scale symmetries on screening, demonstrating that only certain sectors, those obtaining their mass via the Higgs mechanism, contribute to screening the fifth forces. This has significant implications for baryons, which obtain most of their mass from the gluon's binding energy. Given that the Planck mass is related to the vacuum expectation value of the non-minimally coupled field, we find an extensive region of the parameter space where screening mechanisms create a spatially dependent gravitational constant. We say that the field over-screens when this effect is more significant than the fifth forces suppressed by screening mechanisms, as we illustrate for the chameleon and symmetron models.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase-transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex, which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot-spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which give the sets of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot-spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes are crucial in understanding the ringdown phase after a merger. While for Kerr black holes these modes have been known for a long time, their calculation has remained a challenge in alternative theories of gravity. We obtain the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory without resorting to perturbation theory in the coupling constant. Our approach is based on a spectral decomposition of the linear perturbations of the metric and the scalar field. The quasinormal modes agree excellently with the perturbatively known slow rotation and weak coupling limits. For large coupling, though, the spectrum changes significantly.</description>

      <title>Positive Mass in General Relativity Without Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing problem in physics is why observed masses are always positive. While energy conditions in quantum field theory can partly answer this problem, in this paper we find evidence that classical general relativity abhors negative masses, without the need for quantum theory or energy conditions. This is done by considering many different models of negative-mass "stars" and showing they are dynamically unstable. A fortiori, we show that any barotropic negative-mass star must be dynamically unstable.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Dipole Moment in Braneworld Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational effects on the relativistic Dirac theory of a system such as a Hydrogen atom in the braneworld scenario. A gravitational dipole moment like contribution, arises in the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of the system through an exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This term violates the equivalence principle for the weak interaction that is restored in the average over the spins. Furthermore, it feels the effects of the extra dimensions, so that in a Universe with two additional spatial dimensions its energy contribution is amplified by an order of $\sim 10^{16}\ \text{eV}$ concerning to the energy of this term for ordinary space. The compactification radius for a Universe with two extra dimensions is within the experimental limits, where deviations from the inverse square law are being tested. This suggests that the energy value for the gravitational dipole term in this scenario may lead us to search for traces of extra dimensions in atomic spectroscopy, as well as experimental constraints for these dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Stability of Anisotropic Compact Stars Influenced by Dark Matter under Teleparallel Gravity: An Extended Gravitational Deformation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our investigation, we pioneer the development of geometrically deformed strange stars within the framework of teleparallel gravity theory through gravitational decoupling via the complete geometric deformation (CGD) technique. The significant finding is the precise solution for deformed strange star (SS) models achieved through the vanishing complexity factor scenario. Further, we introduce the concept of space-time deformation caused by dark matter (DM) content in DM haloes, leading to perturbations in the metric potentials $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components. Mathematically, this DM-induced deformation is achieved through the CGD method, where the decoupling parameter $\alpha$ governs the extent of DM influence. To validate our findings, we compare our model predictions with observational constraints, including GW190814 (with a mass range of $2.5-2.67 M_{\odot}$) and neutron stars (NSTRs) such as EXO 1785-248 [mass=$1.3_{-0.2}^{+0.2}~M_{\odot}$], 4U 1608-52 [mass=$1.74_{-0.14}^{+0.14}~M_{\odot}$], and PSR J0952-0607 [mass=$2.35_{-0.17}^{+0.17}~M_{\odot}$].
  Our investigation delves into the stability of the model by considering causality conditions, Herrera's Cracking Method, the adiabatic index, and the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion. We demonstrate that the developed model mimics a wide range of recently observed pulsars. To emphasize its compatibility, we highlight the predicted mass and radius in tabular form by varying both the parameters $\alpha$ and $\zeta_1$. Notably, our findings are consistent with the observation of gravitational waves from the first binary merger event. Furthermore, we compare our results with those obtained for a slow-rotating configuration. In addition to this, we discuss the moment of inertia using the Bejger-Haensel approach in this formulation.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Gravitational Wave Equations in Spherical Symmetry from Curvature Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole perturbation theory on spherically symmetric backgrounds has been instrumental in establishing various aspects about the gravitational dynamics close to black holes, and continues to be an interesting avenue to confront current challenges in gravitational physics. In this paper, we present an approach to perturbation theory in spherical symmetry that addresses simultaneously some conceivably inconvenient aspects of the traditional methods. In particular, focusing on Schwarzschild's background we are able to derive a decoupled wave equation, for a single complex variable, by simply computing one component of the curvature wave equation satisfied by a complex self-dual version of the Riemann tensor. The real and imaginary parts of the variable consist only of even and odd pieces of the metric fluctuation, respectively, and both satisfy the Regge-Wheeler equation. Besides providing a systematic derivation of decoupled equations, an immediate corollary of our results is the isospectrality between even and odd sectors. We conclude by discussing potential extensions of our formalism to include matter and higher orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After Helmholtz, the mechanical foundation of thermodynamics included the First Law $d E = \delta Q + \delta W$, and the first part of the Clausius heat theorem $\delta Q^\text{rev}/T = dS$. The resulting invariance of the entropy $S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection with Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an idea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa $\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for deriving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up with an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a Noether charge.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme magnetic fields on the QCD topological susceptibility in the vicinity of the crossover region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the topological susceptibility from lattice QCD in the presence of strong background magnetic fields. Our simulations employ 2+1 flavours of stout improved staggered quarks with physical masses and cover a broad range of temperatures and magnetic field values. The results are extrapolated to the continuum limit using four different lattice spacings and an eigenvalue reweighting technique to reduce discretisation errors. For low temperatures, our calculations show an enhancement of the topological susceptibility due to the magnetic field, compatible with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At high temperatures, we observe the impact of inverse magnetic catalysis on the susceptibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillations of black hole spacetimes exhibit divergent behavior toward the bifurcation sphere and spatial infinity. This divergence can be understood as a consequence of the geometry in these spacetime regions. In contrast, black-hole oscillations are regular when evaluated toward the event horizon and null infinity. Hyperboloidal surfaces naturally connect these regions, providing a geometric regularization of time-harmonic oscillations called quasinormal modes (QNMs). This review traces the historical development of the hyperboloidal approach to QNMs. We discuss the physical motivation for the hyperboloidal approach and highlight current developments in the field.</description>

Abstract: We consider Weyl-invariant quadratic Einstein-Cartan gravity coupled to a scalar field and study the inflationary behaviour of the coupled system of the scalar field and the pseudoscalar associated with the Holst invariant. We find that the model is characterized by effective single-field inflation occurring at small field values and analyze its predictions which are in comfortable agreement with existing observations for a range of parameter values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a model of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson inflaton field coupled to a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field. This model naturally leads to a warm inflation scenario, where the inflationary dynamics is dominated by thermal dissipation. In this work, we consider a scenario where the inflaton, an axion-like field, is coupled to the $SU(2)$ gauge field, similar to chromoinflation models. Both the inflaton and the gauge field with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value are coupled to a thermal radiation bath. We demonstrate that the presence of the thermal bath during warm chromoinflation induces a thermal plasma mass for the background gauge field. This thermal mass can significantly disrupt the dynamics of the background gauge field, thereby driving it to its trivial null solution.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problems of determining whether a given set is a good or bad approximation to a $t$-design. We show that this problem is in $\textsf{PP}$ for any constant $t$ and is $\textsf{PP}$-hard for $t=1,2$ and $3$. Remarkably, this remains true even when the set is promised to be either exponentially close to or no closer than a constant to a $1$-design, particularly illustrating that, while unitary and state designs are powerful information resources, it is inherently hard to determine their properties. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, we present the formal derivation of the modified Friedmann equations inspired by the Barrow entropy, $S\sim A ^{1+\delta/2}$, where $0\leq\delta\leq 1$ is the Barrow exponent and $A$ is the horizon area. We then constrain the exponent $\delta$ by using Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) observational data. In order to impose the upper bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$, we set the observational bound on $\left| \frac{\delta T_f} {T_f }\right|$. We find out that the Barrow parameter $\delta$ should be around $ \delta \simeq 0.01$ in order not to spoil the BBN era. Next we derive the bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$ in a different approach in which we analyze the effects of Barrow cosmology on the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium $_{}^{4}\textit{He}$, Deuterium $D$ and Lithium $_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$. We observe that the deviation from standard Bekenstein-Hawking expression is small as expected. Additionally we present the relation between cosmic time $t$ and temperature $T$ in the context of modified Barrow cosmology. We confirm that the temperature of the early universe increases as the Barrow exponent $\delta$ (fractal structure of the horizon) increases, too.</description>

      <title>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed "deep boundary criticality". Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</description>

Abstract: Langlands duality is one of the most influential topics in mathematical research. It has many different appearances and influential subtopics. Yet there is a topic that until now seems unrelated to the Langlands program. That is the topic of invariant differential operators. That is strange since both items are deeply rooted in Harish-Chandra's representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. In this paper we start building the bridge between the two programs.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole gauge theory: anti-Higgs mechanism and elastic dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the duality between elasticity and fracton gauge theory, we study an extension of the gauge group that includes the quadrupole moment. Remarkably, we find that spontaneous breaking of the quadrupole symmetry increases the number of massless excitations. This result appears to challenge the well-established paradigm, according to which gauge fields acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are rendered massive. We refer to this phenomenon as the anti-Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the quadrupole gauge theory is dual to an exotic class of elastic systems, which we dub incompressible crystals. The anti-Higgs mechanism in the dual theory corresponds to a phase transition from the incompressible crystal state to an ordinary (compressible) solid.</description>

      <title>Topological Elliptic Genera I -- The mathematical foundation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct {\it Topological Elliptic Genera}, homotopy-theoretic refinements of the elliptic genera for $SU$-manifolds and variants including the Witten-Landweber-Ochanine genus. The codomains are genuinely $G$-equivariant Topological Modular Forms developed by Gepner-Meier, twisted by $G$-representations. As the first installment of a series of articles on Topological Elliptic Genera, this issue lays the mathematical foundation and discusses immediate applications. Most notably, we deduce an interesting divisibility result for the Euler numbers of $Sp$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Highest weight vectors, shifted topological recursion and quantum curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of topological recursion by considering Airy structures whose partition functions are highest weight vectors of particular $\mathcal{W}$-algebra representations. Such highest weight vectors arise as partition functions of Airy structures only under certain conditions on the representations. In the spectral curve formulation of topological recursion, we show that this generalization amounts to adding specific terms to the correlators $ \omega_{g,1}$, which leads to a ``shifted topological recursion'' formula. We then prove that the wave-functions constructed from this shifted version of topological recursion are WKB solutions of families of quantizations of the spectral curve with $ \hbar$-dependent terms. In the reverse direction, starting from an $\hbar$-connection, we find that it is of topological type if the exact same conditions that we found for the Airy structures are satisfied. When this happens, the resulting shifted loop equations can be solved by the shifted topological recursion obtained earlier.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(N)/H$ nonlinear $\sigma$ models at nonzero $\theta$ angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N &gt;2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.</description>

      <title>Streamlined Krylov construction and classification of ergodic Floquet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>

      <title>Entropy flow in a parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra (typically, radiation), there is a useful definition of entropy flow based on discretizing the signal into Gabor's "atoms," say, by means of a windowed Fourier transform. In particular, applying this method to a parametric amplifier (paramp) driven by a classical pump and coupled to a zero-temperature Markovian bath, we find that the output entropy flux vanishes at large times, even though the energy and photon number fluxes remain nonzero. This is consistent with the manner in which the paramp is expected to release information about its initial state. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the off-diagonal coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to Gaussian environments.</description>

      <title>On Legacy of Starobinsky Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was one of the greatest cosmologists of all times, who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his big achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this memorial paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

      <title>Shadow of the Scalar Hairy Black Hole with Inverted Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the imaging of a hairy black hole (HBH) in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory, where Einstein gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar potential $V(\phi)=-\Lambda \phi^4 + \mu \phi^2$ with $\Lambda$ and $\mu$ are constants. As a consequence, a nontrivial scalar field at the event horizon $\phi_H$ allows the HBH to evade the no-hair theorem, bifurcate from the Schwarzschild black hole by acquiring some new properties, which can affect the shadow of the HBH received by a distant observer. The framework of ray-tracing is adopted to investigate the optical appearance of the HBH, thus the trajectories of light rays around the HBH can be classified into three emissions: direct, lensed and photon ring. Employing three models of optically and geometrically thin accretion disk, we compare the differences between the Schwarzschild black hole and HBH with same horizon radius in a specific model, and find that the size of the shadow and accretion disk increases as $\phi_H$ increases, but the brightness of the rings remain nearly unaffected, this implies our HBH can potentially mimic the Schwarzschild black hole if we vary the horizon radius of the HBH. Finally, we also constraint the parameter $\Lambda$ from the observations of supermassive black holes in the galactic center of M87 and Sgr A$^{*}$, which could offer new insights for imaging of black holes and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse phenomenological signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles, described by an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor, when coupled to fermionic matter. The latter is modelled by a tensor current coupled directly to the Kalb-Ramond field or by a pseudovector current coupled to the rank-1 dual of the field-strength tensor. We obtain limits on the coupling constants to fermions and mass of the Kalb-Ramond-like particles by investigating their impact on the spectroscopy of simple atomic systems, the tree-level unitarity of the $S$ matrix for $e^- + e^+ \rightarrow \ell^- + \ell^+$ scattering with $\ell \neq e$ and the differential cross section for Bhabha scattering. Assuming that the couplings to fermions are independent of the fermion species, the strongest $95\%$-CL bounds we find are from LEP data at $\sqrt{s} = 136.23$~GeV, namely $g_{\rm PV}/\Lambda \lesssim 6.3 \times 10^{-13} \, {\rm eV}^{-1}$ and $g_{\rm T} \lesssim 1.3 \times 10^{-12} \left( m/{\rm eV} \right)$, both for $m \ll \sqrt{s}$ (here $\Lambda$ is a characteristic energy scale). These limits can be improved in upcoming lepton colliders due to enhanced precision, as well as higher energies.</description>
