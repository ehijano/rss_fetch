      <title>Q-Learning to navigate turbulence without a map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of olfactory searches in a turbulent environment. We focus on agents that respond solely to odor stimuli, with no access to spatial perception nor prior information about the odor location. We ask whether navigation strategies to a target can be learned robustly within a sequential decision making framework. We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm using a small set of interpretable olfactory states and train it with realistic turbulent odor cues. By introducing a temporal memory, we demonstrate that two salient features of odor traces, discretized in few olfactory states, are sufficient to learn navigation in a realistic odor plume. Performance is dictated by the sparse nature of turbulent plumes. An optimal memory exists which ignores blanks within the plume and activates a recovery strategy outside the plume. We obtain the best performance by letting agents learn their recovery strategy and show that it is mostly casting cross wind, similar to behavior observed in flying insects. The optimal strategy is robust to substantial changes in the odor plumes, suggesting minor parameter tuning may be sufficient to adapt to different environments.</description>

      <title>Photon correlation time-asymmetry and dynamical coherence in multichromophoric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate polarization-filtered two-photon correlations for the light emitted by a multichromophoric system undergoing excitation transport under realistic exciton-phonon interactions, and subject to continuous incoherent illumination. We show that for a biomolecular aggregate, such as the Fenna-Matthews Olson (FMO) photosynthetic complex, time-asymmetries in the cross-correlations of photons corresponding to different polarizations can be exploited to probe both quantum coherent transport mechanisms and steady-state coherence properties, which are not witnessed by zero-delay correlations. A classical bound on correlation asymmetry is obtained, which FMO is shown to violate using exact numerical calculations. Our analysis indicates that the dominant contributions to time-asymmetry in such photon cross-correlations are population to coherence transfer for Frenkel-Exciton models. Our results therefore put forward photon correlation asymmetry as a promising approach to investigate coherent contributions to excited-stated dynamics in molecular aggregates and other many-site quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>A Nitrogen Alternative: Use of Plasma Activated Water as Nitrogen Source in Hydroponic Solution for Radish Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study investigates the potential of Plasma-Activated Water (PAW) as a nitrogen supplement in hydroponic cultivation (HS-N+PAW), specifically focusing on radish seed germination and plant growth. PAW, produced using a dielectric barrier discharge pencil plasma jet using air as plasma forming gas, is compared against conventional hydroponic solution (HS) and hydroponic solution without nitrogen (HS-N). PAW treatment completely eliminates microbial growth in seeds. Radish plants cultivated with HS-N+PAW display approximately 30% and 3% longer roots compared to those grown with HS-N and HS, respectively, with shoot length increasing by ~16.5% (HS-N) and &lt;1% (HS). Root weight sees a substantial increase of ~51% with HS-N+PAW compared to HS-N, while the increase with HS is not significant. Similarly, shoot fresh weight sees a notable increase of 50% (HS-N) and 10% (HS). In terms of biochemical composition, radish roots show a significant increase of approximately 15.3% in soluble sugar concentration with HS-N+PAW compared to HS-N. Protein concentration in radish leaves increases by ~5.1% and ~19.0% with HS-N+PAW compared to HS-N and HS, respectively. Heightened soluble sugar and protein concentrations in HS-N+PAW-grown plants, indicating enhanced metabolic activity and nutrient uptake. However, variations in chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations in leaves among different growth media are statistically insignificant. H2O2 concentration root and shoot remains consistent across growth media, electrolytic and phenolic leakage, along with antioxidant enzyme activities, exhibit differential responses, underscoring the impact of growth conditions on plant stress responses.</description>

      <title>Enzymatic Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "enzymatic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The enzyme is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of enzymatic aggregation in the model with mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>

      <title>Can Ephapticity Contributes to the Brain Complexity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inquiry into the origin of brain complexity remains a pivotal question in neuroscience. While synaptic stimuli are acknowledged as significant, their efficacy often falls short in elucidating the extensive interconnections of the brain and nuanced levels of cognitive integration. Recent advances in neuroscience have brought the mechanisms underlying the generation of highly intricate dynamics, emergent patterns, and sophisticated oscillatory signals into question. Within this context, our study, in alignment with current research, posits the hypothesis that ephaptic communication may emerge as the primary candidate for unraveling optimal brain complexity. In this investigation, we conducted a comparative analysis between two types of networks utilizing the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Ephaptic model (QIF-E): (I) a small-world synaptic network (ephaptic-off) and (II) a mixed composite network comprising a small-world synaptic network with the addition of an ephaptic network (ephaptic-on). Utilizing the Multiscale Entropy methodology, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the responses generated by both network configurations, with complexity assessed by integrating across all temporal scales. Our findings demonstrate that ephaptic coupling enhances complexity under specific topological conditions, considering variables such as time, spatial scales, and synaptic intensity. These results offer fresh insights into the dynamics of communication within the nervous system and underscore the fundamental role of ephapticity in regulating complex brain functions.</description>

      <title>Measuring vesicle loading with holographic microscopy and bulk light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report efforts to quantify the loading of cell-sized lipid vesicles using in-line digital holographic microscopy. This method does not require fluorescent reporters, fluorescent tracers, or radioactive tracers. A single-color LED light source takes the place of conventional illumination to generate holograms rather than bright field images. By modelling the vesicle's scattering in a microscope with a Lorenz-Mie light scattering model, and comparing the results to data holograms, we are able to measure the vesicle's refractive index and thus loading. Performing the same comparison for bulk light scattering measurements enables retrieval of vesicle loading for nanoscale vesicles.</description>

      <title>Robust, fast and accurate mapping of diffusional mean kurtosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is a methodology for measuring the extent of non-Gaussian diffusion in biological tissue, which has shown great promise in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of many neurological diseases and disorders. However, robust, fast and accurate estimation of kurtosis from clinically feasible data acquisitions remains a challenge. In this study, we first outline a new accurate approach of estimating mean kurtosis via the sub-diffusion mathematical framework. Crucially, this extension of the conventional DKI overcomes the limitation on the maximum b-value of the latter. Kurtosis and diffusivity can now be simply computed as functions of the sub-diffusion model parameters. Second, we propose a new fast and robust fitting procedure to estimate the sub-diffusion model parameters using two diffusion times without increasing acquisition time as for the conventional DKI. Third, our sub-diffusion based kurtosis mapping method is evaluated using both simulations and the Connectome 1.0 human brain data. Exquisite tissue contrast is achieved even when the diffusion encoded data is collected in only minutes. In summary, our findings suggest robust, fast and accurate estimation of mean kurtosis can be realised within a clinically feasible diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition time.</description>

      <title>Exploring the benefits of DNA-target search with antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most common gene regulation mechanism is when a protein binds to a regulatory sequence to change RNA transcription. However, these sequences are short relative to the genome length, so finding them poses a challenging search problem. This paper presents two mathematical frameworks capturing different aspects of this problem. First, we study the interplay between diffusional flux through a target where the searching proteins get sequestered on DNA far from the target because of non-specific interactions. From this model, we derive a simple formula for the optimal protein-DNA unbinding rate, maximizing the particle flux. Second, we study how the flux flows through a target on a single antenna with variable length. Here, we identify a non-trivial logarithmic correction to the linear behavior relative to the target size proposed by Smoluchowski's flux formula.</description>
