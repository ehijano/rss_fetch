      <title>Partial Nambu-Poisson structures on a convenient manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers an adaptation to the convenient setting of finite dimensional Nambu-Poisson structures. In particular, for partial Nambu structures, we look for those whose classical geometrical results in finite dimension can be extended to this infinite dimensional context. Finally, we are interested in the projective and direct limits of such structures.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the generalised Calabi-Yau problem in higher codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing a more flexible notion of convexity, we obtain a new Omori-Yau maximum principle for harmonic maps. In the spirit of the Calabi-Yau conjectures, this principle is more suitable for studying the unboundedness of certain totally geodesic projections of minimal submanifolds of higher codimension. We further explore this maximum principle by applying it to conformal maps, harmonic maps into Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, as well as cone, wedge and halfspace theorems.</description>

      <title>Strongly Gauduchon Hyperbolicity and Two Other Types of Hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes sG-hyperbolicity as a new tool for studying hyperbolicity on complex manifolds. It demonstrates that this notion leads to a wider class of divisorially hyperbolic manifolds compared to balanced hyperbolicity. We also introduce weakly p-K\"ahler hyperbolic structures and pluriclosed star split hyperbolic metrics as possible new avenues for exploration.</description>

      <title>On Nash resolution of (singular) Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any Lie algebroid $A$ admits a Nash-type blow-up $\mathrm{Nash}(A)$ that sits in a nice short exact sequence of Lie algebroids $0\rightarrow K\rightarrow \mathrm{Nash}(A)\rightarrow \mathcal{D}\rightarrow 0$ with $K$ a Lie algebra bundle and $\mathcal{D}$ a Lie algebroid whose anchor map is injective on an open dense subset. The base variety is a blowup determined by the singular foliation of $A$. We provide concrete examples. Moreover, we extend the construction following Mohsen's to singular subalgebroids in the sense of Androulidakis-Zambon.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we would have a brief overview of several proposals of quasilocal mass which are based on Hamiltonian formulation. We also show the positivity of the Wang-Yau energy under a more general condition. We then further study the quasilocal mass and DEC fill-ins defined by the author in terms of completeness and shields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a Riemannian manifold with a smooth function $f: M\to \mathbb{R}$, we consider the linearization of the Perelman scalar curvature $\mathcal{R}$ and its $L^2$-formal adjoint operator $\delta\mathcal{R}^*$. A manifold endowed with a metric $g$ whose operator $\delta\mathcal{R}^*$ has a nontrivial kernel is called a Perelman singular manifold. In this paper, we present examples and apply general maximum principles to obtain rigidity or nonexistence results in the underlying setting.</description>

      <title>Scattering rigidity for standard stationary manifolds via timelike geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering rigidity problem for standard stationary manifolds using timelike geodesics with a fixed angle. Taking advantage of the symmetry of this manifolds, we use Hamiltonian reduction to show that this problem is related to scattering rigidity for $\mathcal{MP}$-systems, a problem studied before. This gives several new rigidity results (up to some gauge) for this kind of Lorentzian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Strengthened injectivity radius bounds for manifolds with positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green's inequality shows that a compact    Riemannian manifold with scalar curvature at least $n(n-1)$ has    injectivity radius at most $\pi$, and that equality is achieved    only for the radius 1 sphere. In this work we show how extra    topological assumptions can lead to stronger upper bounds. The    topologies we consider are    $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{T}^{n-k-2}\times\mathbb{R}^k$ for    $n\leq 7$ and $0\leq k\leq 2$ and 3-manifolds with positive scalar    curvature except lens spaces $L(p,q)$ with $p$ odd. We also prove    a strengthened inequality for $3$-manifolds with positive scalar    curvature and large diameter. Our proof uses    previous results of Gromov and Zhu.</description>

      <title>A Weitzenb\"ock formula on Sasakian holomorphic bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work seeks to advance the understanding of the smooth structure of the moduli space of self-dual contact instantons (SDCI) on Sasakian 7-manifolds M. A neighborhood of a smooth point of M is locally modeled on the first cohomological group of an elliptic complex (1.4). There is a cohomological obstruction to the smoothness for the moduli space, in terms of a second basic cohomological group, in this paper we study conditions under which this obstruction disappears, by computing a Weitzenb\"ock formula and using a Bochner-type method to obtain a vanishing theorem. Given an SDCI on a Sasakian bundle E, we find sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the obstruction in the positivity of a couple of operators R and F depending on the curvatures of the connection and the Riemann curvature of the Sasakian metric g. In particular, we find that if M is transversely Ricci positive and F positive, the moduli space of SDCI must be smooth. However, in general, the operator F is not positive definite and we describe bundles over the Stiefel manifold for which it is the case. Finally, we show that when the energy of the curvature is less than the first non-zero eigenvalue of RicT the obstruction vanishes.</description>

      <title>Corrections of minor misstatements in several papers on ECS manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper [3] the value of the invariant denoted by d and often called "rank" was misstated for a narrow class of examples of ECS manifolds: they were identified as having d = 1 instead of the correct value d = 2. The error was repeated, by citing [3], in [1], [2] and [4] -- [7]. We briefly describe the class in question, explain why it has d = 2, and list the required corrections of the affected papers.</description>

      <title>Complete totally geodesic subsets of the complex hyperbolic plane: an elementary classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-trivial complete totally geodesic submanifolds of the complex hyperbolic plane $\mathbb H_{\mathbb C}^2$ are the complex geodesics and the real planes. We present two new proofs for this fact. One is a short proof based on an algebraic formula for the Riemann curvature tensor due to S. Anan'in and C. Grossi and resembles the traditional proof using Lie theory. The other is purely elementary and geometric, relying on the structures in $\mathbb H_{\mathbb C}^2$ instead of general theories. In this second approach, we prove a slightly stronger result: the only non-trivial complete totally geodesic subsets of $\mathbb H_{\mathbb C}^2$ are the complex geodesics and the real planes without assuming that the subsets are submanifolds a priori. This second proof is also intriguing for only making use of elementary geometric constructions.</description>

      <title>On the differential geometry of smooth ruled surfaces in 4-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A smooth ruled surface in 4-space has only parabolic points or inflection points of real type. We show, by means of contact with transverse planes, that at a parabolic point, there exist two tangent directions determining two planes along which the parallel projection exhibits $\mathcal A$-singularities of type butterfly or worse. In particular, such parabolic point can be classified as butterfly hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic point depending on the value of the discriminant of a binary differential equation (BDE). Also, whenever such discriminant is positive, we ensure that the integral curves of these directions form a pair of foliations on the ruled surface. Moreover, the set of points that nullify the discriminant is a regular curve transverse to the regular curve formed by inflection points of real type. Finally, using a particular projective transformation, we obtain a simple parametrization of the ruled surface such that the moduli of its 5-jet identify a butterfly hyperbolic/parabolic/elliptic point, as well as we get the stable configurations of the solutions of BDE in the discriminant curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hessian geometry associated with an ideal gas in a spherical centrifuge. According to Souriau, a spherically confined ideal gas admit states of thermal and rotational equilibrium. These states, called Gibbs states, form an exponential family with an action of the Euclidean rotation group. We investigate its Hessian (Fisher-Rao) geometry and show that in the high angular velocity limit, the geometry can be compared to the Hessian geometry of a spherical rigid body which we show to be isometric to a hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based gradient descent methods for Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyak's Heavy Ball (PHB; Polyak, 1964), a.k.a. Classical Momentum, and Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG; Nesterov, 1983) are well know examples of momentum-descent methods for optimization. While the latter outperforms the former, solely generalizations of PHB-like methods to nonlinear spaces have been described in the literature. We propose here a generalization of NAG-like methods for Lie group optimization based on the variational one-to-one correspondence between classical and accelerated momentum methods (Campos et al., 2023). Numerical experiments are shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of convexity of functions defined on global nonpositive curvature spaces by introducing (geodesically) $h$-convex functions. We prove estimates of Hermite-Hadamard type via Katugampola's fractional integrals. We obtain an important corollary which gives an essentially sharp estimate involving squared distance mappings between points in a global NPC space. This is a contribution to analysis on spaces with curved geometry.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Currents on Cohesive Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on a complex variety $X$ that has a locally free resolution $E^{\bullet}$. In [19], the authors constructed a pseudomeromorphic current whose support is contained in $supp(E^{\bullet})$ that represents products of Chern classes of $\mathcal{F}.$ In this paper, we show that their construction works for general de-Rham characteristic classes and then generalize it to represent products (in de-Rham cohomology) of characteristic forms of cohesive modules defined by Block. Finally, we state a corollary to a transgression result in [16] that show that it is sufficient to only use the degree-$0$ and degree-$1$ parts of the superconnection to construct currents that represent characteristic forms of cohesive modules in the Bott-Chern cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a theory of Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to coarse cocycles of convergence groups. This framework includes Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to the Busemann cocycle on the geodesic boundary of a Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces and Patterson-Sullivan measures on flag manifolds associated to Anosov (or more general transverse) subgroups of semisimple Lie groups, as well as more examples. Under some natural geometric assumptions on the coarse cocycle, we prove existence, uniqueness, and ergodicity results.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent for unbounded convex functions on Hadamard manifolds and its applications to scaling problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic behaviors of continuous-time and discrete-time gradient flows of a ``lower-unbounded" convex function $f$ on a Hadamard manifold $M$, particularly, their convergence properties to the boundary $M^{\infty}$ at infinity of $M$. We establish a duality theorem that the infimum of the gradient-norm $\|\nabla f(x)\|$ of $f$ over $M$ is equal to the supremum of the negative of the recession function $f^{\infty}$ of $f$ over the boundary $M^{\infty}$, provided the infimum is positive. Further, the infimum and the supremum are obtained by the limits of the gradient flows of $f$, Our results feature convex-optimization ingredients of the moment-weight inequality for reductive group actions by Georgoulas, Robbin, and Salamon,and are applied to noncommutative optimization by B\"urgisser et al. FOCS 2019. We show that the gradient descent of the Kempf-Ness function for an unstable orbit converges to a 1-parameter subgroup in the Hilbert-Mumford criterion, and the associated moment-map sequence converges to the mimimum-norm point of the moment polytope. We show further refinements for operator scaling -- the left-right action on a matrix tuple $A= (A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N)$. We characterize the gradient-flow limit of operator scaling via a vector-space generalization of the classical Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition of a bipartite graph. Also, for a special case of $N = 2$, we reveal that this limit determines the Kronecker canonical form of matrix pencils $s A_1+A_2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note is based on Professor Vitali Kapovitch's comparison geometry course at the University of Toronto. It delves into various comparison theorems, including those by Rauch and Toponogov, with a focus on their applications such as Bishop-Gromov volume comparison, critical point theory of distance functions, diameter sphere theorem, and negative and nonnegative curvature. Additionally, it covers the soul theorem, splitting theorem, and covering theorem by Cheeger-Gromoll, as well as Perelman's proof on the soul conjecture. Finally, the note introduces Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, Alexandrov Spaces, and the Finite Homotopy type theorem by Grove-Peterson.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Reachability on Riemannian Manifolds for Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the reachable set for a given nonlinear system is critically important for autonomous trajectory planning for reach-avoid applications and safety critical scenarios. Providing the reachable set is generally impossible when the dynamics are unknown, so we calculate underapproximations of such sets using local dynamics at a single point and bounds on the rate of change of the dynamics determined from known physical laws. Motivated by scenarios where an adverse event causes an abrupt change in the dynamics, we attempt to determine a provably reachable set of states without knowledge of the dynamics. This paper considers systems which are known to operate on a manifold. Underapproximations are calculated by utilizing the aforementioned knowledge to derive a guaranteed set of velocities on the tangent bundle of a complete Riemannian manifold that can be reached within a finite time horizon. We then interpret said set as a control system; the trajectories of this control system provide us with a guaranteed set of reachable states the unknown system can reach within a given time. The results are general enough to apply on systems that operate on any complete Riemannian manifold. To illustrate the practical implementation of our results, we apply our algorithm to a model of a pendulum operating on a sphere and a three-dimensional rotational system which lives on the abstract set of special orthogonal matrices.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial Massey products on compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the bigraded quasi-isomorphism type of the bigraded, bidifferential algebra of forms on a compact K\"ahler manifold generally contains more information than the de Rham cohomology algebra with its real Hodge structure. More precisely, on any closed Riemann surface of genus at least two, there is a nontrivial ABC-Massey product. Furthermore, starting from dimension three, there are simply connected projective manifolds with a nonzero ABC-Massey product of three divisor classes. In particular, compact K\"ahler manifolds are generally not formal in the sense of pluripotential homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>The Lorentzian scattering rigidity problem and rigidity of stationary metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scattering rigidity in Lorentzian geometry: recovery of a Lorentzian metric from the scattering relation $\mathcal{S}^\sharp$ known on a lateral boundary. We show that, under a non-conjugacy assumption, every defining function $r(x,y)$ of pairs of boundary points which can be connected by a lightlike geodesic plays the role of the boundary distance function in the Riemannian case in the following sense. Its linearization is the light ray transform of tensor fields of order two which are the perturbations of the metric. Next, we study scattering rigidity of stationary metrics in time-space cylinders and show that it can be reduced to boundary rigidity of magnetic systems on the base; a problem studied previously. This implies several scattering rigidity results for stationary metrics.</description>

Abstract: We study left invariant locally conformally product structures on simply connected Lie groups and give their complete description in the solvable unimodular case. Based on previous classification results, we then obtain the complete list of solvable unimodular Lie algebras up to dimension 5 which carry LCP structures, and study the existence of lattices in the corresponding simply connected Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Quantitative stability of harmonic maps from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{S}^2$ with higher degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.07630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For degree $\pm 1$ harmonic maps from $\mathbb{R}^2$ (or $\mathbb{S}^2$) to $\mathbb{S}^2$, Bernand-Mantel, Muratov and Simon \cite{bernand2021quantitative} recently establish a uniformly quantitative stability estimate. Namely, for any map $u:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{S}^2$ with degree $\pm 1$, the discrepancy of its Dirichlet energy and $4\pi$ can linearly control the $\dot H^1$-difference of $u$ from the set of degree $\pm 1$ harmonic maps. Whether a similar estimate holds for harmonic maps with higher degree is unknown. In this paper, we prove that a similar quantitative stability result for higher degree is true only in local sense. Namely, given a harmonic map, a similar estimate holds if $u$ is already sufficiently near to it (modulo M\"{o}bius transform) and the bound in general depends on the given harmonic map. More importantly, we investigate an example of degree 2 case thoroughly, which shows that it fails to have a uniformly quantitative estimate like the degree $\pm 1$ case. This phenomenon show the striking difference of degree $\pm1$ ones and higher degree ones. Finally, we also conjecture a new uniformly quantitative stability estimate based on our computation.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety. We construct partial Okounkov bodies associated to Hermitian pseudo-effective line bundles $(L,\phi)$ on $X$. We show that partial Okounkov bodies are universal invariants of the singularity of $\phi$. As an application, we generalize the theorem of Boucksom--Chen and construct Duistermaat--Heckman measures associated with finite energy metrics on the Berkovich analytification of an ample line bundle.</description>

      <title>Kohler-Jobin meets Ehrhard: the sharp lower bound for the Gaussian principal frequency while the Gaussian torsional rigidity is fixed, via rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we provide an adaptation of the Kohler-Jobin rearrangement technique to the setting of the Gauss space. As a result, we prove the Gaussian analogue of the Kohler-Jobin's resolution of a conjecture of P\'{o}lya-Szeg\"o: when the Gaussian torsional rigidity of a (convex) domain is fixed, the Gaussian principal frequency is minimized for the half-space. At the core of this rearrangement technique is the idea of considering a "modified" torsional rigidity, with respect to a given function, and rearranging its layers to half-spaces, in a particular way; the Rayleigh quotient decreases with this procedure.
  We emphasize that the analogy of the Gaussian case with the Lebesgue case is not to be expected here, as in addition to some soft symmetrization ideas, the argument relies on the properties of some special functions; the fact that this analogy does hold is somewhat of a miracle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2003, Klainerman and Nicol\`o \cite{Kl-Ni} proved the stability of Minkowski in the case of the exterior of an outgoing null cone. Relying on the method used in \cite{Kl-Ni}, Caciotta and Nicol\`o \cite{Ca-Ni} proved the stability of Kerr spacetime in external regions, i.e. outside an outgoing null cone far away from the Kerr event horizon. In this paper, we give a new proof of \cite{Ca-Ni}. Compared to \cite{Ca-Ni}, we reduce the number of derivatives needed in the proof, simplify the treatment of the last slice, and provide a unified treatment of the decay of initial data which contains in particular the initial data considered by Klainerman and Szeftel in \cite{KS:main}. Also, concerning the treatment of curvature estimates, similar to \cite{ShenMink}, we replace the vectorfield method used in \cite{Kl-Ni,Ca-Ni} by $r^p$-weighted estimates introduced by Dafermos and Rodnianski in \cite{Da-Ro}.</description>

      <title>The fine structure of the singular set of area-minimizing integral currents II: rectifiability of flat singular points with singularity degree larger than $1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an area-minimizing integral current $T$ of codimension higher than $1$ in a smooth Riemannian manifold $\Sigma$. In a previous paper we have subdivided the set of interior singular points with at least one flat tangent cone according to a real parameter, which we refer to as ``singularity degree''. This parameter determines the infinitesimal order of contact at the point in question between the ``singular part'' of $T$ and its ``best regular approximation''. In this paper we show that the set of points for which the singularity degree is strictly larger than $1$, is $(m-2)$-rectifiable. In a subsequent work we prove that the remaining flat singular points form an $(m-2)$-null set, thus concluding that the singular set of $T$ is $m-2$-rectifiable.</description>

      <title>On the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions on a compact, smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. For generic metrics on $M$ we establish an identity which relates the sum of the indexes of a Steklov eigenfunction, the sum of the indexes of its restriction to $\partial M$, and the Euler characteristic of $M$. In dimension $2$ this identity gives a precise count of the interior critical points of a Steklov eigenfunction in terms of the Euler characteristic of $M$ and of the number of sign changes of $u$ on $\partial M$. In the case of the second Steklov eigenfunction on a genus $0$ surface, the identity holds for any metric. As a by-product of the main result, we show that for generic metrics on $M$ Steklov eigenfunctions are Morse functions in $M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from the circle with its geodesic metric to any simply connected geodesic space is never smaller than $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We also prove that this bound is tight through the construction of a simply connected geodesic space $\mathrm{E}$ which attains the lower bound $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We deduce the first statement from a general result that we also establish which gives conditions on how small the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two geodesic metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y )$ has to be in order for $\pi_1(X)$ and $\pi_1(Y)$ to be isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Representability of Elliptic Moduli Problems in Derived $C^{\infty}$-Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of solutions of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations on manifolds in the framework of derived $C^{\infty}$-geometry. For an arbitrary smooth stack $S$, we define $S$-families of nonlinear PDEs acting between $S$-families of submersions over an $S$-family of manifolds and show that in case the family of PDEs is elliptic and the base family of manifolds is proper over $S$, then the moduli stack of solutions is relatively representable by quasi-smooth derived $C^{\infty}$-schemes over $S$. Along the way, we develop tools to analyse the local structure of families of mapping stacks between manifolds and explain how to compare mapping stacks in smooth and in derived geometry. To access the notion of a family of PDEs over an arbitrary smooth base stack, we introduce a formalism of stacks of relative jets. Finally, we show how natural ideas from (higher) topos theory can be leveraged to facilitate the application of nonlinear Fredholm analysis to derived stacks of solutions of elliptic PDEs.</description>
