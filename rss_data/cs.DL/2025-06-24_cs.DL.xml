      <title>Mapping the Evolution of Research Contributions using KnoVo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents KnoVo (Knowledge Evolution), an intelligent framework designed for quantifying and analyzing the evolution of research novelty in the scientific literature. Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application, dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions, uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the Past: A Comprehensive Deep Learning Approach to Analyzing Incunabula Pages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18069v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a proof-of-concept method for the automatic analysis of the structure and content of incunabula pages. A custom dataset comprising 500 annotated pages from five different incunabula was created using resources from the Jagiellonian Digital Library. Each page was manually labeled with five predefined classes: Text, Title, Picture, Table, and Handwriting. Additionally, the publicly available DocLayNet dataset was utilized as supplementary training data. To perform object detection, YOLO11n and YOLO11s models were employed and trained using two strategies: a combined dataset (DocLayNet and the custom dataset) and the custom dataset alone. The highest performance (F1 = 0.94) was achieved by the YOLO11n model trained exclusively on the custom data. Optical character recognition was then conducted on regions classified as Text, using both Tesseract and Kraken OCR, with Tesseract demonstrating superior results. Subsequently, image classification was applied to the Picture class using a ResNet18 model, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% across five subclasses: Decorative_letter, Illustration, Other, Stamp, and Wrong_detection. Furthermore, the CLIP model was utilized to generate semantic descriptions of illustrations. The results confirm the potential of machine learning in the analysis of early printed books, while emphasizing the need for further advancements in OCR performance and visual content interpretation.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Scientific Rankings with Breakthrough and Disruption Metrics: A Complex Network-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific progress is often driven by groundbreaking and disruptive research, yet traditional metrics for evaluating contributions to science often emphasize quantity over quality. In this study, we consider metrics that focus on the quality of scientific performance of countries and propose a novel framework that facilitates a competitive ranking of these countries based on their performance, highlighting the impact of their contributions. Using a bipartite network and centrality measures computed through the GENEPY scheme, we evaluate the complexity and diversity of scientific fields. The analysis incorporates two quality indicators of a research paper: the network-based normalized citation score (NBNC) to identify high-impact articles and the Disruptive Index (CD) to classify research as consolidating or disruptive. These metrics focus on the perspective of citing articles, providing a localized view of scientific influence. Our study draws on bibliometric data from OpenAlex, encompassing nearly 60 million articles in the domain of physical sciences published between 1900 and 2023. This data spans 10 fields, 89 subfields, and approximately 1,300 topics, offering a comprehensive view of scientific development over time. By focusing on quality indicators such as breakthroughs and disruptive research, our framework underscores the importance of transformative contributions that challenge existing paradigms and drive innovation. This approach not only highlights the leading contributors to global science but also reveals patterns in the evolution of scientific fields. By prioritizing impactful research, our study offers insights into optimizing resources for advancing science. The results are relevant for policymakers, funding agencies, and researchers, providing a clearer understanding of how quality-driven metrics can reshape the evaluation of scientific performance on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Scientific Knowledge Extraction on Linked Open Data using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature challenges researchers extracting and synthesizing knowledge. Traditional search engines return many sources without direct, detailed answers, while general-purpose LLMs may offer concise responses that lack depth or omit current information. LLMs with search capabilities are also limited by context window, yielding short, incomplete answers. This paper introduces WISE (Workflow for Intelligent Scientific Knowledge Extraction), a system addressing these limits by using a structured workflow to extract, refine, and rank query-specific knowledge. WISE uses an LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine data, focusing on query-aligned, context-aware, and non-redundant information. Dynamic scoring and ranking prioritize unique contributions from each source, and adaptive stopping criteria minimize processing overhead. WISE delivers detailed, organized answers by systematically exploring and synthesizing knowledge from diverse sources. Experiments on HBB gene-associated diseases demonstrate WISE reduces processed text by over 80% while achieving significantly higher recall over baselines like search engines and other LLM-based approaches. ROUGE and BLEU metrics reveal WISE's output is more unique than other systems, and a novel level-based metric shows it provides more in-depth information. We also explore how the WISE workflow can be adapted for diverse domains like drug discovery, material science, and social science, enabling efficient knowledge extraction and synthesis from unstructured scientific papers and web sources.</description>

      <title>Decoding University Hierarchy and Prestige in China through Domestic Ph.D. Hiring Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The academic job market for fresh Ph.D. students to pursue postdoctoral and junior faculty positions plays a crucial role in shaping the future orientations, developments, and status of the global academic system. In this work, we focus on the domestic Ph.D. hiring network among universities in China by exploring the doctoral education and academic employment of nearly 28,000 scientists across all Ph.D.-granting Chinese universities over three decades. We employ the minimum violation rankings algorithm to decode the rankings for universities based on the Ph.D. hiring network, which offers a deep understanding of the structure and dynamics within the network. Our results uncover a consistent, highly structured hierarchy within this hiring network, indicating the imbalances wherein a limited number of universities serve as the main sources of fresh Ph.D. across diverse disciplines. Furthermore, over time, it has become increasingly challenging for Chinese Ph.D. graduates to secure positions at institutions more prestigious than their alma maters. This study quantitatively captures the evolving structure of talent circulation in the domestic environment, providing valuable insights to enhance the organization, diversity, and talent distribution in China's academic enterprise.</description>

      <title>Rich Interoperable Metadata for Cultural Heritage Projects at Jagiellonian University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rich metadata created nowadays for objects stored in libraries has nowhere to be stored, because core standards, namely MARC 21 and Dublin Core, are not flexible enough. The aim of this paper is to summarize our work-in-progress on tackling this problem in research on cultural heritage objects at the Jagiellonian University (JU). We compared the objects' metadata currently being collected at the JU (with examples of manuscript, placard, and obituary) with five widespread metadata standards used by the cultural heritage community: Dublin Core, EAD, MODS, EDM and Digital Scriptorium. Our preliminary results showed that mapping between them is indeed problematic, but we identified requirements that should be followed in further work on the JU cultural heritage metadata schema in order to achieve maximum interoperability. As we move forward, based on the successive versions of the conceptual model, we will conduct experiments to validate the practical feasibility of these mappings and the degree to which the proposed model will actually enable integration with data in these various metadata formats.</description>

      <title>The Innovative Distinctiveness of Prizewinners and their Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Science prizes purportedly reward innovation and explorations of new phenomena. Yet, in practice prizes may inadvertently divert resources from similarly impactful but less celebrated scholars. Despite this paradox, knowledge of how prizewinning relates to innovation is nascent even as prizes proliferate widely. Analyzing 2,460 worldwide prizes, we compared the innovativeness of over 23,000 prizewinners and matched non-prizewinners whose performance records were statistically equivalent up to the prize year. First, we find that prizewinners are more innovative. Their research is more likely to combine existing ideas in new ways, integrate a topic's historical and contemporary thinking, and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives. Second, although prizewinners and matched non-prizewinners have statistically equivalent impact and productivity records up to the prize year, at about five years before the prize, prizewinners' papers become more innovative than their matched peers, a difference that widens each year, peaks during the prize year, and then persists for the remainder of their careers. Third, network embeddedness predicts unusual innovativeness. Compared to non-prizewinners, prizewinners' collaborations are shorter in duration, encompass wider exposure to unfamiliar topics, and involve coauthors whose networks minimally overlap with each other. The implications of the findings for the efficacy of reward systems and innovation in science are discussed.</description>
