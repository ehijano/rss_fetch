      <title>Galaxy-cluster-stacked Fermi-LAT III: substructure and radio-relic counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faint $\gamma$-ray signatures emerge in Fermi-LAT data stacked scaled to the characteristic $R_{500}$ radii of MCXC galaxy clusters. This third paper in a series shows a $4.3\sigma$ excess of discrete 4FGL-DR4 catalog $\gamma$-ray sources at the $r&lt;1.5R_{500}$ radii of 205 clusters, coincident with an $r\sim R_{500}$ diffuse $2.6\sigma$ excess of 1-100 GeV emission from 75 high-latitude clusters. The source excess becomes highly ($&gt;5\sigma$) significant when considering the substantial ($3.4\sigma$) and unexpectedly rapid quenching of $\gamma$-ray sources just inside the virial shock. The excess sources show radial, spectral, and luminosity distributions better matching radio-relic counterparts or substructure than present tentative classifications as blazar-candidates. Their spectral distribution is bimodal: flat-spectrum sources are consistent with enhanced hadronic emission behind weak, Mach $\sim2$ shocks, while softer sources may be phoenix counterparts.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the X-ray and Very High Energy $\gamma$-ray Flux from Supernova Remnant W44</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of GeV gamma-ray emission from the well-studied mixed-morphology supernova remnant (SNR) W44 by Fermi-LAT and AGILE imply that it is a site of significant cosmic ray acceleration. The spectral energy distribution (SED) derived from the GeV data suggest that the gamma-ray emission likely originates from the decay of neutral pions generated by cosmic-ray interactions. It is essential to measure the SED of W44 in the X-ray and very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray bands to verify the hadronic origin of the emission and to gauge the potential contributions from leptonic emission. We report an upper-limit of the nonthermal X-ray flux from W44 of 5 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5 - 8.0 keV band based on $\sim$ 300 ks of XMM-Newton observations. The X-ray upper limit is consistent with previously estimated hadronic models, but in tension with the leptonic models. We estimate the VHE flux upper limit of $\sim$ 1.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 0.5 - 5.0 TeV range from W44 using data from the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS). Our non-detection of W44 at VHE wavlengths is in agreemnent with observations from other imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and is perhaps consistent with the evolutionary stage of the SNR.</description>

      <title>R-JET: A postprocessing code for radiative transport in relativistic jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a post-processing radiative transport code for computing the spectra, the coreshift, and the surface-brightness distribution of special relativistic jets with arbitrary optical thickness. The jet consists of an electron-positron pair plasma and an electron-proton normal plasma. Electrons and positrons are relativistic and composed of thermal and nonthermal components, while protons are non-relativistic and non-radiating. The fraction of a pair plasma, as well as the fraction of a nonthermal component can be arbitrarily chosen. Only the synchrotron process is considered for emission and absorption when the radiative-transfer equation is integrated along our lines of sight. We describe a suite of test problems, and confirm the frequency dependence of the coreshift in the Konigl jet model, when the plasma is composed of nonthermal component alone. Finally, we illustrate the capabilities of the code with model calculations, demonstrating that the jet will exhibit a limb-brightened structure in general when it is energized by the rotational energy of the black hole. It is also demonstrated that such limb-brightened jets show a ring-like structure in the brightness map when we observe the jet launching region nearly face-on.</description>

      <title>Temporal variability and obscuration effects in the X-ray emission of classical nova V339 Delphini (Nova Delphini 2013)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a detailed analysis of public archival soft X-ray data on the classical nova V339 Delphini (Nova Del 2013) during its outburst, obtained using the {\it Chandra} High-Resolution Camera Spectrometer (HRC-S) and Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG), as well as {\it XMM-Newton} in 2013. The observations, spanning from day 85.2 to day 112.0 after the optical maximum, capture the nova during its luminous supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase. The spectra reveal numerous absorption features with blue-shifted velocities ranging from $\sim$ 724 to $\sim$ 1474 km s$^{-1}$, with the majority of lines blue-shifted by approximately 1200 km s$^{-1}$. We confirm the presence of a short-period modulation of the X-ray flux with a period of approximately 54 seconds, as well as the drift of this period, which was detected on days 97.0 and 112.0 during the outburst with both {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it Chandra}. This period modulation is transient in nature, with significant variations in amplitude and pulse profile over timescales of a few thousand seconds, likely due to temporary obscuration events that affect the emission from the central hot source. The pulse profiles exhibit substantial deviations from a pure sinusoidal shape, which may be related to the period drift. Additionally, the modulation amplitude shows a possible anti-correlation with the count rates on day 97.0, likely also caused by temporary obscuration events influencing the central source's emission.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Tidal Disruption Events and Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei via Variation of Mid-infrared Color</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, there is a lack of effective probes to distinguish between mid-infrared (MIR) outbursts induced by tidal disruption events (TDEs) and changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) based on only MIR data. Here, we propose that the time variation of MIR color (K-corrected W1-W2 after subtracting the quiescent fluxes) is a promising probe. With an optically selected sample containing TDEs, ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), and CLAGNs, we studied the MIR color variation of their MIR counterparts using NEOWISE-R data. We found that the MIR color of TDEs and ANTs turns red faster than CLAGNs during the rising phase, and TDEs have a redder color than ANTs at the earliest phase. The former may be caused by the difference between the ultraviolet light curves of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs, or be related to no or relatively weak underlying AGN in TDEs/ANTs, while the latter may be related to the difference in the dust geometry. Based on color variation rate, we selected high-probability TDE, ANT, and CLAGN candidates from MIR outbursts in samples of Jiang et al. (2021) and Masterson et al. (2024). We found that both samples are mixtures of TDEs/ANTs and CLAGNs. For MIR outbursts whose hosts are not Seyfert galaxies, we estimated that $\sim50\%-80\%$ are TDEs and inferred a rate of infrared TDEs of $1.5-2.8\times10^{-5}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable with that of optical TDEs. The rest are CLAGNs, suggesting the presence of weak AGNs that cannot be identified using common diagnoses. We predicted that with our method, a large amount of dust-obscured TDEs could be selected from future infrared surveys with higher data quality and cadence.</description>

      <title>Simulating the shaping of point-symmetric structures in the jittering jets explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of core-collapse supernovae by launching several pairs of jets into a collapsing core model and show that the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) can form a point-symmetric morphology that accounts for observed morphologies of many core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) remnants. Point-symmetric morphologies are composed of pairs of opposite structures around the center of the CCSN remnant. In the JJEM, the newly born neutron star launches several to a few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions, and these jets explode the star. In the simulations with the FLASH numerical code, we launch pairs of jets with varying directions, energies, opening angles, and durations into the massive stellar core and follow their evolution for about two seconds. We show that the jets form pairs of opposite filaments, clumps, bubbles, and lobes, namely, prominent point-symmetric morphologies. The interaction of the jets with the core leads to vigorous Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and excites many vortices, which also shape clumps and filaments. Our results strengthen the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Irradiated Pulsar Planets and Companions as 511 keV Positron Annihilation Line Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are prolific GeV {\gamma}-ray emitters, and nearly 80% of Fermi-LAT MSPs reside in compact binaries. We demonstrate that the companions in these compact MSPs binaries are also 511 keV annihilation line emitters using MEGAlib simulations (a high energy radiation transport software built with Geant4) to compute the particle showers and resulting backsplash emission from the pulsar irradiation. The 511 keV signal exhibits strong flux modulation and red/blueshifts associated with a binary orbit, enabling powerful coherent searches. Measuring the 511 keV emission would enable direct {\gamma}-ray characterization of unusual pulsar exoplanets and companions, and allow one to identify the unambiguous presence of active pulsars whose beams do not intercept Earth. Intriguingly, the 511 keV flux is brightest for ultra-compact systems against which pulsar surveys are systematically biased. These ultra-compact systems are also possibly prime LISA galactic sources. This necessitates future joint LISA-MeV {\gamma}-ray techniques to characterize MSP binaries. These MSP binaries may also contribute to the puzzling source of the excess 511 keV photons near the galactic bulge and center.</description>

      <title>The middle-aged pulsar PSR J1741-2054 and its bow-shock nebula in far ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The nearby middle-aged gamma-ray pulsar J1741-2054 and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) have been studied in X-rays, and its bow-shock nebula (BSN) has been investigated in the Balmer lines, but they have never been observed in far ultraviolet (FUV). Aims. To further study the thermal and magnetospheric emission from PSR J1741-2054 and the BSN properties, we observed them in the FUV range with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Methods. We imaged the target in two FUV filters of the HST's ACS/SBC detector. We also re-analyzed previous optical observations of the pulsar and its BSN. We fit the pulsar's FUV-optical spectrum separately and together with its X-ray spectrum. Results. We found that the pulsar's FUV-optical spectrum consists of a thermal and nonthermal components. A joint fit of the FUV-optical and X-ray spectra with combinations of a nonthermal and thermal components showed a hard optical nonthermal spectrum with a photon index $\Gamma_{opt} \approx 1.0-1.2$ and a softer X-ray component, $\Gamma_X \approx 2.6-2.7$. The thermal emission is dominated by the cold component with the temperature $kT_{cold}\approx 40-50$ eV and emitting sphere radius $R_{cold}\approx 8-15$ km, at $d=270$ pc. An additional hot thermal component, with $kT_{hot}\sim 80$ eV and $R_{hot}\sim 1$ km, is also possible. Such a spectrum resembles the spectra of other middle-aged pulsars, but it shows a harder (softer) optical (X-ray) nonthermal spectrum. We detected the FUV BSN, the first one associated with a middle-aged pulsar. Its closed-shell morphology is similar to the H$\alpha$ BSN morphology, while its FUV flux, $\sim10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, is a factor of $\sim 4$ higher than the H$\alpha$ flux. This FUV BSN has a higher surface brightness than the two previously known ones.</description>

      <title>$\nu$ limits from Super-Kamiokande on dark matter-electron scattering in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle dark matter scattering on electrons in the Sun may gravitationally capture and self-annihilate inside it to neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, or other final states that in turn decay to them. Using up-to-date measurements by Super-Kamiokande of the fluxes of atmospheric electron-type and muon-type neutrinos, we set the most stringent limits on the electron scattering cross sections of dark matter down to about $10^{-40}-10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ over a mass range of 4$-$200 GeV. These outdo direct searches for dark matter-electron scattering and previously set limits at IceCube. We also derive corresponding reaches at Hyper-K, and show that atmospheric neutrino observations restricted to the direction of the Sun can improve sensitivities.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Subcycling Time Integration with the Einstein Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) with subcycling in time enables different grid levels to advance using their own time steps, ensuring finer grids employ smaller steps for accuracy while coarser grids take larger steps to improve computational efficiency. We present the development, validation, and performance analysis of a subcycling in time algorithm implemented within the CarpetX driver in the Einstein Toolkit framework. This new approach significantly improves upon the previous subcycling implementation in the Carpet driver by achieving higher-order convergence -- fourth order in time instead of second order -- and enhanced scaling performance. The key innovation lies in optimizing the exchange of ghost points at refinement boundaries, limiting it to the same number as those at inter-process boundaries using dense output from coarser levels, thereby reducing computational and communication overhead compared to the implementation in Carpet, which required a larger number of buffer zones.
  To validate the algorithm, we first demonstrate its fourth-order convergence using a scalar wave test. We then apply the algorithm to binary black hole (BBH) simulations, confirming its robustness and accuracy in a realistic astrophysical scenario. The results show excellent agreement with the well-established LazEv code. Scaling tests on CPU (Frontera) and GPU (Vista) clusters reveal significant performance gains, with the new implementation achieving improved speed and scalability compared to the Carpet-based version.</description>

      <title>Probing the Axion-Electron Coupling with NuSTAR Observations of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for the existence of ultralight axions coupling to electrons and photons using data from the NuSTAR telescope directed toward the galaxies M82, M87, and M31. We focus on electron bremsstrahlung and Compton scattering for axion production in stars, summing over the stellar populations found in the target galaxies when computing the axion luminosity. We then compute the hard X-ray signal that arises from the conversion of these axions to photons in each galaxy's magnetic fields, inferred from analog galaxies in cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Analyzing NuSTAR data toward these galaxies between roughly 20 to 70 keV, we find no evidence for axions and set leading constraints on the combined axion-electron and axion-photon coupling at the level of $|g_{aee} \times g_{a \gamma \gamma}| \lesssim 8.3 \times 10^{-27}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV at 95% confidence, with M82 providing the most stringent constraints.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV Dark Matter Direct Detection with Neutrino Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new technique for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) searches and a new use of neutrino observatories. DM-electron scattering can excite or ionize target molecules in the observatory, which then produce light that can be detected by its photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). While individual DM scatterings are undetectable, the aggregate rate from many independent scatterings can be isolated from the total PMT dark rate using the expected DM annual modulation. We showcase this technique with the example of JUNO, a 20,000 ton scintillator detector, showing that its sensitivity in some mass ranges exceeds all other techniques and reaches key particle-theory targets.</description>

      <title>New Supernova Constraints on Neutrinophilic Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernova cooling has long been used to constrain physics beyond the Standard Model, typically involving new mediators or dark matter (DM) particles that couple to nucleons or electrons. In this work, we show that the large density of neutrinos inside the neutrinosphere of supernovae also makes them powerful laboratories to study nonstandard neutrino interactions with a {\it neutrinophilic} dark sector, i.e.~DM and mediator particles interacting primarily with neutrinos. In this case, we find that the existing constraints are rather weak, and for a wide range of currently unconstrained parameter space, neutrino annihilation within a supernova could copiously produce such neutrinophilic DM at a large enough rate to cause noticeable anomalous cooling. From the non-observation of such anomalous cooling in SN1987A, we thus set new constraints on neutrino-DM interactions, which provide up to four orders of magnitude improvement over the existing constraints for DM masses below ${\cal O}$(100 MeV).</description>

      <title>Further constraining the neutron star-black hole merger rate</title>

Abstract: Current template-based gravitational-wave searches for compact binary mergers neglect the general relativistic phenomenon of spin-induced orbital precession. Owing to their asymmetric masses, gravitational-waves from neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries are prime candidates for displaying strong imprints of spin-precession. As a result, current searches may be missing a significant fraction of the astrophysical population, and the detected NSBH population may be significantly suppressed or biased. Here we report the most sensitive search for NSBH binaries to date by including spin-precession for the first time. We analyze data from the entirety of the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave observing run and show that when accounting for spin-precession, our search is up to 100% more sensitive than the search techniques currently adopted by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration (for systems with strong precessional effects). This allows us to more tightly constrain the rate of NSBH mergers in the local Universe. Firstly, we focus on a precessing subpopulation of NSBH mergers; the lack of observed candidates allows us to place an upper limit on the merger rate of $R_{90} = 79\, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with 90% confidence. Secondly, we tighten the overall rate of NSBH mergers; we show that if there is no preferred direction of component spin, the rate of NSBH mergers is on average 16% smaller than previously believed. Finally, we report four new subthreshold NSBH candidates, all with strong imprints of spin precession, but note that these are most likely to be of terrestrial origin.</description>

      <title>Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</description>

      <title>A demarcation criterion for hydrogen burning of millinovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millinovae are a new class of transient supersoft X-ray sources with no clear signature of mass ejection. They show similar triangle shapes of $V/I$ band light curves with thousand times fainter peaks than typical classical novae. Maccarone et al. regarded the prototype millinova, ASASSN-16oh, as a dwarf nova and interpreted the supersoft X-rays to originate from an accretion belt on a white dwarf (WD). Kato et al. proposed a nova model induced by a high-rate mass-accretion during a dwarf nova outburst; the X-rays originate from the photosphere of a hydrogen-burning hot WD whereas the $V/I$ band photons are from the irradiated accretion disk. Because each peak brightness differs largely from millinova to millinova, we suspect that not all the millinova candidates host a hydrogen burning WD. Based on the light curve analysis of the classical nova KT Eri that has a bright disk, we find that the disk is more than two magnitudes brighter when the disk is irradiated by the hydrogen burning WD than when not irradiated. We present the demarcation criterion for hydrogen burning to be $I_{\rm q} - I_{\rm max} &gt; 2.2$, where $I_q$ and $I_{\rm max}$ are the $I$ magnitudes in quiescence and at maximum light, respectively. Among many candidates, this requirement is satisfied with the two millinovae in which soft X-rays were detected.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modeling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$($-11.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.65$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-based Cosmic-Ray (CR) observatory with the aim, among others, to study Cosmic-Ray Electrons (CREs) up to 10 TeV. Due to the low CRE rate at multi-TeV energies, we aim to increasing the acceptance by selecting events outside the fiducial volume. The complex topology of non-fiducial events requires the development of a novel energy reconstruction method. We propose the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks for a regression task to recover an accurate estimation of the initial energy.</description>

      <title>Radiative Acceleration and X-ray Spectrum of Outflowing Pure Electron-Positron Pair Fireball in Magnetar Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An X-ray short burst associated with a Galactic fast radio burst was observed in 2020, distinguished by its X-ray cut-off energy significantly exceeding that of other X-ray short bursts. X-ray photons of these short bursts are believed to originate from fireballs within the magnetospheres of magnetars. If a fireball forms near a magnetic pole, it expands along the magnetic field lines, subsequently emitting photons and generating plasma outflows that may account for the observed radio bursts. We numerically study the radiative acceleration and X-ray spectrum of such outflowing fireballs consisting of pure electron-positron pairs and radiation, employing spherically symmetric relativistic radiation hydrodynamics calculations with the effects of strong magnetic fields. Using Monte-Carlo scheme in the radiation calculation, we consistently incorporate both the acceleration of the fluid by radiation and the scattering of radiation by the fluid, both of which are enhanced by the cyclotron resonant scattering. Our calculation reveals that cyclotron resonant scattering accelerates the plasma outflow significantly and broadens the X-ray spectrum. The plasma outflow is accelerated up to ultra-relativistic velocities, with Lorentz factors exceeding 100. The calculated X-ray spectrum broadened due to the scattering is similar to the observed X-ray spectrum in the Galactic fast radio burst.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the population properties of merging black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Third-generation gravitational-wave detectors will observe up to millions of merging binary black holes. With such a vast dataset, stacking events into population analyses will arguably be more important than analyzing single sources. We present the first application of population-level Fisher-matrix forecasts tailored to third-generation gravitational-wave interferometers. We implement the formalism first derived by Gair et al. and explore how future experiments such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will constrain the distributions of black-hole masses, spins, and redshift. Third-generation detectors will be transformative, improving constraints on the population hyperparameters by several orders of magnitude compared to current data. At the same time, we highlight that a single third-generation observatory and a network of detectors will deliver qualitatively similar performances. Obtaining precise measurements of some population features (e.g. peaks in the mass spectrum) will require only a few months of observations while others (e.g. the fraction of binaries with aligned spins) will instead require years if not decades. We argue population forecasts of this kind should be featured in white papers and feasibility studies aimed at developing the science case of future gravitational-wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Induced Compton scattering in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A formulation for the parametric instability of electromagnetic (EM) waves in magnetized pair plasma is developed. The linear growth rate of induced Compton scattering is derived analytically for frequencies below the cyclotron frequency for the first time. We identify three modes of density fluctuation: ordinary, charged, and neutral modes. In the charged mode, the ponderomotive force separates charges (electrons and positrons) longitudinally, in contrast to the nonmagnetized case. We also recognize two effects that significantly reduce the scattering rate for waves polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field: (1) the gyroradius effect due to the magnetic suppression of particle orbits, and (2) Debye screening for wavelengths larger than the Debye length. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs), we find that these effects facilitate the escape of X-mode waves from the magnetosphere and outflow of a magnetar and neutron star, enabling 100\% polarization as observed. Our formulation provides a foundation for consistently addressing the nonlinear interaction of EM waves with magnetized plasma in astrophysics and laser physics.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon: The 1CGH Catalogue of Fermi-LAT detections above 10 GeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the First Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon (1CGH) catalogue, featuring $\gamma$-ray detections above 10 GeV based on 16 years of observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) satellite. After carefully selecting a sample of blazars and blazar candidates from catalogues in the literature, we performed a binned likelihood analysis and identified 2791 $\gamma$-ray emitters above 10 GeV, at &gt;3$\sigma$ level, including 62 that are new $\gamma$-ray detections. For each source, we estimated the mean energy of the highest-energy bin and analysed them in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon. By adopting a reference model for the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), we identified a subsample of 525 sources where moderate to severe $\gamma$-ray absorption could be detected across the redshift range of 0 to 3. This work provides the most up-to-date compilation of detections above 10 GeV, along with their redshift information. We condense extensive results from the literature, including reports on observational campaigns dedicated to blazars and $\gamma$-ray sources, thereby delivering an unprecedented review of the redshift information for sources detected above 10 GeV. Additionally, we highlight key 1CGH sources where redshift information remains incomplete, offering guidance for future optical observation campaigns. The 1CGH catalogue aims to track the most significant sources for studying the $\gamma$-ray transparency of the Universe. Furthermore, it provides a targeted subsample where the EBL optical depth, $\tau_{(E,z)}$, can be robustly measured using Fermi-LAT data.</description>

      <title>Quenching and recovery of persistent X-ray emission during a superburst in 4U 1820$-$30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the superburst from 4U 1820--30 in 2021 observed by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). During the tail of the superburst, we found that the NICER light curve unexpectedly increased from 1080 to 2204 ${\rm counts~s^{-1}}$ over 6.89 hr. From the time-resolved superburst spectra, we estimated the burst decay time of $\approx2.5$ hr, the ignition column depth of $\approx0.3\times 10^{12}~{\rm g ~cm^{-2}}$, the energy release per unit mass of $\approx2.4\times 10^{17}~{\rm erg~g^{-1}}$, the fluence of $\approx4.1\times 10^{-4}~{\rm erg~cm^{-2}}$, and the total energy release of $\approx3.5\times10^{42}$ erg. Notably, we found a gradual increase in the Componization flux from $8.9\times 10^{-10}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$ to the preburst level during the superburst. This increase can be interpreted as a consequence of superburst radiation depleting the inner accretion disk, leading to a near-complete quenching of the persistent emission. As the burst radiation decayed, the inner accretion disk gradually returned to its preburst state, as evidenced by the best-fit spectral parameters. Additionally, we observed a prominent absorption line that exhibited a gravitational redshift, shifting from 4.15 to 3.62 keV during the recovery phase of persistent emission. This absorption feature likely originates from the inner accretion disk rather than from burst emission on the neutron star (NS) surface. The observed changes in the absorption line energy suggest that the inner disk approached the NS to a distance as close as $\approx17$ km.</description>

      <title>Rotating and swirling binary black hole system balanced by its gravitational spin-spin interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first exact and analytical solution representing an equilibrium configuration of two stationary black holes, in general relativity, is presented. The metric models two collinear extremal Kerr black holes immersed into an external and back-reacting rotating tidal drag. The gravitational attraction is balanced by the repulsive gravitational spin-spin interaction generated by the interplay between black holes angular momenta with the rotational background. The new solution is built by embedding the double Kerr metric into a swirling universe by means of the Ehlers transformation. The geometry is completely regular outside the event horizons. Thermodynamic properties of the binary black hole system are studied, the Smarr law, the first law and the Christodoulou-Ruffini formulas are verified. Microscopic degrees of freedom of the entropy are computed from the dual CFT living on the boundary of the near horizon geometries.</description>
