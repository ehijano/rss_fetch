      <title>Global Near-Inertial Wave Spectra Shaped by Mesoscale Eddies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind-forced near-inertial waves (NIWs) propagate through a sea of mesoscale eddies, which can fundamentally alter their evolution. The nature of this NIW--mesoscale interaction depends on how dispersive the waves are. For weakly dispersive waves, ray tracing suggests that the NIW frequency should be shifted by $\frac{1}{2}\zeta$, where $\zeta$ is the mesoscale vorticity, and that the waves are refracted into anticyclones. Strongly dispersive waves, in contrast, retain the large-scale structure of the wind forcing and exhibit a small negative frequency shift. Previous in situ observational studies have indeed revealed varying degrees of NIW--mesoscale interaction. Here, observations of NIWs from drifters are used to map the geography of NIW--mesoscale interactions globally, and idealized simulations and a simple model are used to identify the underlying physical processes. Almost everywhere in the ocean, with the notable exception of the North Pacific, the NIW frequency is strongly modulated by the mesoscale vorticity, with the slope of the frequency shift vs. vorticity taking values of approximately $0.4$. Concentration of NIW energy into anticyclones is a common feature throughout the ocean. Other aspects of the observations, however, show signatures of strongly dispersive waves: a negative frequency shift and weaker concentration into anticyclones in regions with strong eddies as well as weak modulation of the NIW frequency by mesoscale eddies in the North Pacific. The signatures of both weakly and strongly dispersive NIW behavior can be rationalized by the geography of the wave dispersiveness and the fact that wind forcing excites multiple vertical modes with different wave dispersiveness. These results have implications for NIW-induced mixing in the upper-ocean.</description>

      <title>Taylors hypothesis and its impact on flux measurements in a forest clearcut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taylors hypothesis is the backbone to convert observations done over time to spatial information of the flow while carrying out turbulence measurements on a micrometeorological tower. To address its validity over a highly heterogeneous forest clearcut surface, we utilize an extensive Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Eddy Covariance (EC) datasets. The DTS measured space-time correlation curves of temperature fluctuations are used to compute the bulk convective speeds of temperature structures in buoyant conditions at a height of 3.1 m above the clearing. These convective speeds are compared with the mean wind speed and turbulent intensities of streamwise velocities obtained from the EC system at the middle of the clearcut. Depending on if is parallel or perpendicular to the forest edge, the relationships between and are significantly different. However, irrespective of the wind direction, the convective speeds of temperature structures at inertial subrange scales behave in a power-law fashion with increasing wavenumbers. The exponent of this power-law differs from a homogeneous atmospheric surface layer flow, thereby pointing towards the effects of heterogeneity. The scale-dependent convective speeds non-linearly transform the temporal frequencies to streamwise wavenumbers, which, eventually, impacts the properties of turbulence (co) spectra. More importantly, this non-linear transformation yields a critical frequency limit, beyond which the eddy length scales derived from frequencies are smaller than the physical dimension of the sonic anemometers, and therefore, cannot be faithfully resolved. This critical limit questions the EC flux estimates beyond this frequency.</description>

      <title>Revealing wave-wave resonant interactions in ocean wind waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean wind waves are a fundamental manifestation of complex dynamics in geophysical fluid systems, characterized by a rich interplay between dispersion and nonlinearity. While linear wave theory provides a first-order description of wave motion, real-world oceanic environments are governed by nonlinear interactions that are responsible for a transfer of energy between waves of different lengths. The pioneering research by O. Phillips, K. Hasselmann, and V. Zakharov in the 1960s introduced the concept that four-wave resonant interactions serve as the primary mechanism for energy transfers among wave components in oceanic surface wave fields. Although the presence and efficiency of these resonant interactions have been demonstrated in controlled determinist wave tank experiments, their direct identification in the real ocean, where a large number of random waves interact, has remained elusive. Here, using a stereoscopic system that enables the measurement of surface elevation in both space and time, we provide experimental evidence of resonant interactions in ocean wind waves. Our data not only reproduce the well-known figure-eight pattern predicted by Phillips, but also reveal a continuum of different resonant configurations that closely match the theoretical predictions. These findings support the validity of third-generation ocean wave models, strengthening their ability to accurately capture wave dynamics in the ocean</description>

      <title>Simultaneous observations of multiple ELVES and SPRITES at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2014, the Pierre Auger Observatory has exploited a dedicated trigger and its very high time resolution to study ELVES and harvest record samples of multiple ELVES using the Fluorescence Detector (FD). In 2017, after extending the readout of trace lengths to 0.9 ms, we started observing other types of light transients from the base of the ionosphere, such as HALOS, which deserved further investigation. In December 2023 and April 2024, we installed two additional cameras (TLECAMs), which allow us to perform simultaneous detection of these transients with higher space resolution and longer integration times. Here, we present our first simultaneous observations of SPRITES and ELVES by both TLECAMs and FD. Furthermore, we describe the Python algorithm based on DBSCAN to automatically detect SPRITES in the videos recorded by our TLECAMs and acquire data efficiently without needing the FD trigger.</description>

      <title>FourCastNet 3: A geometric approach to probabilistic machine-learning weather forecasting at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable, geometric machine learning (ML) approach to probabilistic ensemble forecasting. The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3 delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8 to 60 times faster than these approaches. In contrast to other ML approaches, FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on 1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model- and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a single GPU, producing a 90-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly resolution in under 20 seconds. Its computational efficiency, medium-range probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting and early warning systems through large ensemble predictions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Anisotropy-based Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory over Canopies and Complex Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monin Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) has long served as the basis for parameterizations of turbulence exchange between the surface and the atmospheric boundary layer in models for weather and climate prediction. Decades of research, however, has illuminated some of the limitations of MOST based surface layer parameterizations, particularly when MOST's foundational assumptions of flat and horizontally homogeneous terrain are violated. Recent work has leveraged the anisotropy of turbulence as an additional non-dimensional term to extend and generalize MOST to complex terrain. In this work, we examine the performance of this generalized MOST for the scaling of velocity variances, refit these scalings, and study key characteristics of turbulence anisotropy across the 47 towers in the wide ranging National Ecological Observation Network (NEON). NEON in particular covers a diverse selection of ecosystems, from the arctic circle to tropical islands, and as such expands the previous generalized MOST to vegetated canopies and other environments not examined in previous studies. The work finds that anisotropy generalized MOST readily extends to these new environments, with robust performance across seasons over a wide range of canopy and terrain configurations. Results also further illuminate velocity variance scaling across degrees and forms (one-component and two-component) of anisotropy, relate the degree of anisotropy to key environmental characteristics, and evaluate scaling differences between canopies and non-vegetated surfaces across atmospheric conditions, seasons and the diurnal cycle. Overall, this study expands our understanding of the complexity of turbulence while paving the way for improved surface layer parameterizations.</description>
