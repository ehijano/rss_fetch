      <title>Elongation of material lines and vortices by Euler flows on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of the differential geometry of the flow domain on the motion of fluids on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, particularly on the elongation of material lines and vortices. We derive a formula for the second order time derivative of the square of the distance between close fluid particles and show that a curvature term appears. The elongation of a material line is accelerated by negative curvature. The use of this expression extends Haller's definition of hyperbolic domains to flows on curved surfaces. The need to consider curvature effects is illustrated by three examples. The example of a curved two-dimensional torus implies that the filamentation of vortices can be triggered by negative curvature.</description>

      <title>Weak Solutions to a Sharp Interface Model for a Two-Phase Flow of Incompressible Viscous Fluids with Different Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the flow of two incompressible, viscous and immiscible fluids in a bounded domain, with different densities and viscosities. This model consists of a coupled system of Navier-Stokes and Mullins-Sekerka type parts, and can be obtained from the sharp interface limit of the diffuse interface model proposed by the first author, Garcke, and Gr\"{u}n (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 22, 2012). We introduce a new notion of weak solutions and prove its global in time existence, together with a consistency result of smooth weak solutions with the classical Navier-Stokes-Mullins-Sekerka system. Our new notion of solution allows to include the case of different densities of the two fluids, a sharp energy dissipation principle \`a la De Giorgi, together with a weak formulation of the constant contact angle condition at the boundary, which were left open in the previous notion of solution proposed by the first author and R\"{o}ger (Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e Anal. Non Lin\'eaire 26, 2009).</description>

      <title>Differential inclusion systems with fractional competing operator and multivalued fractional convection term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the existence of solutions (in a suitable sense) to a family of inclusion systems involving fractional, possibly competing, elliptic operators, fractional convection, and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is established. The technical approach exploits Galerkin's method and a surjective results for multifunctions in finite dimensional spaces as well as approximating techniques.</description>

      <title>To what extent does the consideration of positive total flux influence the dynamics of Keller-Segel-type models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of the Keller-Segel model in 1970 to describe chemotaxis (the interactions between cell distributions u and chemical distributions v), there has been a significant proliferation of research articles exploring various extensions and modifications of this model within the scientific community. From a technical standpoint, the totality of results concerning these variants are characterized by the assumption that the total flux, involving both distributions, of the model under consideration is zero. This research aims to present a novel perspective by focusing on models with a positive total flux. Specifically, by employing Robin-type boundary conditions for u and v, we seek to gain insights into the interactions between cells and their environment, uncovering important dynamics such as how variations in boundary conditions influence chemotactic behavior. In particular, the choice of the boundary conditions is motivated by real-world phenomena and by the fact that the related analysis reveals some interesting properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the weak formulation of a coupled nonlinear parabolic system modeling a heat exchanger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the existence, uniqueness and time-space regularity of the weak solution to a nonlinear coupled parabolic system modeling temperature evolution in a coaxial heat exchanger with source terms and spatially varying coefficients. The system is formulated in a weak sense and the analysis relies on a Faedo-Galerkin method tailored to handle the nonlinear coupling and heterogeneous domains. Under suitable assumptions on the initial data and source terms, enhanced regularity in both time and space is obtained. In contrast with classical scalar models, the study addresses a multi-component system with realistic boundary conditions and complex interfacial dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for a system of quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for a system of quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations introduced by M. Colin and T. Colin (2004) as a model of laser-plasma interaction. Under the condition that the flow map fails to be twice differentiable, Hirayama, Kinoshita, and Okamoto (2022) proved the well-posedness by constructing a modified energy and applying the energy method. In the present paper, we improve the well-posedness result under the above condition by using the short-time Fourier restriction norm method.</description>

      <title>Transverse linear stability of line solitons for 2D Toda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $2$-dimensional Toda lattice ($2$D Toda) is a completely integrable semi-discrete wave equation with the KP-II equation in its continuous limit. Using Darboux transformations, we prove the linear stability of $1$-line solitons for $2$D Toda of any size in an exponentially weighted space. We prove that the dominant part of solutions to the linearized equation around a $1$-line soliton is a time derivative of the $1$-line soliton multiplied by a function of time and transverse variables. The amplitude is described by a $1$-dimensional damped wave equation in the transverse variable, as is the case with the linearized KP-II equation.</description>

      <title>On Arnold's second stability theorem for two-dimensional steady ideal flows in a bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a steady flow of a two-dimensional ideal fluid, the gradient vectors of the stream function $\psi$ and of its vorticity $\omega$ are collinear. Arnold's second stability theorem states that the flow is Lyapunov stable if $0&lt;\nabla\omega/\nabla\psi&lt;C_{ar}$ for some $C_{ar}&gt;0$. In this paper, we show that $C_{ar}$ can be chosen as $\bm\Lambda_1,$ the first eigenvalue of $-\Delta$ in the space of mean-zero functions that are piecewise constant on the boundary. When $\nabla\omega/\nabla\psi$ is allowed to reach $\bm\Lambda_1$, instability may occur, as illustrated by a non-circular steady flow in a disk; however, we show that certain structural stability still holds. As an application, we establish a general stability criterion for steady flows in a disk.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and exponential decay of strong solution for the three-dimensional inhomogeneous incompressible micropolar equations with density-dependent transport coefficients and large initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Dirichlet problem of three-dimensional inhomogeneous incompressible micropolar equations with density-dependent viscosity. Under the assumption that the coefficients are power functions of the density, we establish the global existence of strong solutions as long as the initial density is linear equivalent to a large constant state. There is no restriction on the size of initial velocity and micro-rotational velocity. As a by-product, we prove the exponential decay for the solution.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior of the reduced Maxwell-Bloch equations in the sharp-line limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the reduced Maxwell-Bloch equations with initial data for the electric field in weighted Sobolev spaces, assuming that all atoms initially reside in their ground state. Using the d-bar steepest descent method, we derive long-time asymptotic expansions of the solutions, including both the electric field and the components of the Bloch vector, within any fixed cone. In particular, we formulate the inverse scattering transform as a properly posed Riemann-Hilbert problem, avoiding singularities in the scattering data by modifying the time evolution of the reflection coefficient. Under assumptions that allow only soliton generation, the leading-order asymptotics are determined by solitons inside the cone, while soliton-radiation interactions appear in lower-order terms. These results extend the applicability of the nonlinear steepest descent method to integrable systems with singularities in the associated Lax pair.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for higher order Schr\"odinger operator with zero singularities in low odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $L^p$-bounds of wave operators for higher-order Schr\"odinger operators $H = (-\Delta)^m + V$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $m \ge 2$ and real-valued decaying potentials $V$. Our main objective is to establish the sharp $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ in the presence of all types of zero-resonance singularities, for all odd dimensions $1 \le n \le 4m - 1$.
  Specifically, for odd $n$ with $1 \le n \le 4m - 1$, there exist $m_n$ types of zero resonances for $H$, along with a critical type $k_c$ (both depending on $n$ and $m$). If zero is a regular point of $H$ or a $\mathbf{k}$-th kind resonance with $1 \le \mathbf{k} \le k_c$, the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. If zero is a $\mathbf{k}$-th kind resonance with $k_c &lt; \mathbf{k} \le m_n$, we show that the range of $p$-boundedness for $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ narrows to $1 &lt; p &lt; p_{\mathbf{k}}$, where $$p_{\mathbf{k}} = \frac{n}{n - 2m + \mathbf{k} + k_c - 1}.$$ Additionally, if zero is an eigenvalue of $H$ (i.e., $\mathbf{k} = m_n + 1$), then $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \frac{2n}{n - 1}$.
  Furthermore, it is shown that the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ are unbounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $p_{\mathbf{k}} &lt; p \le \infty$ if $k_c &lt; \mathbf{k} \le m_n$, and for all $\frac{2n}{n - 1} &lt; p \le \infty$ if zero is an eigenvalue of $H$ with a non-zero solution $\phi$ to $H\phi = 0$ in $\bigcap_{s &lt; -\frac{1}{2}} L^{2}_{s}(\mathbb{R}^n) \setminus L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$(referred to as a $p$-wave resonance). The key idea of the proof is to reduce the $L^p$-unboundedness to establishing the optimality of time-decay estimates for $e^{itH}P_{ac}(H)$ in weighted $L^2$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Rate of Convergence for a Nonlocal-to-local Limit in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal approximation of the quadratic porous medium equation where the pressure is given by a convolution with a mollification kernel. It is known that when the kernel concentrates around the origin, the nonlocal equation converges to the local one. In one spatial dimension, for a particular choice of the kernel, and under mere assumptions on the initial condition, we quantify the rate of convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance. Our proof is very simple, exploiting the so-called Evolutionary Variational Inequality for both the nonlocal and local equations as well as a priori estimates. We also present numerical simulations using the finite volume method, which suggests that the obtained rate can be improved - this will be addressed in a forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Existence of Bianchi-Egnell stability extremizer for the Hardy-Sobolev inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the best Bianchi-Egnell constant for the Hardy-Sobolev (HS) inequality \begin{align*} C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}(\gamma) := \inf_{{u \ \small \mbox{not an optimizer}}} \frac{\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \left(|\nabla u|^2 - \frac{\gamma}{|x|^2}u^2\right) \ {\rm d}x - S_{\gamma}\|u\|_{L^{2^{\star}}}^2}{\mbox{dist} (u, \ \mbox{set of optimizers})^2}, \end{align*} is attained, extending the result of K\"onig [arXiv:2211.14185] for the classical Sobolev inequality (that corresponds to $\gamma = 0$). One of the main difficulties is that the third eigenspace of the linearized operator may contain only spherical harmonics of degree $1$, and hence, an essential non-vanishing criterion fails [arXiv:2210.08482]. This non-vanishing criterion is indispensable for proving the best Bianchi-Egnell constant $C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}(\gamma) &lt; C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}^{\tiny\mbox{{loc}}}(\gamma)$ that prevents a minimizing sequence converging to one of the optimizers. In addition, not being translation invariant, extracting a non-zero weak limit from a minimizing sequence presents difficulties. We found another hidden critical level $C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}(\gamma) &lt;1 - \frac{S_{\gamma}}{S},$ where $S$ is the best Sobolev constant that plays a significant role in proving the existence of an extremizer. In particular, we show that there exists a $\gamma_0&gt;0$ such that for $\gamma \geq \gamma_0,\ C_{\tiny\mbox{{BE}}}(\gamma)$ is attained. Moreover, we remark that there is a region $\gamma_0 \leq \gamma &lt; \gamma_c^{\star},$ where the third eigenspace of the linearized operator contains only spherical harmonics of degree $1.$ Our result improves some of the results in Wei-Wu [arXiv:2308.04667] corresponding to the HS inequality.</description>

      <title>Well-posed geometric boundary data in General Relativity, II: Dirichlet boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second work in a series, we prove the local-in-time well-posedness of the IBVP for the vacuum Einstein equations with Dirichlet boundary data on a finite timelike boundary, provided the Brown-York stress tensor of the boundary is a Lorentz metric of the same sign as the induced Lorentz metric on the boundary. This is a convexity-type assumption which is an exact analog of a similar result in the Riemannian setting. This assumption on the (extrinsic) Brown-York tensor cannot be dropped in general.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and global attractor for wave equation with displacement dependent damping and super-cubic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the semilinear wave equation featuring the displacement dependent term $\sigma(u)\partial_t u $ and nonlinearity $f(u)$. By developing refined space-time a priori estimates under extended ranges of the nonlinearity exponents with $\sigma(u)$ and $f(u)$, the well-posedness of the weak solution is established. Furthermore, the existence of a global attractor in the naturally phase space $H^1_0(\Omega)\times L^2(\Omega)$ is obtained. Moreover, the regularity of the global attractor is established, implying that it is a bounded subset of $(H^2(\Omega)\cap H^1_0(\Omega))\times H^1_0(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Carleman estimates for the Korteweg-de Vries equation with piecewise constant main coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate observability-related properties of the Korteweg-de Vries equation with a discontinuous main coefficient, coupled by suitable interface conditions. The main result is a novel two-parameter Carleman estimate for the linear equation with internal observation, assuming a monotonicity condition on the main coefficient. As a primary application, we establish the local exact controllability to the trajectories by employing a duality argument for the linear case and a local inversion theorem for the nonlinear equation. Secondly, we establish the Lipschitz-stability of the inverse problem of retrieving an unknown potential using the Bukhge{\u\i}m-Klibanov method, when some further assumptions on the interface are made. We conclude with some remarks on the boundary observability.</description>

      <title>Global small-time approximate null and Lagrangian controllability of the viscous non-resistive MHD system in a $3D$ domain with Navier type boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the incompressible viscous MHD system without magnetic diffusion in a $3D$ bounded domain with Navier type boundary condition. We establish the global small-time approximate null controllability and the Lagrangian controllability of the system, in the class of smooth solutions, by following the approach initiated in \cite{CMS} to establish the global small-time null controllability of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the class of weak solutions and extended in \cite{LSZ1} to establish the global small-time null and Lagrangian controllability of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the class of strong solutions. This approach makes use of controls with an extra fast scale in time and some corresponding multi-scale asymptotic expansions of the controlled solution. This expansion is constructed by an iterative process which requires some regularity. The extra-difficulty here is that the MHD system at stake is mixed hyperbolic-parabolic, without any regularizing effect on the magnetic field. Despite our strategy makes use of a quite precise asymptotic expansion, we succeed to cover the case where the initial velocity belongs the Sobolev space $H^{24}$ and the initial magnetic field belongs to the Sobolev space $H^8$.</description>

      <title>On the energy decay estimates for the weak dissipative wave equations with oscillating coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the asymptotic behavior of time-dependent dissipative coefficient in the Cauchy problem of dissipative wave equation dominates the energy decay estimate. In particular, it is important to study the case where the dissipative coefficient behave like $1/t$ as $t$ goes to infinity, which is called weak dissipation, because its order is close to the critical case of decay and non-decay. In this case, an oscillating perturbation of weak dissipation can give a crucial effect on the energy decay estimate, but the analysis is very difficult compared to the case without oscillations. In this paper, we develop a method recently introduce by Ghisi-Gobbino that has contributed to a precise analysis for dissipative wave equations with oscillating weak dissipation, and consider the effect of the oscillations, which is more general and close to the critical case. Furthermore, we study the effect of the smoothness of the initial data on the energy decay estimates.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for wave equation of memory type with acoustic boundary conditions: Global solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the one-dimensional inverse problem of determining the memory kernel by the integral overdetermination condition for the direct problem of finding the velocity potential and the displacement of boundary points. A wave equation with initial and acoustic boundary conditions in media with dispersion is used as a mathematical model. The inverse problem is reduced to an equivalent problem with homogeneous boundary conditions for the system of integro-differential equations. Using the technique of estimating integral equations and the contraction mappings principle in Sobolev spaces, the global existence and uniqueness theorem for the inverse problem is proved.</description>

      <title>On inverse dynamical and spectral problems for the wave and Schr\"odinger equations on finite trees. The leaf peeling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in inverse dynamical, spectral and scattering problems for differential equations on graphs is motivated by possible applications to nano-electronics and quantum waveguides and by a variety of other classical and quantum applications. Recently a new effective leaf peeling method has been proposed by S. Avdonin and P. Kurasov \cite{AK} for solving inverse problems on trees (graphs without cycles). It allows recalculating efficiently the inverse data from the original tree to the smaller trees, `removing' leaves step by step up to the rooted edge. In this paper we describe the main step of the spectral and dynamical versions of the peeling algorithm -- recalculating the inverse data for the `peeled tree'.</description>

      <title>The formation of gradient-driven singular structures of codimension one and two in two-dimensions: The case study of ferronematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional variational model for ferronematics -- composite materials formed by dispersing magnetic nanoparticles into a liquid crystal matrix. The model features two coupled order parameters: a Landau-de Gennes~$\mathbf{Q}$-tensor for the liquid crystal component and a magnetisation vector field~$\mathbf{M}$, both of them governed by a Ginzburg-Landau-type energy. The energy includes a singular coupling term favouring alignment between~$\mathbf{Q}$ and~$\mathbf{M}$. We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of (not necessarily minimizing) critical points as a small parameter~$\varepsilon$ tends to zero. Our main results show that the energy concentrates along distinct singular sets: the (rescaled) energy density for the~$\mathbf{Q}$-component concentrates, to leading order, on a finite number of singular points, while the energy density for the~$\mathbf{M}$-component concentrate along a one-dimensional rectifiable set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V, E)$ be a locally finite connected graph satisfying curvature-dimension conditions ($CDE(n, 0)$ or its strengthened version $CDE'(n, 0))$) and polynomial volume growth conditions of degree $m$. We systematically establish sharp $L^{p}$-bounds and decay-type $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ estimates for heat operators on $G$, accommodating both bounded and unbounded Laplacians. The analysis utilizes Li-Yau-type Harnack inequalities and geometric completeness arguments to handle degenerate cases. As a key application, we prove the existence of global solutions to a semilinear parabolic system on $G$ under critical exponents governed by volume growth dimension $m$.</description>

      <title>Probing the speckle to estimate the effective speed of sound, a first step towards quantitative ultrasound imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical model and analysis for a new experimental method [Bureau and al., arXiv:2409.13901, 2024] for effective sound velocity estimation in medical ultrasound imaging. We perform a detailed analysis of the point spread function of a medical ultrasound imaging system when there is a mismatch between the effective sound speed in the medium and the one used in the backpropagation imaging functional. Based on this analysis, an estimator for the speed of sound error is introduced. Using recent results on stochastic homogenization of the Helmholtz equation, we provide a representation formula for the field scattered by a random multi-scale medium (whose acoustic behavior is similar to a biological tissue) in the time-harmonic regime. We then prove that statistical moments of the imaging function can be accessed from data collected with only one realization of the medium. We show that it is possible to locally extract the point spread function from an image constituted only of speckle and build an estimator for the effective sound velocity in the micro-structured medium. Some numerical illustrations are presented at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Positive normalized solutions of Schr\"{o}dinger equations with Sobolev critical growth in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of positive normalized solutions to the Sobolev critical Schr\"{o}dinger equation: \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u +\lambda u =|u|^{2^*-2}u \quad &amp;\mbox{in}&amp; \ \Omega,\\ &amp;\int_{\Omega}|u|^{2}dx=c, \quad u=0 \quad &amp;\mbox{on}&amp; \ \partial\Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}$ ($N\geq3$) is a bounded smooth domain, $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$, $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ is a Lagrange multiplier, and $c&gt;0$ is a prescribed constant. By introducing a novel blow-up analysis for Sobolev subcritical approximation solutions with uniformly bounded Morse index and fixed mass, we establish the existence of mountain pass type positive normalized solutions for
  $N\ge 3$. This resolves an open problem posed in [Pierotti, Verzini and Yu, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 2025].</description>

      <title>Second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids and associated cylindrical flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids, building on the framework introduced by Fried and Gurtin. We propose a new and simple constitutive relation for the hyperpressure to ensure that the models are both physically meaningful and mathematically well-posed. The framework is further extended to incorporate pressure-dependent viscosities. We show that for the pressure-dependent viscosity model, the inclusion of second-gradient effects guarantees the ellipticity of the governing pressure equation, in contrast to previous models rooted in classical continuum mechanics. The constant viscosity model is applied to steady cylindrical flows, where explicit solutions are derived under both strong and weak adherence boundary conditions. In each case, we establish convergence of the velocity profiles to the classical Navier-Stokes solutions as the model's characteristic length scales tend to zero.</description>

      <title>Image Restoration via Integration of Optimal Control Techniques and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel image restoration framework that integrates optimal control techniques with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Motivated by models from production planning, our method restores degraded images by balancing an intervention cost against a state-dependent penalty that quantifies the loss of critical image information. Under the assumption of radial symmetry, the HJB equation is reduced to an ordinary differential equation and solved via a shooting method, from which the optimal feedback control is derived. Numerical experiments, supported by extensive parameter tuning and quality metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvement in image quality. The results not only validate the theoretical model but also suggest promising directions for future research in adaptive and hybrid image restoration techniques.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the stability of Minkowski-type inequalities for hypersurfaces in warped product spaces. We establish a stability estimate that bounds the norm of the traceless second fundamental form of the hypersurface in terms of the deficit in the Minkowski inequalities satisfied by the hypersurface. Additionally, we prove the stability of Minkowski inequalities in specific cases of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) and Anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild (AdS-Schwarzschild) manifolds, which serve as examples of warped products. We also establish a new rigidity result for locally conformally flat manifolds to understand the stability of these inequalities.</description>

      <title>A proof of Onsager's conjecture for the stochastic 3D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations on a periodic domain, driven by an additive stochastic forcing of trace class. First, for any $\vartheta&lt;1/3$, we construct global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $C_tC^{\vartheta}_x$. These solutions dissipate the energy pathwisely up to a stopping time, which can be chosen arbitrarily large with high probability. In addition, we provide a brief proof of energy conservation for $\vartheta&gt;1/3$ based on \cite{CET94}, thereby confirming the Onsager theorem for the stochastic 3D Euler equations. Second, let $0&lt;\bar{\vartheta}&lt;\bar{\beta}&lt;1/3$, we construct infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions in $C_tC_x^{\bar{\vartheta}}$ for any given divergence-free initial condition in $C^{\bar{\beta}}_x$. Our construction relies on the convex integration method developed in the deterministic setting by \cite{Ise18}, adapting it to the stochastic context by combining stochastic analysis and pathwise analysis arguments.</description>

      <title>The Restricted Three-Body Problem as a Perturbed Duffing Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the restricted circular planar three-body problem. We prove that for every negative Jacobi constant of sufficiently large magnitude, the surface of unperturbed parabolic solutions breaks to induce homoclinic tangle for all but at most finitely many mass ratios of primaries. This result is not covered by \cite{G} as the required large magnitude of the Jacobi constant is uniform across the mass ratios.
  Our approach consists of three main ingredients. First, by introducing new coordinate transformations, we reformulate the restricted three-body problem as a perturbed Duffing equation. Second, we adopt the method recently introduced in \cite{CW} to derive integral equations for the primary stable and unstable solutions. This enables us to effectively capture the order of the singularities involved and to further establish the existence and analytic dependence of the invariant manifolds on the mass ratio of the primaries and the Jacobi constant. Third, in evaluating the Poincar\'e-Melnikov integral, we take advantage of the explicit homoclinic solution of the unperturbed Duffing equation.
  Compared to existing works, our proof is significantly simpler and more direct. Moreover, the paper is self-contained: we do not rely on McGehee's analysis in \cite{Mc} to justify the applicability of the Poincar\'e-Melnikov method.</description>

      <title>Weyl laws for exponentially small singular values of the $\overline{\partial}$ operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the number of exponentially small singular values of the semiclassical $\overline{\partial}$ operator on exponentially weighted $L^2$ spaces on the two-dimensional torus. Accurate upper and lower bounds on the number of such singular values are established with the help of auxiliary notions of upper and lower bound weights. Assuming that the Laplacian of the exponential weight changes sign along a curve, we construct optimal such weights by solving a free boundary problem, which yields a Weyl asymptotics for the counting function of the singular values in an interval of the form $[0,\mathrm{e}^{-\tau/h}]$, for $\tau&gt;0$ smaller than the oscillation of the weight. We also provide a precise description of the leading term in the Weyl asymptotics, in the regime of small $\tau &gt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By applying the theory of rough paths, Martin Hairer provided a notion of solution for a class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of Burgers type, driven by additive space-time white noise in one spatial dimension. These equations exhibit spatial roughness that is too severe for classical analytical techniques to handle. Hairer developed a pathwise framework for solutions when the spatial regularity of the solution lies in the range $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}]$. In this paper, we extend Hairer's result by lowering the spatial regularity to the range $(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{3}]$. Specifically, we establish the pathwise existence and uniqueness of mild (and, equivalently, weak) solutions to Burgers-type SPDEs under this lower spatial regularity regime.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Time-Averaged Mean Field Gradient Descent Dynamics for Continuous Multi-Player Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approximation of mixed Nash equilibria (MNE) for zero-sum games with mean-field interacting players has recently raised much interest in machine learning. In this paper we propose a mean-field gradient descent dynamics for finding the MNE of zero-sum games involving $K$ players with $K\geq 2$. The evolution of the players' strategy distributions follows coupled mean-field gradient descent flows with momentum, incorporating an exponentially discounted time-averaging of gradients. First, in the case of a fixed entropic regularization, we prove an exponential convergence rate for the mean-field dynamics to the mixed Nash equilibrium with respect to the total variation metric. This improves a previous polynomial convergence rate for a similar time-averaged dynamics with different averaging factors. Moreover, unlike previous two-scale approaches for finding the MNE, our approach treats all player types on the same time scale. We also show that with a suitable choice of decreasing temperature, a simulated annealing version of the mean-field dynamics converges to an MNE of the initial unregularized problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our recent work [54] concerning the capillary Minkowski problem. We propose, in this paper, a capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem for $p\geq 1$, which seeks to find a capillary convex body with a prescribed capillary $L_p$-surface area measure in the Euclidean half-space. This formulation provides a natural Robin boundary analogue of the classical $L_p$-Minkowski problem introduced by Lutwak [43]. For $p&gt;1$, we resolve the capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem in the smooth category by reducing it to a Monge-Amp\`ere equation with a Robin boundary condition on the unit spherical cap.</description>

      <title>Illposedness via degenerate dispersion for generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equations with singular velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove strong nonlinear illposedness results for the generalized SQG equation $$\partial_t \theta + \nabla^\perp \Gamma[\theta] \cdot \nabla \theta = 0 $$ in any sufficiently regular Sobolev spaces, when $\Gamma$ is a singular in the sense that its symbol satisfies $|\Gamma(\xi)|\to\infty$ as $|\xi|\to\infty$ with some mild regularity assumptions. The key mechanism is degenerate dispersion, i.e., the rapid growth of frequencies of solutions around certain shear states, and the robustness of our method allows one to extend linear and nonlinear illposedness to fractionally dissipative systems, as long as the order of dissipation is lower than that of $\Gamma$. Our illposedness results are completely sharp in view of various existing wellposedness statements as well as those from our companion paper. Key to our proofs is a novel construction of degenerating wave packets for the class of linear equations $$\partial_t \phi + ip(t,X,D)\phi = 0$$ where $p(t,X,D)$ is a pseudo-differential operator which is self-adjoint in $L^2$, degenerate, and dispersive. Degenerating wave packets are approximate solutions to the above linear equation with spatial and frequency support localized at $(X(t),\Xi(t))$, which are solutions to the bicharacteristic ODE system associated with $p(t,x,\xi)$. These wave packets explicitly show degeneration as $X(t)$ approaches a point where $p$ vanishes, which in particular allows us to prove illposedness in topologies finer than $L^2$. While the equation for the wave packet can be formally obtained from a Taylor expansion of the symbol near $\xi=\Xi(t)$, the difficult part is to rigorously control the error in sufficiently long timescales, which is obtained by sharp estimates for not only degenerating wave packets but also for oscillatory integrals which naturally appear in the error estimate.</description>

Abstract: We study a granular model for congested crowd motion and pedestrian flow. Our approach is based on an approximation through a Hele-Shaw type equation involving a degenerate operator of $p$-Laplacian type and a linear drift, for which we prove existence and uniqueness using nonlinear semigroup methods and the doubling variables technique. Our main result shows that, as $p \to \infty$, the weak solutions of the $p-$problem converge to a variational solution of the congested crowd motion problem.</description>

Abstract: We consider a Hele-Shaw model that describes tumor growth subject to nutrient supply. The model is derived by taking the incompressible limit of porous medium type equations, and the boundary instability of this model was recently studied in \cite{feng2022tumor} using asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we further prove the existence of nonsymmetric traveling wave solutions to the model in a two dimensional tube-like domain, which reflect intrinsic boundary instability in tumor growth dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantization property of n-Laplacian mean field equation and sharp Moser-Onofri inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the following $n$-Laplacian mean field equation \[ \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} { - \Delta_n u = \lambda e^u} &amp; {\rm in} \ \ \Omega, \\ {\ \ \ \ u = 0} &amp;\ {\rm on}\ \partial \Omega, \end{array}} \right. \] \[\] where $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n \ (n\geq 2)$ and $- \Delta_n u =-{\rm div}(|\nabla u|^{n-2}\nabla u)$. We first establish the quantization property of solutions to the above $n$-Laplacian mean field equation. As an application, combining the Pohozaev identity and the capacity estimate, we obtain the sharp constant $C(n)$ of the Moser-Onofri inequality in the $n$-dimensional unit ball $B^n:=B^n(0,1)$, $$\mathop {\inf }\limits_{u \in W_0^{1,n}(B^n)}\frac{1}{ n C_n}\int_{B^n} | \nabla u|^n dx- \ln \int_{B^n} {e^u} dx\geq C(n),$$ which extends the result of Caglioti-Lions-Marchioro-Pulvirenti in \cite{Caglioti} to the case of $n$-dimensional ball. Here $C_n=(\frac{n^2}{n-1})^{n-1} \omega_{n-1}$ and $\omega_{n-1}$ is the surface measure of $B^n$. For the Moser-Onofri inequality in a general bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we apply the technique of $n$-harmonic transplantation to give the optimal concentration level of the Moser-Onofri inequality and obtain the criterion for the existence and non-existence of extremals for the Moser-Onofri inequality.</description>

      <title>Exact controllability to eigensolutions of the fractional heat equation via bilinear controls on N-dimensional domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact controllability of heat-type equations in the presence of bilinear controls has been successfully studied in recent works, motivated by numerous applications to engineering, neurobiology, chemistry, and life sciences. Nevertheless, the result has only been achieved for $1$-dimensional domains due to the limitations of the existing techniques. In this work, we consider a fractional heat-type equation as $\partial_t\psi+(-\Delta)^s\psi+\langle v(t), Q\rangle \psi(t)=0$ with $s&gt;0$ and on a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^N$ for $N\in\mathbb N^*.$ We study the so-called exact controllability to the eigensolutions of the equations when $s&gt;\max(\frac{4N}{5},N-1)$. The result is implied by the null controllability of a suitable linearized equation, and the main novelty of the work is the strategy of its proof. First, the null controllability in a finite-dimensional subspace has to be ensured via the solvability of a suitable moment problem. Explicit bounds on the control cost with respect to the dimension of the controlled space are also required. Second, the controllability can be extended to the whole Hilbert space, thanks to the Lebeau-Robbiano-Miller method, when the control cost does not grow too fast with respect to the dimension of the finite-dimensional subspace. We firstly develop our techniques in the general case when suitable hypotheses on the problem are verified. Secondly, we apply our procedure to the bilinear heat equation on rectangular domains, and we ensure its exact controllability to the eigensolutions.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic effects of an anisotropic Gaussian-type repulsive potential: nematic alignment and spatial effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elongated particles in dense systems often exhibit alignment due to volume exclusion interactions, leading to packing configurations. Traditional models of collective dynamics typically impose this alignment phenomenologically, neglecting the influence of volume exclusion on particle positions. In this paper, we derive nematic alignment from an anisotropic repulsive potential, focusing on a Gaussian-type potential and first-order dynamics for the particles. By analyzing larger particle systems and performing a hydrodynamic limit, we uncover the effects of anisotropy on both particle density and direction. Our findings reveal that while particle density evolves independently of direction, anisotropy slows down nonlinear diffusion. The direction dynamics are affected by the particles' position and involve complex transport and diffusion processes, with different behaviors for oblate and prolate particles. The key to obtaining these results lies in recent advancements in Generalized Collision Invariants offered by Degond, Frouvelle and Liu (KRM 2022).</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of ground state solutions by considering the minimization problem on a Nehari-Pohozaev set. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in the proof of the uniqueness of a maximum point of a fibering map. A key ingredient is to establish the energy inequality. We also establish the relation between ground state solutions and $L^2$-constraint minimizers. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature,are responsible for the existence of ground state solutions.</description>

      <title>Turbulent solutions of the binormal flow and the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last three decades there has been an intense activity on the exploration of turbulent phenomena of dispersive equations, as for instance the growth of Sobolev norms since the work of Bourgain in the 90s. In general the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation has been left aside because of its complete integrability. In a series of papers of the last six years that we survey here for the special issue of the ICMP 2024 ([12],[13],[14],[15],[16],[7],[8]), we considered, together with the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation, the binormal flow, which is a geometric flow explicitly related to it. We displayed rigorously a large range of complex behavior as creation of singularities and unique continuation, Fourier growth, Talbot effects, intermittency and multifractality, justifying in particular some previous numerical observations. To do so we constructed a class of well-posedness for the 1D cubic Schr\"odinger equation included in the critical Fourier-Lebesgue space $\mathcal FL^\infty$ and in supercritical Sobolev spaces with respect to scaling. Last but not least we recall that the binormal flow is a classical model for the dynamics of a vortex filament in a 3D fluid or superfluid, and that vortex motions are a key element of turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an inverse boundary value problem in corrosion detection. The model is based on a conductivity equation with nonlinear Robin boundary condition. We prove that the nonlinear Robin term can be identified locally from Cauchy data measurements on a subset of the boundary. A possible strategy for turning a local identification result into a global one is suggested, and a partial result is proved in this direction. The inversion method is an adaptation to this nonlinear Robin problem of a method originally developed for semilinear elliptic equations. The strategy is based on linearization and relies on parametrizing solutions of the nonlinear equation on solutions of the linearized equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel energy method that reinterprets ``curve shortening'' as ``tangent aligning''. This conceptual shift enables the variational study of infinite-length curves evolving by the curve shortening flow, as well as higher order flows such as the elastic flow, which involves not only the curve shortening but also the curve straightening effect. For the curve shortening flow, we prove convergence to a straight line under mild assumptions on the ends of the initial curve. For the elastic flow, we establish a global well-posedness theory, and investigate the precise long-time behavior of solutions. In fact, our method applies to a more general class of geometric evolution equations including the surface diffusion flow, Chen's flow, and the free elastic flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the steady pressure-free Prandtl system. By employing a modified von Mises transformation, we rigorously prove the far-field convergence of Prandtl solutions to Blasius flow. A weighted energy method is employed to establish the optimal convergence rate assuming that the initial data constitutes a perturbation of the Blasius profile. Furthermore, a sharp maximum principle technique is applied to derive the optimal convergence rate for concave initial data. The critical weights and comparison functions depend on the first eigenfunction of the linearized operator associated with the system.</description>

      <title>Global Compactness Result for a Br\'ezis-Nirenberg-Type Problem Involving Mixed Local Nonlocal Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the profile decomposition of Palais-Smale sequences associated with a Brezis-Nirenberg type problem involving a combination of mixed local nonlocal operators, given by
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\Delta u + (-\Delta)^s u - \lambda u = |u|^{2^*-2}u \;\;\mbox{ in } \Omega,
  &amp;\quad u=0\,\mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^N\setminus \Omega.
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{N}$ is a smooth bounded domain with $N \geq 3$, $s\in (0,1),\,\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ is a real parameter and $2^* = \frac{2N}{N - 2} $ denotes the critical Sobolev exponent. As an application of the derived global compactness result, we further study the existence of positive solution of the corresponding Coron-type problem (C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris S\'{e}r I Math, 299(7):209-212, 1984) when $\lambda=0$.</description>

      <title>A Nonlocal Biharmonic Model with $\Gamma$-Convergence to Local Model and an Efficient Numerical Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal models and their associated theories have been extensively investigated in recent years. Among these, nonlocal versions of the classical Laplace operator have attracted the most attention, while higher-order nonlocal operators have been studied far less. In this work, we focus on the nonlocal counterpart of the classical biharmonic operator together with the clamped boundary condition ($u$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}$ are given on the boundary). We develop the variational formulation of a nonlocal biharmonic model, establish the existence and uniqueness of its solution, and analyze its convergence as the nonlocal horizon approaches zero. In addition, we propose an efficient finite element method to solve the nonlocal model and the numerical results verify the analytical properties of the nonlocal model and its solution.</description>

      <title>Boundary Control and Calder\'on type Inverse Problems in Non-local heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine various density results related to the solutions of the non-local heat equation at a specific time slice, focusing on two distinct models: one with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and the other with singular boundary data. In both the cases, we assume the non-local exponent $a\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$. We explore both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the approximations. Additionally, we address Calder\'on-type inverse problems for these parabolic models, where we recover the potentials by analyzing the solutions either on the boundary or at a particular time slice. In both the density results and the Calder\'on type inverse problems, the Pohozaev identity plays a crucial role. Finally, in the last section, we apply the Pohozaev identity to a specific elliptic eigenvalue problem and demonstrate that the eigenfunctions, when divided by an appropriate power of the distance function, can not vanish on any non-empty open subset of the boundary. This particular eigenvalue problem does not need any restriction on the non-local exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in the chiral limit of the Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian, there exist magic angles at which the Hamiltonian exhibits flat bands of multiplicity four instead of two. We analyse the structure of Bloch functions associated with the bands of arbitrary multiplicity, compute the corresponding Chern number to be $ -1 $, and show that there exist infinitely many degenerate magic angles for a generic choice of tunnelling potential, including the Bistritzer--MacDonald potential. Moreover, we demonstrate for generic tunnelling potentials flat bands have only twofold or fourfold multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for Systems of Nonlocal Balance Laws Modeling Dense Multilane Vehicular Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of coupled systems of nonlocal nonlinear balance laws modeling multilane traffic, with the nonlocality present in both convective and source terms. The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution are proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, compared to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 44(6):3354-3392, 2024].The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is indicated. As the support of the kernel tends to zero, the convergence of the entropy solutions of the proposed model to its local counterparts [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 51: 3694-3713, 2019] is also discussed. Numerical simulations illustrating the behavior of the entropy solutions of the coupled nonlocal systems are also shown.</description>

      <title>CB$^2$O: Consensus-Based Bi-Level Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bi-level optimization problems, where one wishes to find the global minimizer of an upper-level objective function over the globally optimal solution set of a lower-level objective, arise in a variety of scenarios throughout science and engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose and investigate, analytically and experimentally, consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), a multi-particle metaheuristic derivative-free optimization method designed to solve bi-level optimization problems when both objectives may be nonconvex. Our method leverages within the computation of the consensus point a carefully designed particle selection principle implemented through a suitable choice of a quantile on the level of the lower-level objective, together with a Laplace principle-type approximation w.r.t. the upper-level objective function, to ensure that the bi-level optimization problem is solved in an intrinsic manner. We give an existence proof of solutions to a corresponding mean-field dynamics, for which we first establish the stability of our consensus point w.r.t. a combination of Wasserstein and $L^2$ perturbations, and consecutively resort to PDE considerations extending the classical Picard iteration to construct a solution. For such solution, we provide a global convergence analysis in mean-field law showing that the solution of the associated nonlinear nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation converges exponentially fast to the unique solution of the bi-level optimization problem provided suitable choices of the hyperparameters. The practicability and efficiency of our CB$^2$O algorithm is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in the settings of constrained global optimization, sparse representation learning, and robust (clustered) federated learning.</description>

      <title>Is Stochastic Gradient Descent Effective? A PDE Perspective on Machine Learning processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the behaviour of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a widely used method in supervised learning for optimizing neural network weights via a minimization of non-convex loss functions. Since the pioneering work of E, Li and Tai (2017), the underlying structure of such processes can be understood via parabolic PDEs of Fokker-Planck type, which are at the core of our analysis. Even if Fokker-Planck equations have a long history and a extensive literature, almost nothing is known when the potential is non-convex or when the diffusion matrix is degenerate, and this is the main difficulty that we face in our analysis.
  We identify two different regimes: in the initial phase of SGD, the loss function drives the weights to concentrate around the nearest local minimum. We refer to this phase as the drift regime and we provide quantitative estimates on this concentration phenomenon. Next, we introduce the diffusion regime, where stochastic fluctuations help the learning process to escape suboptimal local minima. We analyze the Mean Exit Time (MET) and prove upper and lower bounds of the MET. Finally, we address the asymptotic convergence of SGD, for a non-convex cost function and a degenerate diffusion matrix, that do not allow to use the standard approaches, and require new techniques. For this purpose, we exploit two different methods: duality and entropy methods.
  We provide new results about the dynamics and effectiveness of SGD, offering a deep connection between stochastic optimization and PDE theory, and some answers and insights to basic questions in the Machine Learning processes: How long does SGD take to escape from a bad minimum? Do neural network parameters converge using SGD? How do parameters evolve in the first stage of training with SGD?</description>

      <title>On the characterization of the Dirichlet and Fucik spectra of the one-dimensional anisotropic p-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10599v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the Dirichlet spectrum $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on an interval $(0,L)$ where
  \[ \Delta^{a,b}_p u:= \left(a^{p}[(u')^{+}]^{p-1}-b^{p}[(u')^{-}]^{p-1}\right)', \ \ a, b &gt; 0. \] The set $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ and the respective eigenfunctions are completely characterized for $a \neq b$ in terms of the corresponding ones within the isotropic context. As a relevant application, we derive a new optimal Poincar\'e inequality that is stronger than the classical version. The leading ideas are based on glue arguments of conveniently modified eigenfunctions and maximum type principles. More generally, our approach allows to characterize the Fuc\'ik spectrum $\Sigma^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ and mainly the corresponding solutions. All results are novelty even for $p = 2$ which correspond to nonlinear anisotropic operators.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal approach for linear and non-linear wave equations in FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this numerical work, we deal with two distinct problems concerning the propagation of waves in cosmological backgrounds. In both cases, we employ a spacetime foliation given in terms of compactified hyperboloidal slices. These slices intersect future null infinity, so our method is well-suited to study the long-time behaviour of waves. Moreover, our construction is adapted to the presence of the time--dependent scale factor that describes the underlying spacetime expansion. First, we investigate decay rates for solutions to the linear wave equation in a large class of expanding FLRW spacetimes, whose non--compact spatial sections have either zero or negative curvature. By means of a hyperboloidal foliation, we provide new numerical evidence for the sharpness of decay--in--time estimates for linear waves propagating in such spacetimes. Then, in the spatially-flat case, we present numerical results in support of small data global existence of solutions to semi-linear wave equations in FLRW spacetimes having a decelerated expansion, provided that a generalized null condition holds. In absence of this null condition and in the specific case of $ \square_g \phi = (\partial_t \phi)^2 $ (Fritz John's choice), the results we obtain suggest that, when the spacetime expansion is sufficiently slow, solutions diverge in finite time for every choice of initial data.</description>

      <title>Creation of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ Brownian particles, with or without inertia, interacting in the mean-field regime via a weak, smooth, long-range potential, and starting initially from an arbitrary exchangeable $N$-particle distribution. In this model framework, we establish a fine version of the so-called creation-of-chaos phenomenon: in weak norms, the mean-field approximation for a typical particle is shown to hold with an accuracy $O(N^{-1})$ up to an error due solely to initial pair correlations, which is damped exponentially over time. Corresponding higher-order results are also derived in the form of higher-order correlation estimates. The approach is new and easily adaptable: we start from suboptimal correlation estimates obtained from an elementary use of It\^o's calculus on moments of the empirical measure, together with ergodic properties of the mean-field dynamics, and these bounds are then made optimal after combination with PDE estimates on the BBKY hierarchy.</description>
