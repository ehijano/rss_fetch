      <title>An Algebraic Extension of Intuitionistic Linear Logic: The $L_!^S$-Calculus and Its Categorical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $L_!^S$-calculus, a linear lambda-calculus extended with scalar multiplication and term addition, that acts as a proof language for intuitionistic linear logic (ILL). These algebraic operations enable the direct expression of linearity at the syntactic level, a property not typically available in standard proof-term calculi. Building upon previous work, we develop the $L_!^S$-calculus as an extension of the $L^S$-calculus with the $!$ modality. We prove key meta-theoretical properties--subject reduction, confluence, strong normalisation, and an introduction property--as well as preserve the expressiveness of the original $L^S$-calculus, including the encoding of vectors and matrices, and the correspondence between proof-terms and linear functions. A denotational semantics is provided in the framework of linear categories with biproducts, ensuring a sound and adequate interpretation of the calculus. This work is part of a broader programme aiming to build a measurement-free quantum programming language grounded in linear logic.</description>

      <title>Domains, Information Frames, and Their Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{sp25}, continuous information frames were introduced that capture exactly all continuous domains. They are obtained from the information frames considered in \cite{sp21} by omitting the conservativity requirement. Information frames generalise Scott's information systems~\cite{sc82}: Instead of the global consistency predicate, there is now a local consistency predicate for each token. Strong information frames are obtained by strengthening the conditions for these predicates. Let $\CIF$ and $\SIF$ be the corresponding categories.
  In \cite{sxx08} another generalisation of Scott's information systems was introduced which also exactly captures all continuous domains. As shown in \cite{hzl15}, the definition can be simplified while maintaining the representation result. Let $\CIS$ and $\SCIS$ be the corresponding categories. It is shown that all these categories are equivalent. Moreover, the equivalence extends to the subcategories of (strong) continuous information frames with truth elements. Such information frames capture exactly all pointed continuous domains.
  Continuous information frames are families of rudimentary logics, associated with each token is a local consistency predicate and an entailment relation. However, they lack the expressive power of propositional logic. In an attempt to make each of this logics more expressible, continuous stratified conjunctive logics are introduced. These are families of conjunctive logics. The category $\CSL$ of such logics is shown to be isomorphic to $\SIF_{\bt}$, the category of strong continuous information frames with a truth element.</description>

      <title>Branching Bisimulation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a bisimulation learning algorithm for non-deterministic transition systems. We generalise bisimulation learning to systems with bounded branching and extend its applicability to model checking branching-time temporal logic, while previously it was limited to deterministic systems and model checking linear-time properties. Our method computes a finite stutter-insensitive bisimulation quotient of the system under analysis, represented as a decision tree. We adapt the proof rule for well-founded bisimulations to an iterative procedure that trains candidate decision trees from sample transitions of the system, and checks their validity over the entire transition relation using SMT solving. This results in a new technology for model checking CTL* without the next-time operator. Our technique is sound, entirely automated, and yields abstractions that are succinct and effective for formal verification and system diagnostics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on diverse benchmarks comprising concurrent software, communication protocols and robotic scenarios. Our method performs comparably to mature tools in the special case of LTL model checking, and outperforms the state of the art in CTL and CTL* model checking for systems with very large and countably infinite state space.</description>

      <title>The Many-Worlds Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10234v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the interaction between two monoidal structures: a multiplicative one, for the encoding of pairing, and an additive one, for the encoding of choice. We propose a colored PROP to model computation in this framework, where the choice is parameterized by an algebraic side effect: the model can support regular tests, probabilistic and non-deterministic branching, as well as quantum branching, i.e. superposition.
  The graphical language comes equipped with a denotational semantics based on linear applications, and an equational theory. We prove the language to be universal, and the equational theory to be complete with respect to this semantics.</description>

      <title>Variants of Solovay reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outside of the left-c.e. reals, Solovay reducibility is considered to be behaved badly [10.1007/978-0-387-68441-3]. Proposals for variants of Solovay reducibility that are better suited for the investigation of arbitrary, not necessarily left-c.e. reals were made by Rettinger and Zheng [10.1007/978-3-540-27798-9_39], and, recently, by Titov [10.11588/heidok.00034250] and by Kumabe and co-authors [10.4115/jla.2020.12.2; 10.3233/COM-230486]. These variants all coincide with the original version of Solovay reducibility on the left-c.e. reals. Furthermore, they are all defined in terms of translation functions. The latter translate between computable approximations in the case of Rettinger and Zheng, are monotone in the case of Titov, and are functions between reals in the case of Kumabe et al.
  In what follows, we derive new results on the mentioned variants and their relation to each other. In particular, we obtain that Solovay reducibility defined in terms of translation function on rationals implies Solovay reducibility defined in terms of translation functions on reals, and we show that the original version of Solovay reducibility is strictly weaker than its monotone variant.
  Solovay reducibility and its variants mentioned so far have tight connections to Martin-L\"of randomness, the strongest and most central notion of a random sequence. For the investigation of Schnorr randomness, total variants of Solovay reducibility have been introduced by Merkle and Titov [10.48550/arXiv.2407.14869] in 2022 and, independently, by Kumabe et al. [10.3233/COM-230486] in 2024, the latter again via real-valued translation functions. In what follows, we show that total Solovay reducibility defined in terms of rational functions implies total Solovay reducibility defined in terms of real functions.</description>

      <title>Itegories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An itegory is a restriction category with a Kleene wand. Cockett, D\'iaz-Bo\"ils, Gallagher, and Hrube\v{s} briefly introduced Kleene wands to capture iteration in restriction categories arising from complexity theory. The purpose of this paper is to develop in more detail the theory of Kleene wands and itegories.
  A Kleene wand is a binary operator which takes in two disjoint partial maps, an endomorphism ${X \to X}$ and a map ${X \to A}$ and produces a partial map $X \to A$. This latter map is interpreted as iterating the endomorphism until it lands in the domain of definition of the second map. In a setting with infinite disjoint joins, there is always a canonical Kleene wand given by realizing this intuition.
  The standard categorical interpretation of iteration is via trace operators on coproducts. For extensive restriction categories, we explain in detail how having a Kleene wand is equivalent to this standard interpretation of iteration. This suggests that Kleene wands can be used to replace parametrized iteration and traces in restriction categories which lack coproducts. Further evidence of this is exhibited by providing a matrix construction which embeds an itegory into a traced extensive restriction category. We also consider Kleene wands in classical restriction categories and show how, in this case, a Kleene wand is completely determined by its endomorphism component.</description>
