      <title>Magentic-One: A Generalist Multi-Agent System for Solving Complex Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern AI agents, driven by advances in large foundation models, promise to enhance our productivity and transform our lives by augmenting our knowledge and capabilities. To achieve this vision, AI agents must effectively plan, perform multi-step reasoning and actions, respond to novel observations, and recover from errors, to successfully complete complex tasks across a wide range of scenarios. In this work, we introduce Magentic-One, a high-performing open-source agentic system for solving such tasks. Magentic-One uses a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors. Throughout task execution, the Orchestrator directs other specialized agents to perform tasks as needed, such as operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code. We show that Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on three diverse and challenging agentic benchmarks: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. Magentic-One achieves these results without modification to core agent capabilities or to how they collaborate, demonstrating progress towards generalist agentic systems. Moreover, Magentic-One's modular design allows agents to be added or removed from the team without additional prompt tuning or training, easing development and making it extensible to future scenarios. We provide an open-source implementation of Magentic-One, and we include AutoGenBench, a standalone tool for agentic evaluation. AutoGenBench provides built-in controls for repetition and isolation to run agentic benchmarks in a rigorous and contained manner -- which is important when agents' actions have side-effects. Magentic-One, AutoGenBench and detailed empirical performance evaluations of Magentic-One, including ablations and error analysis are available at https://aka.ms/magentic-one</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Resource Management for C-V2X Platooning via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a semantic-aware multi-modal resource allocation (SAMRA) for multi-task using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), termed SAMRAMARL, utilizing in platoon systems where cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication is employed. The proposed approach leverages the semantic information to optimize the allocation of communication resources. By integrating a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, SAMRAMARL enables autonomous decision-making for each vehicle, channel assignment optimization, power allocation, and semantic symbol length based on the contextual importance of the transmitted information. This semantic-awareness ensures that both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications prioritize data that is critical for maintaining safe and efficient platoon operations. The framework also introduces a tailored quality of experience (QoE) metric for semantic communication, aiming to maximize QoE in V2V links while improving the success rate of semantic information transmission (SRS). Extensive simulations has demonstrated that SAMRAMARL outperforms existing methods, achieving significant gains in QoE and communication efficiency in C-V2X platooning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Socially-Aware Opinion-Based Navigation with Oval Limit Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When humans move in a shared space, they choose navigation strategies that preserve their mutual safety. At the same time, each human seeks to minimise the number of modifications to her/his path. In order to achieve this result, humans use unwritten rules and reach a consensus on their decisions about the motion direction by exchanging non-verbal messages. They then implement their choice in a mutually acceptable way. Socially-aware navigation denotes a research effort aimed at replicating this logic inside robots. Existing results focus either on how robots can participate in negotiations with humans, or on how they can move in a socially acceptable way. We propose a holistic approach in which the two aspects are jointly considered. Specifically, we show that by combining opinion dynamics (to reach a consensus) with vortex fields (to generate socially acceptable trajectories), the result outperforms the application of the two techniques in isolation.</description>

      <title>CaPo: Cooperative Plan Optimization for Efficient Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the cooperation problem among large language model (LLM) based embodied agents, where agents must cooperate to achieve a common goal. Previous methods often execute actions extemporaneously and incoherently, without long-term strategic and cooperative planning, leading to redundant steps, failures, and even serious repercussions in complex tasks like search-and-rescue missions where discussion and cooperative plan are crucial. To solve this issue, we propose Cooperative Plan Optimization (CaPo) to enhance the cooperation efficiency of LLM-based embodied agents. Inspired by human cooperation schemes, CaPo improves cooperation efficiency with two phases: 1) meta-plan generation, and 2) progress-adaptive meta-plan and execution. In the first phase, all agents analyze the task, discuss, and cooperatively create a meta-plan that decomposes the task into subtasks with detailed steps, ensuring a long-term strategic and coherent plan for efficient coordination. In the second phase, agents execute tasks according to the meta-plan and dynamically adjust it based on their latest progress (e.g., discovering a target object) through multi-turn discussions. This progress-based adaptation eliminates redundant actions, improving the overall cooperation efficiency of agents. Experimental results on the ThreeDworld Multi-Agent Transport and Communicative Watch-And-Help tasks demonstrate that CaPo achieves much higher task completion rate and efficiency compared with state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>StoryAgent: Customized Storytelling Video Generation via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has spurred research into automated video generation to streamline conventional processes. However, automating storytelling video production, particularly for customized narratives, remains challenging due to the complexity of maintaining subject consistency across shots. While existing approaches like Mora and AesopAgent integrate multiple agents for Story-to-Video (S2V) generation, they fall short in preserving protagonist consistency and supporting Customized Storytelling Video Generation (CSVG). To address these limitations, we propose StoryAgent, a multi-agent framework designed for CSVG. StoryAgent decomposes CSVG into distinct subtasks assigned to specialized agents, mirroring the professional production process. Notably, our framework includes agents for story design, storyboard generation, video creation, agent coordination, and result evaluation. Leveraging the strengths of different models, StoryAgent enhances control over the generation process, significantly improving character consistency. Specifically, we introduce a customized Image-to-Video (I2V) method, LoRA-BE, to enhance intra-shot temporal consistency, while a novel storyboard generation pipeline is proposed to maintain subject consistency across shots. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in synthesizing highly consistent storytelling videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include the introduction of StoryAgent, a versatile framework for video generation tasks, and novel techniques for preserving protagonist consistency.</description>

      <title>Proportional Fairness in Obnoxious Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the obnoxious facility location problem (in which agents prefer the facility location to be far from them) and propose a hierarchy of distance-based proportional fairness concepts for the problem. These fairness axioms ensure that groups of agents at the same location are guaranteed to be a distance from the facility proportional to their group size. We consider deterministic and randomized mechanisms, and compute tight bounds on the price of proportional fairness. In the deterministic setting, we show that our proportional fairness axioms are incompatible with strategyproofness, and prove asymptotically tight $\epsilon$-price of anarchy and stability bounds for proportionally fair welfare-optimal mechanisms. In the randomized setting, we identify proportionally fair and strategyproof mechanisms that give an expected welfare within a constant factor of the optimal welfare. Finally, we prove existence results for two extensions to our model.</description>

      <title>Learning to Communicate and Collaborate in a Competitive Multi-Agent Setup to Clean the Ocean from Macroplastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding a balance between collaboration and competition is crucial for artificial agents in many real-world applications. We investigate this using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) setup on the back of a high-impact problem. The accumulation and yearly growth of plastic in the ocean cause irreparable damage to many aspects of oceanic health and the marina system. To prevent further damage, we need to find ways to reduce macroplastics from known plastic patches in the ocean. Here we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based communication mechanism that increases the agents' observation space. In our custom environment, agents control a plastic collecting vessel. The communication mechanism enables agents to develop a communication protocol using a binary signal. While the goal of the agent collective is to clean up as much as possible, agents are rewarded for the individual amount of macroplastics collected. Hence agents have to learn to communicate effectively while maintaining high individual performance. We compare our proposed communication mechanism with a multi-agent baseline without the ability to communicate. Results show communication enables collaboration and increases collective performance significantly. This means agents have learned the importance of communication and found a balance between collaboration and competition.</description>

      <title>Instruct, Not Assist: LLM-based Multi-Turn Planning and Hierarchical Questioning for Socratic Code Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Socratic questioning is an effective teaching strategy, encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving. The conversational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential for providing scalable, real-time student guidance. However, current LLMs often give away solutions directly, making them ineffective instructors. We tackle this issue in the code debugging domain with TreeInstruct, an Instructor agent guided by a novel state space-based planning algorithm. TreeInstruct asks probing questions to help students independently identify and resolve errors. It estimates a student's conceptual and syntactical knowledge to dynamically construct a question tree based on their responses and current knowledge state, effectively addressing both independent and dependent mistakes concurrently in a multi-turn interaction setting. In addition to using an existing single-bug debugging benchmark, we construct a more challenging multi-bug dataset of 150 coding problems, incorrect solutions, and bug fixes -- all carefully constructed and annotated by experts. Extensive evaluation shows TreeInstruct's state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, proving it to be a more effective instructor than baselines. Furthermore, a real-world case study with five students of varying skill levels further demonstrates TreeInstruct's ability to guide students to debug their code efficiently with minimal turns and highly Socratic questioning.</description>

      <title>EFX Exists for Three Types of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of finding an envy-free allocation of indivisible goods among multiple agents. EFX, which stands for envy-freeness up to any good, is a well-studied relaxation of the envy-free allocation problem and has been shown to exist for specific scenarios. For instance, EFX is known to exist when there are only three agents [Chaudhury et al, EC 2020], and for any number of agents when there are only two types of valuations [Mahara, Discret. Appl. Math 2023].
  We show that EFX allocations exist for any number of agents when there are at most three types of additive valuations.</description>

      <title>GraphTeam: Facilitating Large Language Model-based Graph Analysis via Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy. The code and data are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/GraphTeam.</description>

      <title>Online Relational Inference for Evolving Multi-agent Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework, Online Relational Inference (ORI), designed to efficiently identify hidden interaction graphs in evolving multi-agent interacting systems using streaming data. Unlike traditional offline methods that rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating the model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing environments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix as a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate technique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity of the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data augmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve generalization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap for human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing methods. This approach is model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with various neural relational inference (NRI) architectures, and offers a robust solution for real-time applications in complex, evolving systems.</description>
