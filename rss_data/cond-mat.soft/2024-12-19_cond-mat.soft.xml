      <title>Tunable mechanical properties and air-based lubrication in an acoustically levitated granular material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cohesive granular materials are found in many natural and industrial environments, but experimental platforms for exploring the innate mechanical properties of these materials are often limited by the difficulty of adjusting cohesion strength. Granular particles levitated in an acoustic cavity form a model system to address this. Such particles self-assemble into free-floating, quasi-two-dimensional raft structures which are held together by acoustic scattering forces; the strength of this attraction can be changed simply by modifying the sound field. We investigate the mechanical properties of acoustically bound granular rafts using substrate-free micro-scale shear tests. We first demonstrate deformation of rafts of spheres and the dependence of this deformation on acoustic pressure. We then apply these methods to rafts composed of anisotropic sand grains and smaller spheres, in which the smaller spheres have a thin layer of air separating them from other grain surfaces. These spheres act as soft, effectively frictionless particles that populate the interstices between the larger grains, which enables us to investigate the effect of lubricating the mixture in the presence of large-grain cohesion.</description>

      <title>Scaling field-theoretic simulation for multi-component mixtures with neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-component polymer mixtures are ubiquitous in biological self-organization but are notoriously difficult to study computationally. Plagued by both slow single molecule relaxation times and slow equilibration within dense mixtures, molecular dynamics simulations are typically infeasible at the spatial scales required to study the stability of mesophase structure. Polymer field theories offer an attractive alternative, but analytical calculations are only tractable for mean-field theories and nearby perturbations, constraints that become especially problematic for fluctuation-induced effects such as coacervation. Here, we show that a recently developed technique for obtaining numerical solutions to partial differential equations based on operator learning, *neural operators*, lends itself to a highly scalable training strategy by parallelizing per-species operator maps. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach on six-component mixtures with randomly selected compositions and that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art pseudospectral integrators for field-theoretic simulations, especially as polymer lengths become long.</description>

      <title>Length-dependent residence time of contacts in simple polymeric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the reported experimental evidence that the residence time of contacts between the ends of biopolymers is length dependent, we investigate the kinetics of contact breaking in simple polymer models from a theoretical point of view. We solved Kramers equation first for an ideal chain and then for a polymer with attracting ends, and compared the predictions with the results of molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the mean residence time always shows a power--law dependence on the length of the polymer with exponent $-1$, although is significantly smaller when obtained from the analysis of a single trajectory than when calculated from independent initial conformations. Only when the interaction is strong (&gt;&gt;kT) and the interaction range is small (of the order of the distance between consecutive monomers) does the residence time converge to that of the Arrhenius equation, independent of the length. We are able to provide expressions of the mean residence time for cases when the exact definition of contact is not available a priori, expressions that can be useful in typical cases of microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of sharp solute-solvent interfaces in hydrophobic environments via cylindrical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes sharp solute-solvent interfaces in hydrophobic environments, and there are three major ingredients. The first is the variational implicit solvent model (VISM) which establishes the free energy functional of arbitrary solvation states. The minimization of this functional yields a PDE which characterizes both the stable and saddle solute-solvent interfaces. The second is a solute system consisting of two Gay-Berne ellipsoidal hydrophobic molecules. The cylindrical coordinates reduce the corresponding PDE to an ODE which is more traceable, increasing the computability of the solute-solvent interfaces under solvation effects. The third, which is the innovative part of this paper, transforms the computation of sharp solute-solvent interfaces into an ODE boundary value problem. We introduce an effective method for numerically computing saddle interfaces. This remains a hard problem in previous research. Besides, we address some qualitative results and study how the interface varies with respect to the distance between the two Gay-Berne ellipsoidal hydrophobic molecules.</description>

      <title>The influence of higher order geometric terms on the asymmetry and dynamics of membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider membranes as fluid deformable surface and allow for higher order geometric terms in the bending energy. The evolution equations are derived and numerically solved using surface finite elements. The higher order geometric terms related to the Gaussian curvature squared have a tendency to stabilize tubes and enhance the evolution towards equilibrium shapes, thereby facilitating rapid shape changes. This is demonstrated in axisymmetric settings and fully three-dimensional simulations.</description>

      <title>Recursive Algorithm to the Centroid of Free Area for Inherent Structure and Hopping Motion in Deeply Supercooled Binary Hard Disk Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inherent structures, derived by eliminating thermal fluctuations from complex trajectories, illuminate fundamental mechanisms underlying structural relaxation and dynamic heterogeneity in dense glassy systems. However, determining these structures in hard disk/sphere systems presents unique challenges due to the discontinuous nature of inter-particle potentials and resultant flat potential energy landscapes. To address this limitation, we introduce the Recursive Centroid of Free Area algorithm (ReCFA), a novel approach inspired by a steepest descent method, which computes inherent structure configurations in hard disk systems. We conducted comparative analyses between ReCFA, similar methods, and a conventional time-coarse-graining technique, focusing on string-like hopping motions in supercompressed binary hard disks that emulate supercooled liquid behavior. ReCFA demonstrated notable advantages in capturing entropic contributions. The configurations derived through ReCFA exhibited physically reasonable particle displacements analogous to inherent structures in soft particle systems, effectively identifying hopping motions between metastable basins in jammed states. This ReCFA-based analysis enhances our understanding of relaxation dynamics in highly compressed glassy systems, offering a robust analytical tool for investigating both dynamic and structural characteristics across hard and soft particle systems.</description>

      <title>Role of viscoelasticity in the adhesion of mushroom-shaped pillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mushroom-shaped pillars have been extensively studied for their superior adhesive properties, often drawing inspiration from natural attachment systems observed in insects. Typically, pillars are modeled with linear elastic materials in the literature; in reality, the soft materials used for their fabrication exhibit a rate-dependent constitutive behavior.
  This study investigates the role of viscoelasticity in the adhesion between a mushroom-shaped pillar and a rigid flat countersurface. Interactions at the interface are assumed to be governed by van der Waals forces, and the material is modeled using a standard linear solid model. Normal push and release contact cycles are simulated at different approaching and retracting speeds.
  Results reveal that, in the presence of an interfacial defect, a monotonically increasing trend in the pull-off force with pulling speed is observed, and the corresponding change in the contact pressure distribution suggests a transition from short-range to long-range adhesion. This phenomenon corroborates recent experimental and theoretical investigations. Moreover, the pull-off force remains invariant to the loading history, due to our assumption of a flat-flat contact interface. Conversely, in absence of defects, detachment occurs after reaching the theoretical contact strength, and the corresponding pull-off force is found to be rate independent.</description>

      <title>The Soft-Membrane Surface Forces Apparatus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compliant walls are widespread in biological and engineering systems. Because of their singular nature, adapted tools are required to accurately study their rheological properties as well as the consequences of the latter within a given mechanical setting. Because of their slender nature, membranes can be considered as prototypical examples of highly compliant boundaries. In this study, we describe a modified Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) developed to measure the forces acting on a compliant membrane by measuring its deformation field. We discuss how such a device can be used to characterize the rheology of suspended membranes and accurately measure the electrostatic interactions between a polarized membrane and a spherical electrode, without the need of an external measurement spring.</description>

      <title>Ion Sieving in Two-Dimensional Membranes from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first-principles approach for calculating ion separation in solution through two-dimensional (2D) membranes is proposed and applied. Ionic energy profiles across the membrane are obtained first, where solvation effects are simulated explicitly with machine-learning molecular dynamics, electrostatic corrections are applied to remove finite-size capacitive effects, and a mean-field treatment of the charging of the electrochemical double layer is used. Entropic contributions are assessed analytically and validated against thermodynamic integration. Ionic separations are then inferred through a microkinetic model of the filtration process, accounting for steady-state charge separation effects across the membrane. The approach is applied to Li$^{+}$, Na$^{+}$, K$^{+}$ sieving through a crown-ether functionalized graphene membrane, with a case study of the mechanisms for a highly selective and efficient extraction of lithium from aqueous solutions.</description>

      <title>The effect of ion solvation on ion-induced nucleation -- a generalized Thomson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for ion-induced nucleation, focusing on the effect of dissociated ions embedded in the fluid surrounding a charged core or colloid. The model includes the ions' direct electrostatic energy and preferential solvation. The integrated ions' free energy has two terms: The first can be short- or long-range, depending on their density. The second is proportional to the nucleus' volume and can shift the state from undersaturation to supersaturation at high ion concentration. The inclusion of the Gibbs transfer energies of ions in the free energy leads to a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the potential around the core. The integrated ions' free energy is added to the fluids' interfacial and bulk terms to establish a generalized Thomson model. In the Debye-Huckel limit, the model is solved analytically, while in the nonlinear regime, it is solved numerically. The state diagram in the plane of saturation and core charge includes regions with a homogeneous phase, electro-prewetting, metastable vapor, metastable nucleus, and spontaneous nucleation states. The lines separating these regions depend sensitively on the preferential solvation. Our model shows nucleation asymmetry to the sign of the nucleus' charge. This sign asymmetry is due to the Gibbs transfer energies of ions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</description>

      <title>Measuring collective diffusion properties by counting particles in boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective diffusion, characterised by the collective diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{coll}$, is a key quantity for describing the macroscopic transport properties of soft matter systems. However, measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a fundamental experimental and numerical challenge, as it either relies on nonequilibrium techniques that are hard to interpret or on Fourier-based approaches at equilibrium which are fraught with difficulties associated with Fourier transforms. In this work, we present a novel approach to measure collective diffusion properties by analysing the statistics of particle number counts $N(t)$ in virtual observation boxes of an image at equilibrium, a method we term the "Countoscope". By investigating the equilibrium diffusive dynamics of a 2D colloidal suspension experimentally and numerically, we demonstrate this method can accurately measure $D_\mathrm{coll}$. We validate our results against Fourier-based approaches and establish best practices for measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ using fluctuating counts. Remarkably, Fourier techniques struggle with long-range collective measurements because of the non-periodic nature of an experimental image, yet counting fully exploits this property by deliberately using finite observation windows. Finally, we discuss the potential of our method to advance our understanding of collective properties in suspensions, particularly the role of hydrodynamic interactions.</description>

      <title>Cooperative polymer dynamics at the crossover between the unentangled and the entangled regimes: theoretical predictions of scattering and linear shear relaxation for polyethylene melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of polymer melts at the crossover between unentagled and entangled regimes is formalized here through an extension of the Cooperative Dynamics Generalized Langevin Equation (CDGLE) (\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} 110,7574 (1999)), by including the constraint to the dynamics due to entanglements through an effective inter-monomer potential that confines the motion of the chains. As one polymer chain in a melt interpenetrates with a $\sqrt{N}$ other chains, with $N$ the degree of chain polymerization, their dynamics is coupled through their potential of mean-force, leading to chains' cooperative motion and center-of-mass subdiffusive dynamics. When increasing the degree of polymerization, the extended CDGLE approach describes the dynamical behavior of unentangled to weakly entangled systems undergoing cooperative dynamics. By direct comparison of the CDGLE with data of Neutron Spin Echo (NSE) experiments on polyethylene melts we find that the cooperative dynamics in entangled systems are confined in the region delimited by entanglements. We extend the CDGLE to describe linear dynamical mechanical measurements and use it to calculate shear relaxation for the polyethylene samples investigated by NSE. The effects of cooperative dynamics, local flexibility, and entanglements in the shear relaxation are discussed. It is noteworthy that the theoretical approach describes with accuracy the crossover from unentangled to entangled-global dynamics for polyethylene melts of increasing chain length, covering the regimes of unentangled and weakly entangled (up to $13$ entanglements) dynamics in one approach.</description>

      <title>Kinetic view on dynamic plasticity of crystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microstructural changes in solids, driven by energy flows, do not develop in a static continuous space, such as the space considered in conventional plasticity models. The applied forces create an evolving internal energy landscape, which is constrained by crystallography but has characteristic spatial and temporal scales that form dynamically. To describe this view, we replace a common model for the evolution of dislocation substructure in metals with the evolution of microscopic slips in a combinatorial structure referred to as a polytopal cell complex (PCC). The micro-slips are associated with the 2-cells (faces) of the PCC and are driven by the minimisation of a properly defined Lagrangian. The approach provides a comprehensive statistical and thermodynamic description of plastic flow development. It allows the investigation of energy levels associated with different slip systems and reveals the microscopic mechanisms that result in the phenomenon of strain rate sensitivity.</description>

As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Accessing Semi-Addressable Self Assembly with Efficient Structure Enumeration</title>

Abstract: Modern experimental methods enable the creation of self-assembly building blocks with tunable interactions, but optimally exploiting this tunability for the self-assembly of desired structures remains an important challenge. Many studies of this inverse problem start with the so-called fully-addressable limit, where every particle in a target structure is different. This leads to clear design principles that often result in high assembly yield, but it is not a scaleable approach -- at some point, one must grapple with "reusing" building blocks, which lowers the degree of addressability and may cause a multitude of off-target structures to form, complicating the design process. Here, we solve a key obstacle preventing robust inverse design in the "semi-addressable regime" by developing a highly efficient algorithm that enumerates all structures that can be formed from a given set of building blocks. By combining this with established partition-function-based yield calculations, we show that it is almost always possible to find economical semi-addressable designs where the entropic gain from reusing building blocks outweighs the presence of off-target structures and even increases the yield of the target. Thus, not only does our enumeration algorithm enable robust and scalable inverse design in the semi-addressable regime, our results demonstrate that it is possible to operate in this regime while maintaining the level of control often associated with full addressability.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of elliptical JKR-type adhesive contact</title>

Abstract: The classic Johnson Kendall Roberts (JKR) theory describes the short-ranged adhesive contact of elastic bodies, but is only valid for axisymmetric contact. A theory for non-axisymmetric contact, which relies on approximating the contact region as an ellipse, was proposed by Johnson and Greenwood (JG). The theory includes the effects of adhesion via Griffith's criterion applied only at the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the contact ellipse. Although JG's work is in good agreement with numerical and experimental results for quasi-circular contacts, the agreement worsens as the eccentricity of the contact region increases. In this paper, we show that including the effects of adhesion by instead minimizing the sum of elastic and surface energy yields results that are in excellent agreement with previous numerical simulations over the full range of contact eccentricities.</description>

      <title>Theory of polymers in binary solvent solutions: mean-field free energy and phase behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a lattice model for polymer solutions, explicitly incorporating interactions with a bath of solvent and cosolvent molecules. By exploiting the well-known analogy between polymer systems and the $O(n)$-vector spin model in the limit $n \to 0$, we derive an exact field-theoretic expression for the partition function of the system. The latter is then evaluated at the saddle point, providing a mean-field estimate of the free energy. The resulting expression, which conforms to the Flory-Huggins type, is then used to analyze the system's stability with respect to phase separation, complemented by a numerical approach based on convex hull evaluation. We demonstrate that this simple lattice model can effectively explain the behavior of a variety of seemingly unrelated polymer systems, which have been predominantly investigated in the past only through numerical simulations. This includes both, single-chain and multi-chain, solutions. Our findings emphasize the fundamental, mutually competing, roles of solvent and cosolvent in polymer systems.</description>

      <title>Driving forces in cell migration and pattern formation in a soft tissue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a description of cell diffusion in a soft tissue, paying special attention to the coupling of force, matter, and microforce balance laws through a suitable dissipation principle. To this end, we cast our framework into a multi-level schematics, comprising both kinematics and kinetics, based on a characterization of the free energy. We lay down first a force balance law, where force and stress fields are defined as power conjugate quantities to velocity fields and their gradients, then we give a species molar balance law, with chemical potential test fields, as power conjugate quantities to the rate of change of the species concentration, and finally a microforce balance law. The main feature of this framework is the constitutive expression for the chemical potential which is split into a term derived from the homogeneous convex part of the free energy and an active external chemical potential giving rise to the spinodal decomposition. The active part of the chemical potential is given an expression depending on the cell concentration and resembling the one defined in [Oster, Murray and Harris, J. Embryol. Exp. Morph. 78 (1983)], where it is meant to characterize an upward cell diffusion induced by cell motility. Further we show how an external vector field, entering the microforce balance law as a power conjugate quantity to the rate of change of the concentration gradient, can guide the diffusion process to a different limit stationary pattern. This vector field could possibly model any directional cue or bias characterizing the interaction of the migrating cells and the surrounding tissue.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Worthington jets \&amp; droplets produced by bursting bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</description>
