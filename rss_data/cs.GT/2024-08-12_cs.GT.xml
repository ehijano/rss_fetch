      <title>Effects of Vote Delegation in Blockchains: Who Wins?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates which alternative benefits from vote delegation in binary collective decisions within blockchains. We begin by examining two extreme cases of voting weight distributions: Equal-Weight (EW), where each voter has equal voting weight, and Dominant-Weight (DW), where a single voter holds a majority of the voting weights before any delegation occurs. We show that vote delegation tends to benefit the ex-ante minority under EW, i.e., the alternative with a lower initial probability of winning. The converse holds under DW distribution. Through numerical simulations, we extend our findings to arbitrary voting weight distributions, showing that vote delegation benefits the ex-ante majority when it leads to a more balanced distribution of voting weights. Finally, in large communities where all agents have equal voting weight, vote delegation has a negligible impact on the outcome. These insights provide practical guidance for governance decisions in blockchains.</description>

      <title>A Generalised $\lambda$-Core Concept for Normal Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we develop a generalisation of the $\lambda$-Core solution for non-cooperative games in normal form. We show that this generalised $\lambda$-Core is non-empty for the class of separable games that admit a socially optimal Nash equilibrium. Examples are provided that indicate that non-emptiness of the generalised $\lambda$-Core cannot be expected for large classes of normal form games.</description>

      <title>Learning in Time-Varying Monotone Network Games with Dynamic Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for multi-agent learning in a nonstationary dynamic network environment. More specifically, we examine projected gradient play in smooth monotone repeated network games in which the agents' participation and connectivity vary over time. We model this changing system with a stochastic network which takes a new independent realization at each repetition. We show that the strategy profile learned by the agents through projected gradient dynamics over the sequence of network realizations converges to a Nash equilibrium of the game in which players minimize their expected cost, almost surely and in the mean-square sense. We then show that the learned strategy profile is an almost Nash equilibrium of the game played by the agents at each stage of the repeated game with high probability. Using these two results, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on the regret incurred by the agents.</description>

      <title>Large Model Strategic Thinking, Small Model Efficiency: Transferring Theory of Mind in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the performance of larger, newer Large Language Models continues to improve for strategic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, the demand for these state of the art models increases commensurately. However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, simulation-ready agents by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine a social context with a social dilemma, recording its answers, and using them for Q\&amp;A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model exhibited significant performance closer to that of its larger relative, and that their improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a \%46 improvement in aligning with the behavior of the larger model, with \%100 representing complete alignment. This suggests that our pipeline represents an efficient method to transmit some form of theory of mind to smaller models, creating improved and cheaply deployable algorithms in the process. Despite their simplicity and their associated shortcomings and limitations, our findings represent a stepping stone in the pursuit and training of specialized models for strategic and social decision making.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary mechanisms that promote cooperation may not promote social welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of prosocial behaviours among self-interested individuals is an important problem in many scientific disciplines. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the evolution of such behaviours, primarily seeking the conditions under which a given mechanism can induce highest levels of cooperation. As these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is however possible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare -- the later broadly defined as the total population payoff, taking into account all costs involved for inducing increased prosocial behaviours. Herein, by comparatively analysing the social welfare and cooperation levels obtained from stochastic evolutionary models of two well-established mechanisms of prosocial behaviour, namely, peer and institutional incentives, we demonstrate exactly that. We show that the objectives of maximising cooperation levels and the objectives of maximising social welfare are often misaligned. We argue for the need of adopting social welfare as the main optimisation objective when designing and implementing evolutionary mechanisms for social and collective goods.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of state-based potential games for process optimization in decentralized manufacturing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel transfer learning approach in state-based potential games (TL-SbPGs) for enhancing distributed self-optimization in manufacturing systems. The approach focuses on the practical relevant industrial setting where sharing and transferring gained knowledge among similar-behaved players improves the self-learning mechanism in large-scale systems. With TL-SbPGs, the gained knowledge can be reused by other players to optimize their policies, thereby improving the learning outcomes of the players and accelerating the learning process. To accomplish this goal, we develop transfer learning concepts and similarity criteria for players, which offer two distinct settings: (a) predefined similarities between players and (b) dynamically inferred similarities between players during training. We formally prove the applicability of the SbPG framework in transfer learning. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method to determine the optimal timing and weighting of the transfer learning procedure during the training phase. Through experiments on a laboratory-scale testbed, we demonstrate that TL-SbPGs significantly boost production efficiency while reducing power consumption of the production schedules while also outperforming native SbPGs.</description>

      <title>Hi-SAM: A high-scalable authentication model for satellite-ground Zero-Trust system using mean field game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As more and more Internet of Thing (IoT) devices are connected to satellite networks, the Zero-Trust Architecture brings dynamic security to the satellite-ground system, while frequent authentication creates challenges for system availability. To make the system's accommodate more IoT devices, this paper proposes a high-scalable authentication model (Hi-SAM). Hi-SAM introduces the Proof-of-Work idea to authentication, which allows device to obtain the network resource based on frequency. To optimize the frequency, mean field game is used for competition among devices, which can reduce the decision space of large-scale population games. And a dynamic time-range message authentication code is designed for security. From the test at large population scales, Hi-SAM is superior in the optimization of authentication workload and the anomaly detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mixed Fair Division: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fair division considers the allocation of scarce resources among agents in such a way that every agent gets a fair share. It is a fundamental problem in society and has received significant attention and rapid developments from the game theory and artificial intelligence communities in recent years. The majority of the fair division literature can be divided along at least two orthogonal directions: goods versus chores, and divisible versus indivisible resources. In this survey, besides describing the state of the art, we outline a number of interesting open questions and future directions in three mixed fair division settings: (i) indivisible goods and chores, (ii) divisible and indivisible goods (mixed goods), and (iii) indivisible goods with subsidy which can be viewed like a divisible good.</description>

      <title>Computing Balanced Solutions for Large International Kidney Exchange Schemes When Cycle Length Is Unbounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In kidney exchange programmes (KEP) patients may swap their incompatible donors leading to cycles of kidney transplants. Nowadays, countries try to merge their national patient-donor pools leading to international KEPs (IKEPs). As shown in the literature, long-term stability of an IKEP can be achieved through a credit-based system. In each round, every country is prescribed a "fair" initial allocation of kidney transplants. The initial allocation, which we obtain by using solution concepts from cooperative game theory, is adjusted by incorporating credits from the previous round, yielding the target allocation. The goal is to find, in each round, an optimal solution that closely approximates this target allocation. There is a known polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal solution that lexicographically minimizes the country deviations from the target allocation if only $2$-cycles (matchings) are permitted. In practice, kidney swaps along longer cycles may be performed. However, the problem of computing optimal solutions for maximum cycle length $\ell$ is NP-hard for every $\ell\geq 3$. This situation changes back to polynomial time once we allow unbounded cycle length. However, in contrast to the case where $\ell=2$, we show that for $\ell=\infty$, lexicographical minimization is only polynomial-time solvable under additional conditions (assuming P $\neq$ NP). Nevertheless, the fact that the optimal solutions themselves can be computed in polynomial time if $\ell=\infty$ still enables us to perform a large scale experimental study for showing how stability and total social welfare are affected when we set $\ell=\infty$ instead of $\ell=2$.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium in Games on Graphs with Incomplete Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Games with incomplete preferences are an important model for studying rational decision-making in scenarios where players face incomplete information about their preferences and must contend with incomparable outcomes. We study the problem of computing Nash equilibrium in a subclass of two-player games played on graphs where each player seeks to maximally satisfy their (possibly incomplete) preferences over a set of temporal goals. We characterize the Nash equilibrium and prove its existence in scenarios where player preferences are fully aligned, partially aligned, and completely opposite, in terms of the well-known solution concepts of sure winning and Pareto efficiency. When preferences are partially aligned, we derive conditions under which a player needs cooperation and demonstrate that the Nash equilibria depend not only on the preference alignment but also on whether the players need cooperation to achieve a better outcome and whether they are willing to cooperate.We illustrate the theoretical results by solving a mechanism design problem for a drone delivery scenario.</description>
