      <title>HemePLM-Diffuse: A Scalable Generative Framework for Protein-Ligand Dynamics in Large Biomolecular System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehending the long-timescale dynamics of protein-ligand complexes is very important for drug discovery and structural biology, but it continues to be computationally challenging for large biomolecular systems. We introduce HemePLM-Diffuse, an innovative generative transformer model that is designed for accurate simulation of protein-ligand trajectories, inpaints the missing ligand fragments, and sample transition paths in systems with more than 10,000 atoms. HemePLM-Diffuse has features of SE(3)-Invariant tokenization approach for proteins and ligands, that utilizes time-aware cross-attentional diffusion to effectively capture atomic motion. We also demonstrate its capabilities using the 3CQV HEME system, showing enhanced accuracy and scalability compared to leading models such as TorchMD-Net, MDGEN, and Uni-Mol.</description>

      <title>Boltzina: Efficient and Accurate Virtual Screening via Docking-Guided Binding Prediction with Boltz-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In structure-based drug discovery, virtual screening using conventional molecular docking methods can be performed rapidly but suffers from limitations in prediction accuracy. Recently, Boltz-2 was proposed, achieving extremely high accuracy in binding affinity prediction, but requiring approximately 20 seconds per compound per GPU, making it difficult to apply to large-scale screening of hundreds of thousands to millions of compounds. This study proposes Boltzina, a novel framework that leverages Boltz-2's high accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency. Boltzina achieves both accuracy and speed by omitting the rate-limiting structure prediction from Boltz-2's architecture and directly predicting affinity from AutoDock Vina docking poses. We evaluate on eight assays from the MF-PCBA dataset and show that while Boltzina performs below Boltz-2, it provides significantly higher screening performance compared to AutoDock Vina and GNINA. Additionally, Boltzina achieved up to 11.8$\times$ faster through reduced recycling iterations and batch processing. Furthermore, we investigated multi-pose selection strategies and two-stage screening combining Boltzina and Boltz-2, presenting optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency according to application requirements. This study represents the first attempt to apply Boltz-2's high-accuracy predictions to practical-scale screening, offering a pipeline that combines both accuracy and efficiency in computational biology. The Boltzina is available on github; https://github.com/ohuelab/boltzina.</description>

      <title>Flexibility-Conditioned Protein Structure Design with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in geometric deep learning and generative modeling have enabled the design of novel proteins with a wide range of desired properties. However, current state-of-the-art approaches are typically restricted to generating proteins with only static target properties, such as motifs and symmetries. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by proposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which is crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition. We first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting per-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip, we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that solves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target flexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate novel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and BackFlip are available at https://github.com/graeter-group/flips .</description>

      <title>Multi-domain Distribution Learning for De Novo Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DrugFlow, a generative model for structure-based drug design that integrates continuous flow matching with discrete Markov bridges, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in learning chemical, geometric, and physical aspects of three-dimensional protein-ligand data. We endow DrugFlow with an uncertainty estimate that is able to detect out-of-distribution samples. To further enhance the sampling process towards distribution regions with desirable metric values, we propose a joint preference alignment scheme applicable to both flow matching and Markov bridge frameworks. Furthermore, we extend our model to also explore the conformational landscape of the protein by jointly sampling side chain angles and molecules.</description>

      <title>One pocket to activate them all: Efforts on understanding the modulator pocket in K2P channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modulator pocket is a cryptic site discovered in the TREK1 K2P channel that accommodates agonists capable of increasing the channel's activity. Since its discovery, equivalent sites in other K2P channels have been shown to bind various ligands, both endogenous and exogenous. In this review, we attempt to elucidate how the modulator pocket contributes to K2P channel activation. To this end, we first describe the gating mechanisms reported in the literature and rationalize their modes of action. We then highlight previous experimental and computational evidence for agonists that bind to the modulator pocket, together with mutations at this site that affect gating. Finally, we elaborate how the activation signal arising from the modulator pocket is transduced to the gates in K2P channels. In doing so, we outline a potential common modulator pocket architecture across K2P channels: a largely amphipathic structure -consistent with the expected properties of a pocket exposed at the interface between a hydrophobic membrane and the aqueous solvent- but still with some important channel-sequence-variations. This architecture and its key differences can be leveraged for the design of new selective and potent modulators.</description>

      <title>Designing de novo TIM Barrels: Insights into Stabilization, Diversification, and Functionalization Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TIM-barrel fold is one of the most versatile and ubiquitous protein folds in nature, hosting a wide variety of catalytic activities and functions while serving as a model system in protein biochemistry and engineering. This review explores its role as a key fold model in protein design, particularly in addressing challenges in stabilization and functionalization. We discuss historical and recent advances in de novo TIM barrel design from the landmark creation of sTIM11 to the development of the diversified variants, with a special focus on deepening our understanding of the determinants that modulate the sequence-structure-function relationships of this architecture. Also, we examine why the diversification of de novo TIM barrels towards functionalization remains a major challenge, given the absence of natural-like active site features. Current approaches have focused on incorporating structural extensions, modifying loops, and using cutting-edge AI-based strategies to create scaffolds with tailored characteristics. Despite significant advances, achieving enzymatically active de novo TIM barrels has been proven difficult, with only recent breakthroughs demonstrating functionalized designs. We discuss the limitations of stepwise functionalization approaches and support an integrated approach that simultaneously optimizes scaffold structure and active site shape, using both physical- and AI-driven methods. By combining computational and experimental insights, we highlight the TIM barrel as a powerful template for custom enzyme design and as a model system to explore the intersection of protein biochemistry, biophysics, and design.</description>

      <title>Chemical classification program synthesis using generative artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed classification rules, or are deep learning methods that lack explainability.
  This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO).
  We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our results against deep learning models and a naive SMARTS pattern based classifier. C3PO outperforms the naive classifier, but does not reach the performance of state of the art deep learning methods. However, C3PO has a number of strengths that complement deep learning methods, including explainability and reduced data dependence. C3PO can be used alongside deep learning classifiers to provide an explanation of the classification, where both methods agree. The programs can be used as part of the ontology development process, and iteratively refined by expert human curators.</description>
