      <title>Monitoring of neoadjuvant chemotherapy through time domain diffuse optics: Breast tissue composition changes and collagen discriminative potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this clinical study is to test broad spectral range (635-1060 nm) time domain diffuse optical spectroscopy in monitoring the response of breast cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The broadband operation allows us to fully analyze tissue composition in terms of hemoglobin, water, lipids and collagen concentration, which has never been systematically studied until now during the course of therapy. Patients are subjected to multiple breast optical imaging sessions, each one performed at different stages of NAC, both on tumor-bearing and contralateral healthy breast. We correlate the optical results with conventional imaging techniques and pathological response. Preliminary outcomes on data of 10 patients show an average significant reduction in the concentrations of oxy-hemoglobin (-53%, p = 0.0020), collagen (-36%, p = 0.0039) and water (-15%, p = 0.0195), and increase in lipids (+39%, p = 0.0137) from baseline to the end of therapy in the tumor-bearing breast of patients who responded to therapy at least partially. With respect to scattering, the scattering amplitude, a, increases slightly by the end of the therapy compared to the baseline, while the scattering slope, b, shows no significant change. Some change in concentrations of constituents was noticed also in the contralateral healthy breast, even though it was significant only for oxy-hemoglobin concentration. Collagen seems to be the only component distinguishing between complete (p = 0.0423) and partial responders (p = 0.1012) by the end of 2-3 weeks after the start of therapy, suggesting that it could serve as a potential biomarker to measure NAC effectiveness early during treatment. These initial results are consistent with those of standard medical modalities and highlight the sensitivity of the technique to changes that occur in breast composition during NAC.</description>

      <title>ResNCT: A Deep Learning Model for the Synthesis of Nephrographic Phase Images in CT Urography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and evaluate a transformer-based deep learning model for the synthesis of nephrographic phase images in CT urography (CTU) examinations from the unenhanced and urographic phases.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. A dataset of 119 patients (mean $\pm$ SD age, 65 $\pm$ 12 years; 75/44 males/females) with three-phase CT urography studies was curated for deep learning model development. The three phases for each patient were aligned with an affine registration algorithm. A custom model, coined Residual transformer model for Nephrographic phase CT image synthesis (ResNCT), was developed and implemented with paired inputs of non-contrast and urographic sets of images trained to produce the nephrographic phase images, that were compared with the corresponding ground truth nephrographic phase images. The synthesized images were evaluated with multiple performance metrics, including peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), normalized cross correlation coefficient (NCC), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).
  Results: The ResNCT model successfully generated synthetic nephrographic images from non-contrast and urographic image inputs. With respect to ground truth nephrographic phase images, the images synthesized by the model achieved high PSNR (27.8 $\pm$ 2.7 dB), SSIM (0.88 $\pm$ 0.05), and NCC (0.98 $\pm$ 0.02), and low MAE (0.02 $\pm$ 0.005) and RMSE (0.042 $\pm$ 0.016).
  Conclusion: The ResNCT model synthesized nephrographic phase CT images with high similarity to ground truth images. The ResNCT model provides a means of eliminating the acquisition of the nephrographic phase with a resultant 33% reduction in radiation dose for CTU examinations.</description>

      <title>A wearable anti-gravity supplement to therapy does not improve arm function in chronic stroke: a randomized trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Gravity confounds arm movement ability in post-stroke hemiparesis. Reducing its influence allows effective practice leading to recovery. Yet, there is a scarcity of wearable devices suitable for personalized use across diverse therapeutic activities in the clinic. Objective: In this study, we investigated the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of anti-gravity therapy using the ExoNET device in post-stroke participants. Methods: Twenty chronic stroke survivors underwent six, 45-minute occupational therapy sessions while wearing the ExoNET, randomized into either the treatment (ExoNET tuned to gravity-support) or control group (ExoNET tuned to slack condition). Clinical outcomes were evaluated by a blinded-rater at baseline, post, and six-week follow-up sessions. Kinetic, kinematic, and patient experience outcomes were also assessed. Results: Mixed-effect models showed a significant improvement in Box and Blocks scores in the post-intervention session for the treatment group (effect size: 2.1, p = .04). No significant effects were found between the treatment and control groups for ARAT scores and other clinical metrics. Direct kinetic effects revealed a significant reduction in muscle activity during free exploration with an effect size of (-7.12%, p&lt; 005). There were no significant longitudinal kinetic or kinematic trends. Subject feedback suggested a generally positive perception of the anti-gravity therapy. Conclusions: Anti-gravity therapy with the ExoNET is a safe and feasible treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation. The device provided anti-gravity forces, did not encumber range of motion, and clinical metrics of anti-gravity therapy demonstrated improvements in gross manual dexterity. Further research is required to explore potential benefits in broader clinical metrics.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a novel proton-CT scanner based on Silicon and LaBr$_3$(Ce) detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treatment planning systems at proton-therapy centres generally use X-ray computed tomography (CT) as primary imaging technique to infer the proton treatment doses to tumour and healthy tissues. However, proton stopping powers in the body, as derived from X-ray images, suffer from important proton-range uncertainties. In order to reduce this uncertainty in range, one could use proton-CT images instead. The main goal of this work is to test the capabilities of a newly-developed proton-CT scanner, based on the use of a set of tracking detectors and a high energy resolution scintillator for the residual energy of the protons. Different custom-made phantoms were positioned at the field of view of the scanner and were irradiated with protons at the CCB proton-therapy center in Krakow. We measured with the phantoms at different angles and produced sinograms that were used to obtain reconstructed images by Filtered Back-Projection (FBP). The obtained images were used to determine the capabilities of our scanner in terms of spatial resolution and proton Relative Stopping Power mapping and validate its use as proton-CT scanner. The results show that the scanner can produce medium-high quality images, with spatial resolution better than 2 mm in radiography, below 3 mm in tomography and resolving power in the RSP comparable to other state of the art pCT cameras.</description>
