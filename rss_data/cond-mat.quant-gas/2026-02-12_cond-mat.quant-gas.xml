      <title>Properties of Bose-Einstein condensates with altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10362v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a weakly interacting two-component Bose--Einstein condensate in the miscible regime in the presence of \emph{altermagnetism}, i.e., a collinear and globally compensated magnetic order that breaks spin-rotation symmetry while maintaining zero net magnetization. Within Bogoliubov theory, we derive the quasiparticle spectrum and coherence factors and show that altermagnetic order generically induces an angular dependence of the low-energy excitations. As a result, the sound velocity, momentum-resolved magnetization in the quantum depletion, and density--spin response functions acquire anisotropic components. We show that these anisotropic contributions vanish after angular averaging, consistent with the defining feature of altermagnetism: nontrivial local spin polarization without a global magnetization. Finally, we evaluate the Lee--Huang--Yang correction to the ground-state energy in the altermagnetic phase. Our results should be testable with ultracold-atom experiments in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of matter-wave four-wave mixing in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates with tunable interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate four-wave mixing (FWM) of matter waves in two geometric configurations in $^{39}$K Bose-Einstein condensates with the atomic interaction tuned via Feshbach resonances. For one configuration with the single-spin component, the FWM yield increases with a larger scattering length. For the two-spin component configuration, we specifically investigate FWM in both the droplet and gas parameter regimes. We find that the FWM yield reaches its maximum near the critical parameter region between the gas and droplet phases. Our research can help to optimize the FWM yield for matter-wave amplification and entangled atom pair generation, making it conducive to applications in quantum information processing and precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Cosmological production of dark matter in the Universe and in the laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates cosmological particle production within Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes, both as a dark matter mechanism and through analog simulations using Bose-Einstein condensates. While a full theory of Quantum Gravity remains elusive, studying quantum fields on curved backgrounds provides essential insights into the early Universe. We focus on how dynamical spacetimes, particularly during inflation, generate particles from spectator fields influenced solely by geometry.
  The work is divided into four parts. Part I establishes the theoretical framework, covering cosmology, inflation, and the principles of analog gravity. Part II analyzes particle production in various inflationary models, showing that scalar and vector fields can account for observed dark matter abundance, especially through tachyonic instabilities. Part III explores BEC experiments, mapping phonons to scalar fields in expanding universes. We demonstrate the reconstruction of expansion histories, reinterpret production as a scattering problem, and propose methods to measure entanglement between produced pairs. Finally, Part IV addresses quantum vacuum ambiguities and the impact of non-adiabatic transitions during the "switch-on" and "switch-off" of expansion.
  Ultimately, this work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production for dark matter and the power of analog experiments to enhance our understanding of quantum effects in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Mapping reservoir-enhanced superconductivity to near-long-range magnetic order in the undoped 1D Anderson- and Kondo-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The undoped Kondo necklace in 1D is a paradigmatic and well understood model of a Kondo insulator. This work performs the first large-scale study of the 1D Anderson-lattice underlying the Kondo necklace with quasi-exact numerical methods, comparing this with the perturbative effective 1D Kondo-necklace model derived from the former. This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems. Our work reveals that below the length-scales on which the insulating state sets in, which can be very large, superconducting and density-density correlations are degenerate and may both appear to approach an almost ordered state, to a degree that far exceeds that of any isolated 1D pairing layer with short-range interactions. We trace these effects to the effective extended-range coupling that the metallic layer mediates within the pairing layer. These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer. The effects we predict could be tested either by local probes of quasi-1D heavy fermion compounds such as CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, in engineered chains of ad-atoms or in ultracold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Spectral functions of the strongly interacting 3D Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing dynamical properties of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems poses a major challenge to theoretical approaches. Usually, one has to resort to numerical analytic continuation of results on imaginary frequencies, which is a mathematically ill-defined procedure. Here, we present an efficient method to compute the spectral functions of the two-component Fermi gas near the strongly interacting unitary limit directly in real frequencies. To this end, we combine the Keldysh path integral that is defined in real time with the self-consistent T-matrix approximation. The latter is known to predict thermodynamic and transport properties in good agreement with experimental observations in ultracold atoms. We validate our method by comparison with thermodynamic quantities obtained from imaginary time calculations and by transforming our real-time propagators to imaginary time. By comparison with state-of-the-art numerical analytic continuation of the imaginary time results, we show that our real-time results give qualitative improvements for dynamical quantities. Moreover, we show that no significant pseudogap regime exists in the self-consistent T-matrix approximation above the critical temperature $T_c$, an issue that has been under significant debate. We close by pointing out the versatile nature of our method as it can be extended to other systems, like the spin- or mass-imbalanced Fermi gas, other Bose-Fermi models, 2D systems as well as systems out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Measuring R\'enyi entropy using a projected Loschmidt echo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present efficient and practical protocols to measure the second R\'enyi entropy (RE), whose exponential is known as the purity. We achieve this by establishing a direct connection to a Loschmidt echo (LE) type measurement sequence, applicable to quantum many-body systems. Notably, our approach does not rely on random-noise averaging, a feature that can be extended to protocols to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), as we demonstrate. By way of example, we show that our protocols can be practically implemented in superconducting qubit-based platforms, as well as in cavity-QED trapped ultra-cold gases.</description>

      <title>Repulsively Bound Hadrons in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory is a paradigmatic model that exhibits gauge-field-mediated-confinement of pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to two separate mechanisms to form stable ``hadron'' bound states of two mesons: either induced by an effective attractive interaction, or a new dynamical binding mechanism induced by an effective repulsion. The repulsively bound hadron is a high-energy state stabilized by being energetically separated from the two-meson continuum through quantum fluctuations of the gauge fields. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom arrays.</description>
