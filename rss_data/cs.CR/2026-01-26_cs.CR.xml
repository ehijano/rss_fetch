      <title>Algorithmic Identity Based on Metaparameters: A Path to Reliability, Auditability, and Traceability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of algorithms is increasing across various fields such as healthcare, justice, finance, and education. This growth has significantly accelerated with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies based on Large Language Models (LLMs) since 2022. This expansion presents substantial challenges related to accountability, ethics, and transparency. This article explores the potential of the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to identify algorithms, aiming to enhance accountability, transparency, and reliability in their development and application, particularly in AI agents and multimodal LLMs. The use of DOIs facilitates tracking the origin of algorithms, enables audits, prevents biases, promotes research reproducibility, and strengthens ethical considerations. The discussion addresses the challenges and solutions associated with maintaining algorithms identified by DOI, their application in API security, and the proposal of a cryptographic authentication protocol.</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm for Trusted Respiratory Monitoring Via Consumer Electronics-grade Radar Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Respiratory monitoring is an extremely important task in modern medical services. Due to its significant advantages, e.g., non-contact, radar-based respiratory monitoring has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. Unfortunately, though it can achieve high monitoring accuracy, consumer electronics-grade radar data inevitably contains User-sensitive Identity Information (USI), which may be maliciously used and further lead to privacy leakage. To track these challenges, by variational mode decomposition (VMD) and adversarial loss-based encryption, we propose a novel Trusted Respiratory Monitoring paradigm, Tru-RM, to perform automated respiratory monitoring through radio signals while effectively anonymizing USI. The key enablers of Tru-RM are Attribute Feature Decoupling (AFD), Flexible Perturbation Encryptor (FPE), and robust Perturbation Tolerable Network (PTN) used for attribute decomposition, identity encryption, and perturbed respiratory monitoring, respectively. Specifically, AFD is designed to decompose the raw radar signals into the universal respiratory component, the personal difference component, and other unrelated components. Then, by using large noise to drown out the other unrelated components, and the phase noise algorithm with a learning intensity parameter to eliminate USI in the personal difference component, FPE is designed to achieve complete user identity information encryption without affecting respiratory features. Finally, by designing the transferred generalized domain-independent network, PTN is employed to accurately detect respiration when waveforms change significantly. Extensive experiments based on various detection distances, respiratory patterns, and durations demonstrate the superior performance of Tru-RM on strong anonymity of USI, and high detection accuracy of perturbed respiratory waveforms.</description>

      <title>FC-GUARD: Enabling Anonymous yet Compliant Fiat-to-Cryptocurrency Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of decentralized finance, fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchange platforms have become popular entry points into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, these platforms frequently fail to ensure adequate privacy protection, as evidenced by real-world breaches that exposed personally identifiable information (PII) and crypto addresses. Such leaks enable adversaries to link real-world identities to cryptocurrency transactions, undermining the presumed anonymity of cryptocurrency use.
  We propose FC-GUARD, a privacy-preserving exchange system designed to preserve user anonymity without compromising regulatory compliance in the exchange of fiat currency for cryptocurrencies. Leveraging verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proof techniques, FC-GUARD enables fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchanges without revealing users' PII or fiat account details. This breaks the linkage between users' real-world identities and their cryptocurrency addresses, thereby upholding anonymity, a fundamental expectation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In addition, FC-GUARD complies with key regulations over cryptocurrency usage, such as know-your-customer requirements and auditability for tax reporting obligations by integrating a lawful de-anonymization mechanism that allows the auditing authority to identify misbehaving users. This ensures regulatory compliance while defaulting to privacy protection. We implement our system on both desktop and mobile platforms, and our evaluation shows its feasibility for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>NOIR: Privacy-Preserving Generation of Code with Open-Source LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although boosting software development performance, large language model (LLM)-powered code generation introduces intellectual property and data security risks rooted in the fact that a service provider (cloud) observes a client's prompts and generated code, which can be proprietary in commercial systems. To mitigate this problem, we propose NOIR, the first framework to protect the client's prompts and generated code from the cloud. NOIR uses an encoder and a decoder at the client to encode and send the prompts' embeddings to the cloud to get enriched embeddings from the LLM, which are then decoded to generate the code locally at the client. Since the cloud can use the embeddings to infer the prompt and the generated code, NOIR introduces a new mechanism to achieve indistinguishability, a local differential privacy protection at the token embedding level, in the vocabulary used in the prompts and code, and a data-independent and randomized tokenizer on the client side. These components effectively defend against reconstruction and frequency analysis attacks by an honest-but-curious cloud. Extensive analysis and results using open-source LLMs show that NOIR significantly outperforms existing baselines on benchmarks, including the Evalplus (MBPP and HumanEval, Pass@1 of 76.7 and 77.4), and BigCodeBench (Pass@1 of 38.7, only a 1.77% drop from the original LLM) under strong privacy against attacks.</description>

      <title>Ringmaster: How to juggle high-throughput host OS system calls from TrustZone TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many safety-critical systems require timely processing of sensor inputs to avoid potential safety hazards. Additionally, to support useful application features, such systems increasingly have a large rich operating system (OS) at the cost of potential security bugs. Thus, if a malicious party gains supervisor privileges, they could cause real-world damage by denying service to time-sensitive programs. Many past approaches to this problem completely isolate time-sensitive programs with a hypervisor; however, this prevents the programs from accessing useful OS services
  We introduce Ringmaster, a novel framework that enables enclaves or TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) to asynchronously access rich, but potentially untrusted, OS services via Linux's io_uring. When service is denied by the untrusted OS, enclaves continue to operate on Ringmaster's minimal ARM TrustZone kernel with access to small, critical device drivers. This approach balances the need for secure, time-sensitive processing with the convenience of rich OS services. Additionally, Ringmaster supports large unmodified programs as enclaves, offering lower overhead compared to existing systems. We demonstrate how Ringmaster helps us build a working highly-secure system with minimal engineering. In our experiments with an unmanned aerial vehicle, Ringmaster achieved nearly 1GiB/sec of data into enclave on a Raspberry Pi4b, 0-3% throughput overhead compared to non-enclave tasks.</description>

      <title>Cutting the Gordian Knot: Detecting Malicious PyPI Packages via a Knowledge-Mining Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Python Package Index (PyPI) has become a target for malicious actors, yet existing detection tools generate false positive rates of 15-30%, incorrectly flagging one-third of legitimate packages as malicious. This problem arises because current tools rely on simple syntactic rules rather than semantic understanding, failing to distinguish between identical API calls serving legitimate versus malicious purposes. To address this challenge, we propose PyGuard, a knowledge-driven framework that converts detection failures into useful behavioral knowledge by extracting patterns from existing tools' false positives and negatives. Our method utilizes hierarchical pattern mining to identify behavioral sequences that distinguish malicious from benign code, employs Large Language Models to create semantic abstractions beyond syntactic variations, and combines this knowledge into a detection system that integrates exact pattern matching with contextual reasoning. PyGuard achieves 99.50% accuracy with only 2 false positives versus 1,927-2,117 in existing tools, maintains 98.28% accuracy on obfuscated code, and identified 219 previously unknown malicious packages in real-world deployment. The behavioral patterns show cross-ecosystem applicability with 98.07% accuracy on NPM packages, demonstrating that semantic understanding enables knowledge transfer across programming languages.</description>

      <title>Secure Intellicise Wireless Network: Agentic AI for Coverless Semantic Steganography Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SemCom), leveraging its significant advantages in transmission efficiency and reliability, has emerged as a core technology for constructing future intellicise (intelligent and concise) wireless networks. However, intelligent attacks represented by semantic eavesdropping pose severe challenges to the security of SemCom. To address this challenge, Semantic Steganographic Communication (SemSteCom) achieves ``invisible'' encryption by implicitly embedding private semantic information into cover modality carriers. The state-of-the-art study has further introduced generative diffusion models to directly generate stega images without relying on original cover images, effectively enhancing steganographic capacity. Nevertheless, the recovery process of private images is highly dependent on the guidance of private semantic keys, which may be inferred by intelligent eavesdroppers, thereby introducing new security threats. To address this issue, we propose an Agentic AI-driven SemSteCom (AgentSemSteCom) scheme, which includes semantic extraction, digital token controlled reference image generation, coverless steganography, semantic codec, and optional task-oriented enhancement modules. The proposed AgentSemSteCom scheme obviates the need for both cover images and private semantic keys, thereby boosting steganographic capacity while reinforcing transmission security. The simulation results on open-source datasets verify that, AgentSemSteCom achieves better transmission quality and higher security levels than the baseline scheme.</description>

      <title>DeMark: A Query-Free Black-Box Attack on Deepfake Watermarking Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of realistic deepfakes has raised urgent concerns over their misuse, motivating the use of defensive watermarks in synthetic images for reliable detection and provenance tracking. However, this defense paradigm assumes such watermarks are inherently resistant to removal. We challenge this assumption with DeMark, a query-free black-box attack framework that targets defensive image watermarking schemes for deepfakes. DeMark exploits latent-space vulnerabilities in encoder-decoder watermarking models through a compressive sensing based sparsification process, suppressing watermark signals while preserving perceptual and structural realism appropriate for deepfakes. Across eight state-of-the-art watermarking schemes, DeMark reduces watermark detection accuracy from 100% to 32.9% on average while maintaining natural visual quality, outperforming existing attacks. We further evaluate three defense strategies, including image super resolution, sparse watermarking, and adversarial training, and find them largely ineffective. These results demonstrate that current encoder decoder watermarking schemes remain vulnerable to latent-space manipulations, underscoring the need for more robust watermarking methods to safeguard against deepfakes.</description>

      <title>A High Performance and Efficient Post-Quantum Crypto-Processor for FrodoKEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FrodoKEM is a lattice-based post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). It has been considered for standardization by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) due to its robust security profile. However, its hardware implementation exhibits a weakness of high latency and heavy resource burden, hindering its practical application. Moreover, diverse usage scenarios call for comprehensive functionality. To address these challenges, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient crypto-processor for FrodoKEM. A multiple-instruction overlapped execution scheme is introduced to enable efficient multi-module scheduling and minimize operational latency. Furthermore, a high-speed, reconfigurable parallel multiplier array is integrated to handle intensive matrix computations under diverse computation patterns, significantly enhancing hardware efficiency. In addition, a compact memory scheduling strategy shortens the lifespan of intermediate matrices, thereby reducing overall storage requirements. The proposed design provides full support for all FrodoKEM security levels and protocol phases. It consumes 13467 LUTs, 6042 FFs, and 14 BRAMs on an Artix-7 FPGA and achieves the fastest reported execution time. Compared with state-of-the-art hardware implementations, our design improves the area-time product (ATP) by 1.75-2.00 times.</description>

      <title>SafeThinker: Reasoning about Risk to Deepen Safety Beyond Shallow Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the intrinsic risk-awareness of Large Language Models (LLMs), current defenses often result in shallow safety alignment, rendering models vulnerable to disguised attacks (e.g., prefilling) while degrading utility. To bridge this gap, we propose SafeThinker, an adaptive framework that dynamically allocates defensive resources via a lightweight gateway classifier. Based on the gateway's risk assessment, inputs are routed through three distinct mechanisms: (i) a Standardized Refusal Mechanism for explicit threats to maximize efficiency; (ii) a Safety-Aware Twin Expert (SATE) module to intercept deceptive attacks masquerading as benign queries; and (iii) a Distribution-Guided Think (DDGT) component that adaptively intervenes during uncertain generation. Experiments show that SafeThinker significantly lowers attack success rates across diverse jailbreak strategies without compromising utility, demonstrating that coordinating intrinsic judgment throughout the generation process effectively balances robustness and practicality.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Attacks on Ethereum's Peer-to-Peer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipse attacks isolate blockchain nodes by monopolizing their peer-to-peer connections. The attacks were extensively studied in Bitcoin (SP'15, SP'20, CCS'21, SP'23) and Monero (NDSS'25), but their practicality against Ethereum nodes remains underexplored, particularly in the post-Merge settings.
  We present the first end-to-end implementation of an eclipse attack targeting Ethereum (2.0 version) execution-layer nodes. Our attack exploits the bootstrapping and peer management logic of Ethereum to fully isolate a node upon restart. We introduce a multi-stage strategy that majorly includes (i) poisoning the node's discovery table via unsolicited messages, (ii) infiltrating Ethereum's DNS-based peerlist by identifying and manipulating the official DNS crawler, and (iii) hijacking idle incoming connection slots across the network to block benign connections. Our DNS list poisoning is the first in the cryptocurrency context and requires only 28 IP addresses over 100 days. Slots hijacking raises outgoing redirection success from 45\% to 95\%. We validate our approach through controlled experiments on Ethereum's Sepolia testnet and broad measurements on the mainnet. Our findings demonstrate that over 80\% of public nodes do not leave sufficient idle capacity for effective slots occupation, highlighting the feasibility and severity of the threat. We further propose concrete countermeasures and responsibly disclosed all findings to Ethereum's security team.</description>

      <title>Emerging Threats and Countermeasures in Neuromorphic Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing mimics brain-inspired mechanisms through spiking neurons and energy-efficient processing, offering a pathway to efficient in-memory computing (IMC). However, these advancements raise critical security and privacy concerns. As the adoption of bio-inspired architectures and memristive devices increases, so does the urgency to assess the vulnerability of these emerging technologies to hardware and software attacks. Emerging architectures introduce new attack surfaces, particularly due to asynchronous, event-driven processing and stochastic device behavior. The integration of memristors into neuromorphic hardware and software implementations in spiking neural networks offers diverse possibilities for advanced computing architectures, including their role in security-aware applications. This survey systematically analyzes the security landscape of neuromorphic systems, covering attack methodologies, side-channel vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. We focus on both hardware and software concerns relevant to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and hardware primitives, such as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) for cryptographic and secure computation applications. We approach this analysis from diverse perspectives, from attack methodologies to countermeasure strategies that integrate efficiency and protection in brain-inspired hardware. This review not only maps the current landscape of security threats but provides a foundation for developing secure and trustworthy neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>From Transactions to Exploits: Automated PoC Synthesis for Real-World DeFi Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain systems are increasingly targeted by on-chain attacks that exploit contract vulnerabilities to extract value rapidly and stealthily, making systematic analysis and reproduction highly challenging. In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ransomware core capability, unauthorized encryption, demands controls that identify and block malicious cryptographic activity without disrupting legitimate use. We present a probabilistic, risk-based access control architecture that couples machine learning inference with mandatory access control to regulate encryption on Linux in real time. The system builds a specialized dataset from the native ftrace framework using the function_graph tracer, yielding high-resolution kernel-function execution traces augmented with resource and I/O counters. These traces support both a supervised classifier and interpretable rules that drive an SELinux policy via lightweight booleans, enabling context-sensitive permit/deny decisions at the moment encryption begins. Compared to approaches centered on sandboxing, hypervisor introspection, or coarse system-call telemetry, the function-level tracing we adopt provides finer behavioral granularity than syscall-only telemetry while avoiding the virtualization/VMI overhead of sandbox-based approaches. Our current user-space prototype has a non-trivial footprint under burst I/O; we quantify it and recognize that a production kernel-space solution should aim to address this. We detail dataset construction, model training and rule extraction, and the run-time integration that gates file writes for suspect encryption while preserving benign cryptographic workflows. During evaluation, the two-layer composition retains model-level detection quality while delivering rule-like responsiveness; we also quantify operational footprint and outline engineering steps to reduce CPU and memory overhead for enterprise deployment. The result is a practical path from behavioral tracing and learning to enforceable, explainable, and risk-proportionate encryption control on production Linux systems.</description>

      <title>Network Security under Heterogeneous Cyber-Risk Profiles and Contagion</title>

Abstract: Cyber risk has become a critical financial threat in today's interconnected digital economy. This paper introduces a cyber-risk management framework for networked digital systems that combines the strategic behavior of players with contagion dynamics within a security game. We address the problem of optimally allocating cybersecurity resources across a network, focusing on the heterogeneous valuations of nodes by attackers and defenders, some areas may be of high interest to the attacker, while others are prioritized by the defender. We explore how this asymmetry drives attack and defense strategies and shapes the system's overall resilience. We extend a method to determine optimal resource allocation based on simple network metrics weighted by the defender's and attacker's risk profiles. We further propose risk measures based on contagion paths and analyze how propagation dynamics influence optimal defense strategies. Numerical experiments explore risk versus cost efficient frontiers varying network topologies and risk profiles, revealing patterns of resource allocation and cyber deception effects. These findings provide actionable insights for designing resilient digital infrastructures and mitigating systemic cyber risk.</description>

      <title>Bridging Expert Reasoning and LLM Detection: A Knowledge-Driven Framework for Malicious Packages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source ecosystems such as NPM and PyPI are increasingly targeted by supply chain attacks, yet existing detection methods either depend on fragile handcrafted rules or data-driven features that fail to capture evolving attack semantics. We present IntelGuard, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based framework that integrates expert analytical reasoning into automated malicious package detection. IntelGuard constructs a structured knowledge base from over 8,000 threat intelligence reports, linking malicious code snippets with behavioral descriptions and expert reasoning. When analyzing new packages, it retrieves semantically similar malicious examples and applies LLM-guided reasoning to assess whether code behaviors align with intended functionality. Experiments on 4,027 real-world packages show that IntelGuard achieves 99% accuracy and a 0.50% false positive rate, while maintaining 96.5% accuracy on obfuscated code. Deployed on PyPI.org, it discovered 54 previously unreported malicious packages, demonstrating interpretable and robust detection guided by expert knowledge.</description>

      <title>"What I Sign Is Not What I See": Towards Explainable and Trustworthy Cryptocurrency Wallet Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency wallets have become the primary gateway to decentralized applications, yet users often face significant difficulty in discerning what a wallet signature actually does or entails. Prior work has mainly focused on mitigating protocol vulnerabilities, with limited attention to how users perceive and interpret what they are authorizing. To examine this usability-security gap, we conducted two formative studies investigating how users interpret authentic signing requests and what cues they rely on to assess risk. Findings reveal that users often misread critical parameters, underestimate high-risk signatures, and rely on superficial familiarity rather than understanding transaction intent. Building on these insights, we designed the Signature Semantic Decoder -- a prototype framework that reconstructs and visualizes the intent behind wallet signatures prior to confirmation. Through structured parsing and semantic labeling, it demonstrates how signing data can be transformed into plain-language explanations with contextual risk cues. In a between-subjects user study (N = 128), participants using the prototype achieved higher accuracy in identifying risky signatures, improved clarity and decision confidence, and lower cognitive workload compared with the baseline wallet interface. Our study reframes wallet signing as a problem of interpretability within secure interaction design and offers design implications for more transparent and trustworthy cryptocurrency wallet interfaces.</description>

      <title>ProveRAG: Provenance-Driven Vulnerability Analysis with Automated Retrieval-Augmented LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cybersecurity, security analysts constantly face the challenge of mitigating newly discovered vulnerabilities in real-time, with over 300,000 vulnerabilities identified since 1999. The sheer volume of known vulnerabilities complicates the detection of patterns for unknown threats. While LLMs can assist, they often hallucinate and lack alignment with recent threats. Over 40,000 vulnerabilities have been identified in 2024 alone, which are introduced after most popular LLMs' (e.g., GPT-5) training data cutoff. This raises a major challenge of leveraging LLMs in cybersecurity, where accuracy and up-to-date information are paramount. Therefore, we aim to improve the adaptation of LLMs in vulnerability analysis by mimicking how an analyst performs such tasks. We propose ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system designed to assist in rapidly analyzing vulnerabilities with automated retrieval augmentation of web data while self-evaluating its responses with verifiable evidence. ProveRAG incorporates a self-critique mechanism to help alleviate the omission and hallucination common in the output of LLMs applied in cybersecurity applications. The system cross-references data from verifiable sources (NVD and CWE), giving analysts confidence in the actionable insights provided. Our results indicate that ProveRAG excels in delivering verifiable evidence to the user with over 99% and 97% accuracy in exploitation and mitigation strategies, respectively. ProveRAG guides analysts to secure their systems more effectively by overcoming temporal and context-window limitations while also documenting the process for future audits.</description>

      <title>Assessing Vulnerability in Smart Contracts: The Role of Code Complexity Metrics in Security Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17343v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Software built on poor structural patterns often shows higher exposure to security defects. When code differs from established best practices, verification and maintenance become increasingly difficult, thereby raising the risk of unintentional vulnerabilities. In the context of blockchain technology, where immutable smart contracts handle high-value transactions, the need for strict security assurance is important. This research analyzes the utility of software complexity metrics as diagnostic tools for identifying vulnerable Solidity smart contracts. We evaluate the hypothesis that complexity measures serve as vital, complementary signals for security assessment. Through an empirical examination of 21 distinct metrics, we analyzed their inter-dependencies, statistical association with vulnerabilities, and discriminative capabilities. Our findings indicate a significant degree of redundancy among certain metrics and a relatively low correlation between any single metric and the presence of vulnerabilities. However, the data demonstrates that these metrics possess strong power to distinguish between secure and vulnerable code when analyzed collectively. Notably, with only three exceptions, vulnerable contracts consistently exhibited higher mean complexity scores than their neutral counterparts. While our results show a statistical association, we emphasize that complexity is an indicator rather than a direct cause of vulnerability.</description>

      <title>DPBloomfilter: Securing Bloom Filters with Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bloom filter is a simple yet space-efficient probabilistic data structure that supports membership queries for dramatically large datasets. It is widely utilized and implemented across various industrial scenarios, often handling massive datasets that include sensitive user information necessitating privacy preservation. To address the challenge of maintaining privacy within the Bloom filter, we have developed the DPBloomfilter. This innovation integrates the classical differential privacy mechanism, specifically the Random Response technique, into the Bloom filter, offering robust privacy guarantees under the same running complexity as the standard Bloom filter. Through rigorous simulation experiments, we have demonstrated that our DPBloomfilter algorithm maintains high utility while ensuring privacy protections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide differential privacy guarantees for the Bloom filter for membership query problems.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Minimization for Side-Channel Attack Resistance via Optimal Noise Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Side-channel attacks (SCAs) pose a serious threat to system security by extracting secret keys through physical leakages such as power consumption, timing variations, and electromagnetic emissions. Among existing countermeasures, artificial noise injection is recognized as one of the most effective techniques. However, its high power consumption poses a major challenge for resource-constrained systems such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, motivating the development of more efficient protection schemes. In this paper, we model SCAs as a communication channel and aim to suppress information leakage by minimizing the mutual information between the secret information and side-channel observations, subject to a power constraint on the artificial noise. We propose an optimal artificial noise injection method that minimizes the mutual information under power constraints for artificial noise. Specifically, we formulate two convex optimization problems: 1) minimizing the total mutual information, and 2) minimizing the maximum mutual information across observations. Our first major contribution is proposing an optimal artificial noise injection framework for the case of Gaussian input, where the mutual information becomes the channel capacity, which is one way to quantify the information leakage. Our second major contribution extends the optimization framework to arbitrary input distributions. We identify conditions ensuring the convexity of the optimization problem and derive the optimal solution using the fundamental relationship between the mutual information and the minimum mean squared error. The simulation results show that the proposed methods significantly reduce both total and maximum mutual information compared to conventional techniques, confirming their effectiveness for resource-constrained, security-critical systems.</description>

      <title>Guardians of the Regime: Secret Police Formation in Autocracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autocrats use secret police to stay in power, as these organizations deter and suppress opposition to their rule. Existing research shows that secret police succeed at this but, surprisingly, also that they are not as ubiquitous in autocracies as one may assume, existing in fewer than half of autocratic country-years. We thus explore under which conditions secret police emerge in dictatorships. For this purpose, we develop a theoretical framework for potential predictors and apply statistical variable selection techniques to identify which of several candidate variables extracted from the literature on state security forces and authoritarian survival hold explanatory power. Our results highlight that secret police are more likely to emerge when rulers face structural, regime-external threats, such as organised anti-system mobilisation and international rivals, or witness successful regime-internal contestation abroad that hints at similar threats at home. But additionally, we find that rulers must have sufficient material resources and personalised power to establish secret police. This research contributes to our understanding of autocrats' institutional choices and authoritarian politics.</description>

      <title>LLM Jailbreak Detection for (Almost) Free!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enhance security through alignment when widely used, but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks capable of producing inappropriate content. Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs. In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional computational costs during LLM inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) embeds a statistical signal during generation to enable detection of model-produced text. While watermarking has proven effective in benign settings, its robustness under adversarial evasion remains contested. To advance a rigorous understanding and evaluation of such vulnerabilities, we propose the \emph{Bias-Inversion Rewriting Attack} (BIRA), which is theoretically motivated and model-agnostic. BIRA weakens the watermark signal by suppressing the logits of likely watermarked tokens during LLM-based rewriting, without any knowledge of the underlying watermarking scheme. Across recent watermarking methods, BIRA achieves over 99\% evasion while preserving the semantic content of the original text. Beyond demonstrating an attack, our results reveal a systematic vulnerability, emphasizing the need for stress testing and robust defenses.</description>

      <title>DSSmoothing: Toward Certified Dataset Ownership Verification for Pre-trained Language Models via Dual-Space Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs under a gray-box setting (i.e., the defender can only query the suspicious model but is aware of its input representation module), based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/DSSmoothing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malware often uses obfuscation to hinder security analysis. Among these techniques, virtualization-based obfuscation is particularly strong because it protects programs by translating original instructions into attacker-defined virtual machine (VM) bytecode, producing long and complex code that is difficult to analyze and deobfuscate. This paper aims to identify the structural components of virtualization-based obfuscation through static analysis. By examining the execution model of obfuscated code, we define and detect the key elements required for deobfuscation-namely the dispatch routine, handler blocks, and the VM region-using LLVM IR. Experimental results show that, in the absence of compiler optimizations, the proposed LLVM Pass successfully detects all core structures across major virtualization options, including switch, direct, and indirect modes.</description>

      <title>Provable Differentially Private Computation of the Cross-Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-attention has emerged as a cornerstone module in modern artificial intelligence, underpinning critical applications such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), system prompting, and guided stable diffusion. However, this is a rising concern about securing the privacy of cross-attention, as the underlying key and value matrices frequently encode sensitive data or private user information. In this work, we introduce a novel data structure designed to enforce differential privacy (DP) for cross-attention mechanisms, accompanied by provable theoretical guarantees. Specifically, letting $n$ denote the input sequence length, $d$ the feature dimension, $R$ the maximum magnitude of query and key matrices, $R_w$ the maximum magnitude of the value matrix, and $r, s, \epsilon_s$ the parameters for polynomial kernel methods, our proposed structure achieves $\widetilde{O}(ndr^2)$ space and initialization complexity, with a query time of $\widetilde{O}(d r^2)$ per token. Moreover, we demonstrate that our mechanism satisfies $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, incurring an additive error of $\widetilde{O}((1-\epsilon_s)^{-1} n^{-1} \epsilon^{-1} R^{2s} R_w r^2)$ and a relative error of $2\epsilon_s/(1-\epsilon_s)$ with respect to the ground truth. Crucially, our framework maintains robustness against adaptive queries, ensuring security even in adversarial settings. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first approach providing provable differential privacy for cross-attention, establishing a foundation for future privacy-preserving algorithms in large generative models (LGMs).</description>

      <title>Classport: Designing Runtime Dependency Introspection for Java</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Runtime introspection of dependencies, i.e., the ability to observe which dependencies are currently used during program execution, is fundamental for Software Supply Chain security. Yet, Java has no support for it. We solve this problem with Classport, a blueprint and system that embeds dependency information into Java class files, enabling the retrieval of dependency information at runtime. We evaluate Classport on six real-world projects, demonstrating the feasibility in identifying dependencies at runtime.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA): A Lifecycle Supervision Framework for Robustly Aligned AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit significant vulnerability to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated "Intent Graph"; and (ii) an innovative "Tiered Adjudicator" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.</description>

      <title>Insecure Ingredients? Exploring Dependency Update Patterns of Bundled JavaScript Packages on the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reusable software components, typically distributed as packages, are a central paradigm of modern software development. The JavaScript ecosystem serves as a prime example, offering millions of packages with their use being promoted as idiomatic. However, download statistics on npm raise security concerns as they indicate a high popularity of vulnerable package versions while their real prevalence on production websites remains unknown. Package version detection mechanisms fill this gap by extracting utilized packages and versions from observed artifacts on the web. Prior research focuses on mechanisms for either hand-selected popular packages in bundles or for single-file resources utilizing the global namespace. This does not allow for a thorough analysis of modern web applications' dependency update behavior at scale. In this work, we improve upon this by presenting Aletheia, a package-agnostic method which dissects JavaScript bundles to identify package versions through algorithms originating from the field of plagiarism detection. We show that this method clearly outperforms the existing approaches in practical settings. Furthermore, we crawl the Tranco top 100,000 domains to reveal that 5% - 20% of domains update their dependencies within 16 weeks. Surprisingly, from a longitudinal perspective, bundled packages are updated significantly faster than their CDN-included counterparts, with consequently up to 10 times fewer known vulnerable package versions included. Still, we observe indicators that few widespread vendors seem to be a major driving force behind timely updates, implying that quantitative measures are not painting a complete picture.</description>
