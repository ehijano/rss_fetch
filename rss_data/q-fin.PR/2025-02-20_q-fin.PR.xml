      <title>Calibration and Option Pricing with Stochastic Volatility and Double Exponential Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines a stochastic volatility model with double-exponential jumps in the context of option pricing. The model has been considered in previous research articles, but no thorough analysis has been conducted to study its quality of calibration and pricing capabilities thus far. We provide evidence that this model outperforms challenger models possessing similar features (stochastic volatility and jumps), especially in the fit of the short term implied volatility smile, and that it is particularly tractable for the pricing of exotic options from different generations. The article utilizes Fourier pricing techniques (the PROJ method and its refinements) for different types of claims and several generations of exotics (Asian options, cliquets, barrier options, and options on realized variance), and all source codes are made publicly available to facilitate adoption and future research. The results indicate that this model is highly promising, thanks to the asymmetry of the jumps distribution allowing it to capture richer dynamics than a normal jump size distribution. The parameters all have meaningful econometrics interpretations that are important for adoption by risk-managers.</description>

      <title>When defaults cannot be hedged: an actuarial approach to xVA calculations via local risk-minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the pricing and hedging of counterparty credit risk and funding when there is no possibility to hedge the jump to default of either the bank or the counterparty. This represents the situation which is most often encountered in practice, due to the absence of quoted corporate bonds or CDS contracts written on the counterparty and the difficulty for the bank to buy/sell protection on her own default. We apply local risk-minimization to find the optimal strategy and compute it via a BSDE.</description>
