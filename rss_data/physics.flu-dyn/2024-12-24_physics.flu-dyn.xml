      <title>Nutrient Transport in Concentration Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sessile ciliates attach to substrates and generate feeding currents to capture passing particulates and dissolved nutrients. Optimal ciliary activity that maximizes nutrient flux at the cell surface while minimizing the rate of hydrodynamic energy dissipation is well characterized in uniform nutrient fields. However, it is unclear how ciliary motion should change when nutrients are non-uniform or patchy. To address this question, we modeled the sessile ciliate and feeding currents using the spherical envelope model, and used an unsteady advection-diffusion equation to describe the nutrient scalar field. In the absence of flows, we calculated the diffusive nutrient uptake analytically in linear nutrient gradients and found no advantage over uptake in uniform fields. With ciliary activity driving feeding currents, we used a spectral method to solve for the unsteady nutrient concentration. We found that, when the axis of symmetry of the ciliary motion is aligned with the nutrient gradient, nutrient uptake at the cell surface increases steadily over time, with highest uptake achieved by the treadmill ciliary motion which is optimal in uniform fields as well. The associated nutrient uptake in concentration gradients scales with the square root of the product of time and P\'eclet number. In patchy environments, optimal ciliary activity depends on the nature of the patchiness. Our findings highlight strategies that enable sessile ciliates to thrive in environments with fluctuating nutrient availability.</description>

      <title>Modelling visibility and surface deformation in particle-fluid flow fields generated by helicopter rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a helicopter descends towards a bed of sand, a high velocity particle laden cloud can form around the helicopter body, a phenomenon known as "brownout", and a consequence of which can potentially be a significant deterioration in visibility for the helicopter pilot. Here we consider a recently developed physically based rational mathematical model for the generation of wind-driven particle flow fields from otherwise static particle beds, one application of which is the scenario considered here. We introduce a directional opacity measure, defined for each observation angle from the helicopter cockpit, and show how visibility may vary in the model as certain parameters are varied. In particular, we demonstrate a counterintuitive result suggesting that, with specific yet potentially realistic parameter choices, pilot visibility may be improved in some viewing directions if the helicopter were hovering at a lower altitude. We also calculate the associated deformation of the upper surface of the particle bed, and show how certain surface deformation features may be sensitive to variation of key parameters.</description>

      <title>Worthington Jets during Water Entry of Spheres with no Cavity Formed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water entry problem has extensive applications in numerous areas of nature, industry, and science. Here, we investigate the Worthington jets generated during the water entry of solid spheres with no cavity formed experimentally and theoretically. Three different pinch-off modes are identified in experiments, which depend solely on the release height H and the diameter of the sphere D, regardless of the material of the sphere. A brief dimensional analysis of the experimental data indicates that the dimensionless maximum height of the jet h/D is proportional to the Froude number, defined as Fr=2H/D. Based on the basic solution of flow past a sphere and the application of a reasonable potential function near the free surface, a theoretical model is developed diverging from the Rayleigh-Besant problem. Predictions regarding the shape and maximum height of the jet show good agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation of turbulent smooth body separation using the OpenFOAM flow solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the current wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) capabilities of the open-source computational fluid dynamics solver OpenFOAM, which is used widely in academia and industry. This is achieved by a simulation campaign that covers both attached and smooth body separation cases. The campaign includes simulations using four different wall models and aims to investigate the sensitivity of the results to changes in numerics, mesh resolution, and subgrid-scale modeling. The results demonstrate that two main factors largely determine OpenFOAM-based WMLES performance. These are the discretization of the convective term and wall modeling. For the former, the best performance in the attached case is achieved with low-dissipation numerics, however, for the smooth body separation case, more dissipative numerics give the best performance. For the latter, we find that both equilibrium and non-equilibrium wall models perform well in the attached case but that the non-equilibrium models significantly improve the prediction of smooth body separation. Still, the non-equilibrium wall model results do not show a uniform improvement over equilibrium models. This is explained by an inconsistent accounting of non-equilibrium physics in these models, i.e., including the pressure gradient term without also including the convective term. This highlights the potential for future performance improvements by using non-equilibrium wall models that consistently account for both the convective and pressure gradient terms.</description>

      <title>Directional focused wave group response of a Floating Wind Turbine: Harmonic separation in experiment and CFD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The offshore wind sector relies on floating foundations for deeper waters but faces challenges from harsh conditions, nonlinear dynamics, and low-frequency resonant motions caused by second-order hydrodynamic loads. We analyze these dynamics and extract higher harmonic motions for a semisubmersible floating foundation under extreme wave conditions using experimental and numerical approaches. Two focused wave groups, with and without spreading, are considered, and experimental data is obtained from scaled physical model tests using phase-shifted input signals for harmonic decomposition of the wave responses. The responses are reproduced numerically using a novel CFD-based rigid body solver, FloatStepper, achieving good agreement. The study quantifies the effects of wave severity, spreading, and steepness on odd and even harmonics of the surge and pitch responses and mooring line tensions. A stronger sea state notably increased odd harmonics in surge and pitch. Additionally, the pitch subharmonic response, less noticeable in milder states, became apparent. Wave spreading influenced the overall response, with pronounced effects on odd and even superharmonic responses. The results reveal a front-back asymmetry in mooring line tensions, with the back lines experiencing greater tension. Increasing wavegroup amplitude caused shifts in subharmonic and superharmonic responses, transitioning from low-frequency surge-dominated behavior to coupled surge-pitch interaction. The cause of this pitch dominance is identified and discussed via CFD.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network Surrogate Model for Multi-Objective Fluid-Acoustic Shape Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate modeling approach for fluid-acoustic shape optimization. The GNN model transforms mesh-based simulations into a computational graph, enabling global prediction of pressure and velocity flow fields around solid boundaries. We employ signed distance functions to implicitly represent geometries on unstructured nodes represented by the graph neural network. The trained graph neural network is employed here to predict the flow field around various airfoil shapes. The median relative error in the prediction of pressure and velocity for 300 test cases is 1-2\%. The predicted flow field is employed to extract the fluid force coefficients and the velocity profile of the boundary layer. The boundary layer velocity profile is then used to predict the flow field and noise levels, allowing the direct integration of the coupled fluid-acoustic analysis in the shape optimization algorithm. The fluid-acoustic shape optimization is extended to multi-objective shape optimization by minimizing trailing edge noise while maximizing the aerodynamic performance of airfoil surfaces. The results show that the overall sound pressure level of the optimized airfoil decreases by 13.9\% (15.82 dBA), and the lift coefficient increases by 7.2\%, for a fixed set of operating conditions. The proposed GNN-based integrated surrogate modeling with the shape optimization algorithm exhibits a computational speed-up of three orders of magnitude compared to while maintaining reasonable accuracy compared to full-order online optimization applications. The GNN-based surrogate model offers an efficient computational framework for fluid-acoustic shape optimization via adaptive morphing of structures.</description>

      <title>An energy-stable phase-field model for droplet icing simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phase-field model for three-phase flows is established by combining the Navier-Stokes (NS) and the energy equations, with the Allen-Cahn (AC) and Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equations and is demonstrated analytically to satisfy the energy dissipation law. A finite difference scheme is then established to discretize the model and this numerical scheme is proved to be unconditionally stable. Based on this scheme, the droplet icing process with phase changing is numerically simulated and the pointy tip of the icy droplet is obtained and analyzed. The influence of the temperature of the supercooled substrate and the ambient air on the droplet freezing process is studied. The results indicate that the formation of the droplet pointy tip is primarily due to the expansion in the vertical direction during the freezing process. Lower substrate temperatures can accelerate this process. Changes in air temperature have a relatively minor impact on the freezing process, mainly affecting its early stages. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the ice front transitions from an approximately horizontal shape to a concave one. Dedicated physical experiments were conducted and the measured solidification process matches the results of the proposed phase-field method very well.</description>

      <title>A mass-conserving contact line treatment for second-order conservative phase field methods based on the generalized Navier boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mass-conserving contact line treatment for second-order conservative phase field methods is presented and applied to the conservative diffuse interface (CDI) model. The treatment centers on a no-flux boundary condition for the phase field along with a slip boundary condition for the velocity that is based on the generalized Navier boundary condition (GNBC). Since the CDI model is a second-order partial differential equation, it does not permit a second (contact angle) boundary condition, in contrast to the popular fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard model. As such, we use one-sided stencils and extrapolations from the interior of the domain to compute phase-field-related quantities on and near the wall. Additionally, we propose novel modifications to the GNBC on the continuous and discrete levels that reduce spurious slip velocity when the contact angle achieves its equilibrium value. The proposed treatment is validated with the equilibrium drop and two-phase Couette flow test cases.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration and dynamics of clamped fibers under finite-amplitude surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of a flexible stem completely submerged under a surface gravity wave of finite amplitude using fully resolved direct numerical simulations. By varying the rigidity of the stem over ten orders of magnitude, we explore its motion in the drag-dominated regime with realistic air and water properties. Our findings reveal two distinct structural responses of the stem depending on the ratio between its natural frequency (f_nat) and the wave frequency (f_wave). For f_nat/f_wave &gt;&gt; 1, the stem maintains on average a straight configuration and exhibits streamwise oscillations in phase-opposition with the wave, moving symmetrically with respect to the vertical direction. Conversely, for f_nat/f_wave &lt;&lt; 1, the stem reconfigures under the influence of the Stokes drift, bending forward and breaking the symmetry, and exhibits oscillations that are more coherent with the surrounding flow field. Resonance is observed when f_nat is approximatively f_wave. These results provide new insights into the dynamics of slender vegetation and man-made structures in wave fields, offering valuable implications for marine biology and engineering.</description>

      <title>Marangoni-driven pattern transition and the formation of ridges and hills in surfactant-covered parametric surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear surface waves are excited via a parametric oscillation of a surfactant-covered interface. Increasing the relative magnitude of the surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses results in a pattern transition from squares (observed for surfactant-free interfaces) to asymmetric squares, weakly wavy stripes, and ridges and hills. These hills are a consequence of the bi-directional Marangoni stresses at the neck of the ridges. The mechanisms underlying the pattern transitions and the formation of exotic ridges and hills are discussed in this Letter.</description>

      <title>Marangoni flow driven hysteresis and azimuthal symmetry breaking in evaporating binary droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-uniform evaporation rate at the liquid-gas interface of binary droplets induces solutal Marangoni flows. In glycerol-water mixtures (positive Marangoni number, where the more volatile fluid has higher surface tension), these flows stabilise into steady patterns. Conversely, in water-ethanol mixtures (negative Marangoni number, where the less volatile fluid has higher surface tension), Marangoni instabilities emerge, producing seemingly chaotic flows. This behaviour arises from the opposing signs of the Marangoni number. Perturbations locally reducing surface tension at the interface drive Marangoni flows away from the perturbed region. Incompressibility enforces a return flow, drawing fluid from the bulk towards the interface. In mixtures with a negative Marangoni number, preferential evaporation of the lower-surface-tension component leads to a higher concentration of the higher-surface-tension component at the interface as compared to the bulk. The return flow therefore creates a positive feedback loop, further reducing surface tension and enhancing the instability. We investigate bistable quasi-stationary solutions in evaporating binary droplets with negative Marangoni numbers and we examine symmetry breaking across a range of Marangoni number and contact angles. Remarkably, droplets with low contact angle show instabilities at lower critical Marangoni numbers than droplets with larger contact angles. Our numerical simulations reveal that interactions between droplet height profiles and non-uniform evaporation rates trigger azimuthal Marangoni instabilities in flat droplets. This geometrically confined instability can even destabilise mixtures with positive Marangoni numbers, particularly for concave liquid-gas interfaces. Finally, through Lyapunov exponent analysis, we confirm the chaotic nature of flows in droplets with a negative Marangoni number.</description>

      <title>AeroDiT: Diffusion Transformers for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulations of Airfoil Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time and accurate prediction of aerodynamic flow fields around airfoils is crucial for flow control and aerodynamic optimization. However, achieving this remains challenging due to the high computational costs and the non-linear nature of flow physics. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods face limitations in balancing computational efficiency and accuracy, hindering their application in real-time scenarios. To address these challenges, this study presents AeroDiT, a novel surrogate model that integrates scalable diffusion models with transformer architectures to address these challenges. Trained on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation data for high Reynolds-number airfoil flows, AeroDiT accurately captures complex flow patterns while enabling real-time predictions. The model demonstrates impressive performance, with average relative L2 errors of 0.1, 0.025, and 0.050 for pressure p and velocity components ux, uy, confirming its reliability. The transformer-based structure allows for real-time predictions within seconds, outperforming traditional U-net diffusion models. This work underscores the potential of generative machine learning techniques to advance computational fluid dynamics, offering potential solutions to persistent challenges in simulating high-fidelity aerodynamic flows.</description>

      <title>Effective transport by 2D turbulence: Vortex-gas intermittency vs. Kraichnan-Leith-Batchelor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kraichnan-Leith-Batchelor (KLB) inverse energy cascade is a hallmark of 2D turbulence, with its theoretical energy spectrum observed in both Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments. Surprisingly, however, we show that the effective diffusivity of 2D turbulent flows significantly departs from the KLB scaling prediction. We illustrate this phenomenon based on a suite of DNS of 2D turbulent flows forced at intermediate wavenumber and damped by weak linear or quadratic drag. We derive alternate scaling predictions based on the emergence of intense, isolated vortices causing spatially intermittent frictional dissipation localized within the small vortex cores. The predictions quantitatively match DNS data. This study points to a universal large-scale organization of 2D turbulent flows in physical space, bridging standard 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence with large-scale geophysical turbulence.</description>

      <title>Effect of time-dependent sinusoidal electric field on the onset of electroconvection in a viscoelastic fluid layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-periodic electric field modulation of a viscoelastic dielectric fluid layer heated from below and cooled from above is examined using an Oldroyd-B type liquid. On the basis of small amplitudes of modulation, the regular perturbation method can be used to calculate the threshold for correction of the critical Rayleigh number. The dielectric constant is assumed to be a linear function of temperature. We show that electric field modulation frequency, electrical, Prandtl number, and viscoelastic parameters are related to the shift in the critical Rayleigh number and the possibility of subcritical convection for low-frequency modulation of the electric field. Rayleigh number, wavenumber, and frequency stability are determined based on free-free isothermal boundary conditions. The dielectrophoretic force is only destabilizing when an electrical field is modulated at a low frequency because it is associated with an unmodulated layer of dielectric fluid. As a result of the stress relaxation parameter in a sinusoidal electric field, the system is destabilized at low frequencies and stabilized at moderate and high frequencies. The effect of strain retardation on mechanical anisotropy is completely opposite. The stability characteristics are illustrated through graphs showing the numerical values of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Although significant advances have been made in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the left atrium (LA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) conditions, the connection between atrial structure, flow dynamics, and blood stagnation in the left atrial appendage (LAA) remains unclear. Deepening our understanding of this connection would have important clinical implications, as the thrombi formed within the LAA are one of the main causes of stroke.
  Aim: To highlight and better understand the fundamental role of the PV orientation in the formation of atrial flow patterns, and quantifying systematically its effect on blood stasis within the LAA.
  Methods: Two patients with different types of atrial flow patterns were selected for the study. The atria were segmented and subsequently morphed to modify the PV orientation in a highly controlled manner. CFD analysis was performed using a kinematic model to reproduce AF conditions. Results were projected into the universal left atrial appendage coordinate (ULAAC) system to enhance data visualization and comparison.
  Results: The position of the main atrial vortex, which governs the atrial flow patterns, is significantly influenced by variations in the PV orientation. Moreover, the flow split ratio affects how the position of the main atrial vortex influences the formation of a stagnant region within the LAA and, thus, the risk of stroke. These findings may have important clinical implications, as standard clinical practice does not take into account PV orientations, flow split ratio, or LA morphology when assessing stroke risk for a particular patient.</description>

Abstract: Hamilton's equations are fundamental for modeling complex physical systems, where preserving key properties such as energy and momentum is crucial for reliable long-term simulations. Geometric integrators are widely used for this purpose, but neural network-based methods that incorporate these principles remain underexplored. This work introduces SympFlow, a time-dependent symplectic neural network designed using parameterized Hamiltonian flow maps. This design allows for backward error analysis and ensures the preservation of the symplectic structure. SympFlow allows for two key applications: (i) providing a time-continuous symplectic approximation of the exact flow of a Hamiltonian system--purely based on the differential equations it satisfies, and (ii) approximating the flow map of an unknown Hamiltonian system relying on trajectory data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SympFlow on diverse problems, including chaotic and dissipative systems, showing improved energy conservation compared to general-purpose numerical methods and accurate</description>

      <title>LLM Agent for Fire Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant advances have been achieved in leveraging foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs), to accelerate complex scientific workflows. In this work we introduce FoamPilot, a proof-of-concept LLM agent designed to enhance the usability of FireFOAM, a specialized solver for fire dynamics and fire suppression simulations built using OpenFOAM, a popular open-source toolbox for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). FoamPilot provides three core functionalities: code insight, case configuration and simulation evaluation. Code insight is an alternative to traditional keyword searching leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and aims to enable efficient navigation and summarization of the FireFOAM source code for developers and experienced users. For case configuration, the agent interprets user requests in natural language and aims to modify existing simulation setups accordingly to support intermediate users. FoamPilot's job execution functionality seeks to manage the submission and execution of simulations in high-performance computing (HPC) environments and provide preliminary analysis of simulation results to support less experienced users. Promising results were achieved for each functionality, particularly for simple tasks, and opportunities were identified for significant further improvement for more complex tasks. The integration of these functionalities into a single LLM agent is a step aimed at accelerating the simulation workflow for engineers and scientists employing FireFOAM for complex simulations critical for improving fire safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing is a promising technology to solve linear partial differential equations that are classically demanding to integrate. It is still challenging to solve non-linear equations in fluid dynamics, such as the Burgers equation, using quantum computers. We propose a novel quantum algorithm to solve the Burgers equation. With the Cole-Hopf transformation that maps the fluid velocity field $u$ to a new field $\psi$, we apply a sequence of quantum gates to solve the resulting linear equation and obtain the quantum state $\vert\psi\rangle$ that encodes the solution $\psi$. We also propose an efficient way to extract stochastic properties of $u$, namely the multi-point functions of $u$, from the quantum state of $\vert\psi\rangle$. Our algorithm offers an exponential advantage over the classical finite difference method in terms of the number of spatial grids when a perturbativity condition in the information-extracting step is met.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To further understand the complex behavior of swimming microorganisms, the spontaneous motion of nonliving matter provides essential insights. While substantial research has focused on quantitatively analyzing complex behavioral patterns, characterizing these dynamics aiming for inclusive comparison to the behavior of living systems remains challenging. In this study, we experimentally and numerically investigated the 'life-like' behavior of an oil droplet in an aqueous surfactant solution by identifying behavioral modes of spontaneous motion patterns in response to varying physical parameters, such as volume and oil concentration. Leveraging data-driven nonparametric dynamical systems analysis, we discovered the low dimensionality and nonlinearity of the underlying dynamical system governing oil droplet motion. Notably, our simulations demonstrate that the two-dimensional Langevin equations effectively reproduce the overall behavior experimentally observed while retaining the rational correspondence with physical parameter interpretations. These findings not only elucidate the fundamental dynamics governing the spontaneous motion of oil droplet systems but also suggest potential pathways for developing more descriptive models that bridge the gap between nonliving and living behaviors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity fluxes in dynamos from rotating inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze direct numerical simulations of large-scale dynamos in inhomogeneous nonhelically-driven rotating turbulence with and without shear. The forcing is modulated so that the turbulent intensity peaks in the middle of the computational box and drops to nearly zero at the two ends above and below the midplane. A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\alpha$ effect of opposite signs between the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the hemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important and can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the $\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously been observed in non-shearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic Reynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent dynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number -- just like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos, where the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it. This suggests that catastrophic dynamo quenching is alleviated by the shear-induced hemispheric small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes that can even overcompensate the fluxes between large and small scales and thereby cause resistive contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we derive a new nonlocal and nonlinear dispersive equations capturing the main dynamics of a circular interface separating a light, viscous fluid rising buoyantly through a heavy, more viscous, miscible fluid at small Reynolds numbers. This equation that we termed the $g-$model shares some common structure with the Camassa-Holm equation but has additional nonlocal effects. For this new PDE we study the well-posedness together with the existence of periodic traveling waves. Furthermore, we also show some numerical simulations suggesting the finite time singularity formation.</description>

      <title>Building transport models from baroclinic wave experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study baroclinic waves both from the experimental and the theoretical perspective. We obtain data from a rotating annulus experiment capable of producing a series of baroclinic eddies similar to those found in the mid-latitude atmosphere. We analyze the experimental outputs using two methods. First, we apply a technique that involves filtering data using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, which is applied to both velocity and surface temperature fields. The second method relies on the construction of a simple kinematic model based on key parameters derived from the experimental data. To analyze eddy-driven fluid transport, we apply the method of Lagrangian descriptors to the underlying velocity field, revealing the attracting material curves that act as transport barriers in the system. These structures effectively capture the essential characteristics of the baroclinic flow and the associated transport phenomena. Our results show that these barriers are in good agreement with the transport patterns observed in the rotating annulus experiment. In particular, we observe that the structures obtained from the kinematic model, or the one derived in terms of filtered velocities, perform well in this regard.</description>

      <title>Structured pathways in the turbulence organizing recent oil spill events in the Eastern Mediterranean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chaotic nature of ocean motion is a major challenge that hinders the discovery of spatio-temporal current routes that govern the transport of material. Certain material, such as oil spills, pose significant environmental threats and these are enhanced by the fact that they evolve in a chaotic sea, in a way which still nowadays is far from being systematically anticipated. Recently such an oil spill event has affected the Mediterranean coast of several Middle Eastern countries. No accidents were reported for these spills previous to their arrival at the coast, and therefore there was no hint of their origin. Modelling such an event, in which uncertainties are increased due to the lack of information on where and when the spills was produced, stretches available technologies to their limits, and requires the use of novel ideas that help to understand the essential features of oil and tar transport by ocean currents. In this regard Lagrangian Coherent Structures enable us to find order within ocean chaos and provide powerful insights into chaotic events and their relationships over different locations and times like the one addressed. Using the observed locations of the oil impacting the coast at specific times, we seek to determine its original location and the time it was released in the open ocean. We have determined both using a combination of earlier satellite observations and computational modelling of the time evolution. The observed agreement between modeled cases and satellite observations highlights the power of these ideas.</description>

Abstract: Vertical motions across the ocean are central to processes, like CO$_2$ fixation, heat removal or pollutant transport, which are essential to the Earth's climate. This work explores 3D conveyor routes {associated with} the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our findings show the geometry of mixing structures in the upper and deep ocean layers by means of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. This tool identifies among others, zones linked to vertical transport and characterizes vertical transport time scales. We focus the study in two regions. The first one is the Flemish Cap region, a zone of interaction between the major AMOC components, where our analysis identifies a domain of deep waters that ascend very rapidly to the ocean surface. The second one is the Irminger Sea, where our analysis confirms the existence of a downwelling zone, and reveals a previously unreported upwelling connection between very deep waters and the ocean surface.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents a study of wakefield generation and electron injection via propagation of radially polarized laser pulses in homogeneous pre-ionized plasma. The analytical study is based on Lorentz force and continuity equations. Perturbation technique and quasi-static approximation are used for evaluating the generated longitudinal wakefields. Trapping and acceleration of electrons are examined by injecting a test electron in the generated wakefields. The results are compared with those obtained via linearly polarized laser pulses. The validation of analytical results is performed using the Fourier-Bessel particle-in-cell (FBPIC) simulation code. It is seen that there is a significant enhancement in amplitude of the longitudinal wakefield generated and electron energy gain via radially polarized laser pulses as compared to linearly polarized laser pulse case.</description>

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is currently used to design and improve the hydraulic properties of biomedical devices, wherein the large scale blood circulation needs to be simulated by accounting for the mechanical response of red blood cells (RBCs) at mesoscales. In many practical instances, biomedical devices work on time-scales comparable to the intrinsic relaxation time of RBCs: thus, a systematic understanding of the time-dependent response of erythrocyte membranes is crucial for the effective design of such devices. So far, this information has been deduced from experimental data, which do not necessarily adapt to the the broad variety of the fluid dynamic conditions that can be encountered in practice. This work explores the novel possibility of studying the time-dependent response of an erythrocyte membrane to external mechanical loads via ab-initio, mesoscale numerical simulations, with a primary focus on the detailed characterisation of the RBC relaxation time $t_c$ following the arrest of the external mechanical load. The adopted mesoscale model exploits a hybrid Immersed Boundary-Lattice Boltzmann Method (IB-LBM), coupled with the Standard Linear Solid model (SLS) to account for the RBC membrane viscosity. We underscore the key importance of the 2D membrane viscosity $\mu_{m}$ to correctly reproduce the relaxation time of the RBC membrane. A detailed assessment of the dependencies on the typology and strength of the applied mechanical loads is also provided. Overall, our findings open interesting future perspectives for the study of the non-linear response of RBCs immersed in time-dependent strain fields.</description>

      <title>A single-domain approach for modeling flow in and around porous media applied to buoyant reacting plume formation and ignition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many processes involve mixed porous-solid fluid domains where fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical reactions interact over disparate length scales, such as the combustion of multi-species solid fuels. Although many studies have concentrated on detailed physics within the fluid or porous phase, few consider both phases, in part due to the challenge in determining suitable boundary conditions between the regions, particularly in turbulent flows where eddies might penetrate the pores. Here, we apply a single-domain approach that eliminates the need for boundary conditions at the interface, and simulate scenarios involving porous solids and a surrounding fluid. Similar to large eddy simulation, the method averages properties over a small spatial volume -- but over the entire domain. We focus on ignition and related interfacial phenomena. After verifying and validating the model, we examine the emission of buoyant reacting plumes from the surface of a heated solid and the near-field flow dynamics. The results indicate flow instabilities similar to Rayleigh--Taylor and Kelvin--Helmholtz phenomena. A combination of viscous and baroclinic torques triggers vorticity generation near the interface and its growth in the surrounding fluid region. Furthermore, we explore the effect of interface morphology, finding that geometrical characteristics such as asymmetry or gap size can alter ignition time and location, or even suppress it. Asymmetry-induced oscillations initially cause negative heat fluxes, which prevent the temperature from reaching the critical level necessary to trigger ignition. These behaviors could significantly influence the mixing of oxidizer and fuel, ignition processes, and fire propagation.</description>

      <title>A unified two-scale gas-liquid multi-fluid model with capillarity and interface regularization through a mass transfer between scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we derive a gas-liquid two-scale multi-fluid model with capillarity effects to enable a novelinterface regularization approach for multi-fluid models. As this unified modelling is capable of switching from theinterface representation of a separated to a disperse regime it lays a new way of modelling regime transitions as itoccurs in atomization processes. Above a preset length threshold at large scale, a multi-fluid diffuse interface modelresolves the dynamics of the interface while, at small-scale, a set of geometric variables is used to characterizethe interface geometry. These variables result from a reduced-order modelling of the small-scale kinetic equationthat describes a collection of liquid inclusions. The flow model can be viewed as a two-phase two-scale mixture,and the equations of motion are obtained thanks to the Hamilton's Stationary Action Principle, which requiresto specify the kinetic and potential energies at play. We particularly focus on modelling the effects of capillarityon the mixture's energy by including dependencies on additional variables accounting for the interface's geometryat both scales. The regularization of the large-scale interface is then introduced as a local and dissipative process.The local curvature is limited via a relaxation toward a modified Laplace equilibrium such that an inter-scalemass transfer is triggered when the mean curvature is too high. We propose an original numerical method andassess the properties and potential of the modelling strategy on the relevant test-case of a two-dimensional liquidcolumn in a compressible gas flow.</description>

Abstract: We find the turbulent energy spectrum of weakly interacting 2D internal gravity waves using the full, non-hydrostatic dispersion relation. This spectrum is an exact solution of a regularized kinetic equation, from which the zero-frequency shear modes have been excised by a careful limiting process. This is a new method in wave kinetic theory. The turbulent spectrum agrees with the 2D oceanic Garrett--Munk spectrum for frequencies large compared to the Coriolis frequency and vertical scales small compared to the depth of the ocean. We show that this turbulent spectrum is the unique power law solution to the steady kinetic equation with a non-zero radial flux. Our solution provides an interesting insight into a turbulent energy cascade in an anisotropic system -- like isotropic turbulence it is self-similar in scale, but its angular part is peaked along the curve of vanishing frequency and is self-similar in frequency.</description>

      <title>Extensions to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier Equations for Rarefied Transport: Variational Multiscale Moment Methods for the Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a fourth order entropy stable extension of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations into the transition regime of rarefied gases. We do this through a novel reformulation of the closure of conservation equations derived from the Boltzmann equation that subsumes existing methods such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion. We apply the linearized version of this extension to the stationary heat problem and the Poiseuille channel and compare our analytical solutions to asymptotic and numerical solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation. In both model problems, our solutions compare remarkably well in the transition regime. For some macroscopic variables, this agreement even extends far beyond the transition regime.</description>

      <title>Mode sensitivity: Connecting Lagrangian coherent structures with modal analysis for fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between modal representations obtained from data-driven decomposition methods and Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs). Mode sensitivity is used to describe this analysis as an extension of the model sensitivity framework developed by Kasz\'as and Haller (2020). The method, based on the computation of the finite-time-Lyapunov exponent, uses modes from fluid data to compute the amplitude perturbations experienced by fluid particle trajectories along with their sensitivity to initial conditions. Demonstrations of the method are presented with both periodic and turbulent flows, including a kinematic flow model, experimental data from the wake past an oscillating foil, numerical data of the classical cylinder wake flow, and a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow. Mode sensitivity fields reveal both quantitatively and qualitatively how the finite-time Lyapunov exponent fields used to visualize LCSs change due to the influence of modes or external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Numerical viscosity and resistivity in MHD turbulence simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review applications of factorization methods to the problem of finding stationary point vortex patterns in two-dimensional fluid mechanics. Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to rational and soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.</description>

      <title>Tunneling in a Lorenz-like model for an active wave-particle entity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active wave-particle entities (WPEs) emerge as self-propelled oil droplets on the free surface of a vibrating oil bath. The particle (droplet) periodically imprints decaying waves on the liquid surface which in turn guide the particle motion, resulting in a two-way coupling between the particle and its self-generated waves. Such WPEs have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of various quantum features. In this work, we theoretically and numerically explore a dynamical analog of tunneling by considering a simple setup of a one-dimensional WPE incident on an isolated Gaussian potential barrier. Our idealized model takes the form of a perturbed Lorenz system which we use to explore the dynamics and statistics of barrier crossing as a function of initial conditions and system parameters. Our work highlights that velocity fluctuations of the WPE at high memories that are rooted in non-equilibrium features of the Lorenz system, such as spiraling motion towards equilibrium points and transient chaos, give rise to - (i) sensitivity and unpredictability in barrier crossing, (ii) smooth variations in transmission probability as a function of system parameters, and (iii) wave-like features in the transmitted and reflected probability density profiles.</description>

      <title>Online learning in idealized ocean gyres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ocean turbulence parameterization has principally been based on processed-based approaches, seeking to embed physical principles so that coarser resolution calculations can capture the net influence of smaller scale unresolved processes. More recently there has been an increasing focus on the application of data-driven approaches to this problem. Here we consider the application of online learning to data-driven eddy parameterization, constructing an end-to-end differentiable dynamical solver forced by a neural network, and training the neural network based on the dynamics of the combined hybrid system. This approach is applied to the classic barotropic Stommel-Munk gyre problem -- a highly idealized configuration which nevertheless includes multiple flow regimes, boundary dynamics, and a separating jet, and therefore presents a challenging test case for the online learning approach. It is found that a neural network which is suitably trained can lead to a coarse resolution neural network parameterized model which is stable, and has both a reasonable mean state and intrinsic variability. This suggests that online learning is a powerful tool for studying the problem of ocean turbulence parameterization.</description>
