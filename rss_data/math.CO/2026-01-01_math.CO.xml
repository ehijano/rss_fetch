      <title>A Discrete Logarithm Construction for Orthogonal Double Covers of the Complete Graph by Hamiltonian Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During their investigation of power-sequence terraces, Anderson and Preece briefly mention a construction of a terrace for the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ when $n$ is odd and $2n+1$ is prime; it is built using the discrete logarithm modulo $2n+1$. In this short note we see that this terrace gives rise to an orthogonal double cover (ODC) for the complete graph $K_n$ by Hamiltonian paths. This gives infinitely many new values for which such an ODC is known.</description>

      <title>Hoffman-London graphs: When paths minimize $H$-colorings among trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a target graph $H$, an $H$-coloring of $G$ is an adjacency-preserving vertex map from $G$ to $H$. The number of $H$-colorings of $G$, $\hom(G,H)$, has been studied for many classes of $G$ and $H$. In particular, extremal questions of maximizing and minimizing $\hom(G,H)$ have been considered when $H$ is a clique or $G$ is a tree.
  In this paper, we develop a new technique using automorphisms of $H$ to show that $\hom(T,H)$ is minimized by paths as $T$ varies over trees on a fixed number of vertices. We introduce the term Hoffman-London to refer to graphs that are minimal in this sense. In particular, we define an automorphic similarity matrix which is used to compute $\hom(T,H)$ and give matrix conditions under which $H$ is Hoffman-London.
  We then apply this technique to identify several families of graphs that are Hoffman-London, including loop threshold graphs and some with applications in statistical physics (e.g. the Widom-Rowlinson model). By combining our approach with a few other observations, we fully characterize the minimizing trees for all graphs $H$ on three or fewer vertices.</description>

      <title>Powers of Hamiltonian cycles in randomly augmented P\'osa-Seymour graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the question of the least number of random edges that need to be added to a P\'osa-Seymour graph, that is, a graph with minimum degree exceeding $\frac k{k+1}n$, to secure the existence of the $m$-th power of a Hamiltonian cycle, $m&gt;k$. It turns out that, depending on $k$ and $m$, this quantity may be captured by two types of thresholds, with one of them, called over-threshold, becoming dominant for large $m$. Indeed, for each $k\ge2$ and $m&gt;m_0(k)$, we establish asymptotically tight lower and upper bounds on the over-thresholds (provided they exist) and show that for infinitely many instances of $m$ the two bounds coincide. In addition, we also determine the thresholds for some small values of $k$ and $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every fixed integer $s$ and every planar graph $H$, the class of $H$-induced-minor-free and $K_{1,s}$-induced-subgraph-free graphs has polylogarithmic tree-independence number. This is a weakening of a conjecture of Dallard, Krnc, Kwon, Milani\v{c}, Munaro, \v{S}torgel, and Wiederrecht.</description>

      <title>Positive specializations of K-theoretic Schur P- and Q-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yeliussizov has classified the positive specializations of symmetric Grothendieck functions, defined in several different ways, providing a K-theoretic lift of the classical Edrei-Thoma theorem. This note studies the analogous classification problem for Ikeda and Naruse's K-theoretic Schur P- and Q-functions, which are the shifted versions of symmetric Grothendieck functions. Our results extend a shifted variant of the Edrei-Thoma theorem due to Nazarov. We also discuss an application to the problem of determining the extreme harmonic functions on a filtered version of the shifted Young lattice.</description>

      <title>A Short Proof that Every Claw-Free Cubic Graph is (1,1,2,2)-Packing Colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently proved that every claw-free cubic graph admits a (1, 1, 2, 2)-packing coloring--that is, its vertex set can be partitioned into two 1-packings and two 2-packings. This result was established by Bre\v{s}ar, Kuenzel, and Rall [Discrete Mathematics 348 (8) (2025), 114477]. In this paper, we provide a simpler and shorter proof.</description>

      <title>On the finiteness of the group associated with weighted walks in multidimensional orthants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of walks with small steps confined to multidimensional orthants, a certain group of transformations plays a central role. In particular, several techniques to potentially compute the generating function, including the orbit sum method, can only be applied when this group is finite. In this note, we present three new results concerning this group. First, in two dimensions, we provide a complete characterization of the weight parameters that yield a finite group. In higher dimensions, we show that whenever the group is finite, it must necessarily be isomorphic to a simpler reflection group. Finally, in dimension three, we give a full classification of the parameters leading to a finite group that also satisfies an additional Weyl property.</description>

      <title>Notes on the 33-point Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of $ES(7)$ is the first open case of the planar Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem, where the general conjecture predicts $ES(7)=33$. We present a SAT encoding for the 33-point case based on triple-orientation variables and a 4-set convexity criterion for excluding convex 7-gons, together with convex-layer anchoring constraints. The framework yields UNSAT certificates for a collection of anchored subfamilies. We also report pronounced runtime variability across configurations, including heavy-tailed behavior that currently dominates the computational effort and motivates further encoding refinements.</description>

      <title>Dominion of some graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph G equals (V,E), a subset S subset of V is a dominating set if every vertex in V minus S is adjacent to some vertex in S. The dominating set with the least cardinality, gamma, is called a gamma-set which is commonly known as a minimum dominating set. The dominion of a graph G, denoted by zeta(G), is the number of its gamma-sets. Some relations between these two seemingly distinct parameters are established. In particular, we present the dominions of paths, some cycles and the join of any two graphs.</description>

      <title>Node-Kayles on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node-Kayles is a well-known impartial combinatorial game played on graphs, where players alternately select a vertex and remove it along with its neighbors. By the Sprague-Grundy theorem, every position of an impartial game corresponds to a non-negative integer called its Grundy value. In this paper, we investigate the Grundy value sequences of $n$-regular trees as well as graphs formed by joining two $n$-regular trees with a path of length $k$. We derive explicit formulas and recursive relations for the associated Grundy value sequences. Furthermore, we prove that these sequences are eventually periodic and determine both their preperiod lengths and their periods.</description>

      <title>Spanning Components and Surfaces Under Minimum Vertex Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimum vertex-degree conditions in 3-uniform hypergraphs for (tight) spanning components and (combinatorial) surfaces. Our main results show that a 3-uniform hypergraph $G$ on $n$ vertices contains a spanning component if $\delta_1(G) \gtrsim \tfrac{1}{2} \binom{n}{2}$ and a spanning copy of any surface if $\delta_1(G) \gtrsim \tfrac{5}{9} \binom{n}{2}$, which in both cases is asymptotically optimal. This extends the work of Georgakopoulos, Haslegrave, Montgomery, and Narayanan who determined the corresponding minimum codegree conditions in this setting.</description>

      <title>On the Consistency of Combinatorially Symmetric Sign Patterns and the Class of 2-Consistent Sign Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sign pattern is a matrix that has entries from the set $\{+,-,0\}$. An $n\times n$ sign pattern $\mathcal{P}$ is called consistent if every real matrix in its qualitative class has exactly $k$ real eigenvalues and $n-k$ nonreal eigenvalues for some integer $k$, with $1\leq k\leq n$. In the article \cite{1}, the authors established a necessary condition for irreducible, tridiagonal patterns with a $0$-diagonal to be consistent. Subsequently, they proposed that this condition is also sufficient for such patterns to be consistent. In this article, we first demonstrate that this proposition does not hold. We characterize all irreducible, tridiagonal sign patterns with a $0$-diagonal of order at most five that are consistent. Moreover, we establish useful, necessary conditions for irreducible, combinatorially symmetric sign patterns to be consistent. Finally, we introduce the class $\Delta$ of all $2$-consistent sign patterns and provide several necessary conditions for sign patterns to belong to this class.</description>

      <title>Simple factor graphs associated with split graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a loopless multigraph associated with a split graph $S$: the factor graph of $S$, denoted by $\Phi(S)$, which encodes the combinatorial information about 2-switch transformations over $S$. This construction provides a cleaner, compact and non-redundant alternative to the graph $A_4(S)$ by Barrus and West, for the particular case of split graphs. If $\Phi(S)$ is simple and connected, we obtain a precise description of the underlying structure of $S$, particularly when $\Phi(S)$ is complete, highlighting the usefulness of the factor graph for understanding 2-switch dynamics in balanced and indecomposable split graphs, as well as its 2-switch-degree classification.</description>

      <title>Construction of sign k-potent sign patterns and conditions for such sign patterns to allow k-potence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sign pattern is a matrix whose entries are from the set $\{+,-, 0\}$. A square sign pattern $A$ is called sign $k$-potent if $k$ is the smallest positive integer for which $A^{k+1}=A$, and for $k=1$, $A$ is called sign idempotent. In 1993, Eschenbach \cite{01} gave an algorithm to construct sign idempotent sign patterns. However, Huang \cite{02} constructed an example to show that matrices obtained by Eschenbach's algorithm were not necessarily sign idempotent. In \cite{03}, Park and Pyo modified Eschenbach's algorithm to construct all reducible sign idempotent sign patterns. In this paper, we give an example to establish that the modified algorithm by Park and Pyo does not always terminate in a single iteration; the number of iterations, depending on the order of the sign pattern, could be large. In this paper, we give a new algorithm that terminates in a single iteration to construct all possible sign idempotent sign patterns. We also provide an algorithm for constructing sign $k$-potent sign patterns. Further, we give some necessary and sufficient conditions for a sign $k$-potent sign pattern to allow $k$-potence.</description>

      <title>On maximum distance separable and completely regular codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate when a maximum distance separable ($MDS$) code over $F_q$ is also completely regular ($CR$). For lengths $n=q+1$ and $n=q+2$ we provide a complete classification of the $MDS$ codes that are $CR$ or at least uniformly packed in the wide sense ($UPWS$). For the more restricted case $n\leq q$ with $q\leq 5$ we obtain a full classification (up to equivalence) of all nontrivial $MDS$ codes: there are none for $q=2$; only the ternary Hamming code for $q=3$; four nontrivial families for $q=4$; and exactly six linear $MDS$ codes for $q=5$ (three of which are $CR$ and one admits a self-dual version). Additionally, we close two gaps left open in a previous classification of self-dual $CR$ codes with covering radius $\rho\leq 3$: we precisely determine over which finite fields the $MDS$ self-dual completely regular codes with parameters $[2,1,2]_q$ and $[4,2,3]_q$ exist.</description>

      <title>Quasi Neighborhood Balanced Coloring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph G = (V, E), a coloring of vertices of G using two colors, say red and blue, is called a quasi neighborhood balanced coloring if, for every vertex of the graph, the number of red neighbors and the number of blue neighbors differ by at most one. In addition, there must be at least one vertex in G for which this difference is exactly one. If a graph G admits such a colouring, then G is said to be a quasi-neighbourhood balanced colored graph. We also define variants of such a coloring, like uniform quasi neighborhood balanced coloring, positive quasi neighborhood balanced coloring and negative quasi neighborhood balanced coloring based on the color of the extra neighbor of every vertex of odd degree of the graph G. We present several examples of graph classes that admit the various variants of quasi neighborhood balanced coloring. We also discuss various graph operations involving such graphs. Furthermore, we prove that there is no forbidden subgraph characterization for the class of quasi neighborhood balanced coloring and show that the problem of determining whether a given graph has such a coloring is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>The $k$-Plancherel measure and a Finite Markov Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}_k(n)$ denote the set of partitions of $n$ whose largest part is bounded by $k,$ which are in well-known bijection with $(k+1)$-cores $\mathcal{C}_k$. We study a growth process on $\mathcal{C}_k$, whose stationary distribution is the $k$-Plancherel measure, which is a natural extension of the Plancherel measure in the context of $k$-Schur functions. When $k\to\infty$ it converges to the Plancherel measure for partitions, a limit studied first by Vershik-Kerov. However, when $k$ is fixed and $n\to \infty$, we conjecture that it converges to a shape close to the limit shape from the uniform growth of partitions, as studied by Rost. We show that the limiting behavior, for fixed $k$, is governed by a finite Markov chain with $k!$ states over a subset of the $k$-bounded partitions or equivalently as a TASEP over cyclic permutations of length $k+1$. This paper initiates the study of these processes, state some theorems and several intriguing conjectures found by computations of the finite Markov chain.</description>

      <title>Permutations with only reduced co-BPDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bumpless pipe dreams (BPDs) are combinatorial objects used in the study of Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials. Weigandt recently introduced a co-BPD object associated to each BPD and used them to give an analogue to the change of bases formulas of Lenart and Lascoux between these polynomials. She posed the problem of characterizing the set of permutations whose BPDs have only reduced co-BPDs. We give a pattern-avoidance characterization for these permutations using a set of seven patterns.</description>

      <title>The non-backtracking transition probability matrix and its usage for node clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relation between the real eigenvalues of the non-backtracking matrix and those of the non-backtracking Laplacian is considered with respect to node clustering. For this purpose we use the real eigenvalues of the transition probability matrix (when the random walk goes through the oriented edges with the rule of ``not going back in the next step'') which have a linear relation to those of the non-backtracking Laplacian of Jost,Mulas. ``Inflation--deflation'' techniques are also developed for clustering the nodes of the non-backtracking graph. With further processing, it leads to the clustering of the nodes of the original graph, which usually comes from a sparse stochastic block model of Bordenave,Decelle.</description>

      <title>Skein relations on punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis studies skein relations in cluster algebras arising from punctured surfaces. We introduce skein-type identities expressing cluster variables associated with incompatible curves on a surface in terms of cluster variables corresponding to compatible arcs. Incompatibility arises from phenomena such as intersections, self-intersections, and opposite taggings at punctures. To establish these identities, we develop a combinatorial-algebraic framework that relates loop graphs to certain representations. These skein relations can then be applied to investigate structural properties of cluster algebras from punctured surfaces. In particular, they can be used to prove the existence of bases satisfying natural positivity and compatibility conditions. This extends existing work on surface cluster algebras by incorporating punctures in the interior of the surface, thereby enlarging the class of cluster algebras for which such skein relations and bases can be constructed.</description>

      <title>The square of a subcubic planar graph without a 5-cycle is 7-choosable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The square of a graph $G$, denoted $G^2$, has the same vertex set as $G$ and has an edge between two vertices if the distance between them in $G$ is at most $2$. Thomassen [12] showed that $\chi(G^2) \leq 7$ if $G$ is a subcubic planar graph. A natural question is whether $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) \leq 7$ or not if $G$ is a subcubic planar graph. Recently Kim and Lian [11] showed that $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) \leq 7$ if $G$ is a subcubic planar graph of girth at least 6. And Jin, Kang, and Kim [10] showed that $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) \leq 7$ if $G$ is a subcubic planar graph without 4-cycles and 5-cycles. In this paper, we show that the square of a subcubic planar graph without 5-cycles is 7-choosable, which improves the results of [10] and [11].</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms between Covering-Induced Lattices and Classical Geometric Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattices induced by coverings arise naturally in matroid theory and combinatorial optimization, providing a structured framework for analyzing relationships between independent sets and closures. In this paper, we explore the structural properties of such lattices, with a particular focus on their rank structure, covering relations, and enumeration of elements per level. Leveraging these structural insights, we investigate necessary and sufficient conditions under which the lattice induced by a covering is isomorphic to classical geometric lattices, including the lattice of partitions, the lattice of subspaces of a vector space over a finite field, and the Dowling lattice. Our results provide a unified framework for comparing these combinatorial structures and contribute to the broader study of lattice theory, matroids, and their applications in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>On Circular Threshold Words and Other Stronger Versions of Dejean's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let the root of the word $w$ be the smallest prefix $v$ of $w$ such that $w$ is a prefix of $vvv...$. $per(w)$ is the length of the root of $w$. For any $n\ge5$, an $n$-ary threshold word is a word $w$ such that for any factor (subword) $v$ of $w$ the condition $\frac{|v|}{per(v)}\le\frac{n}{n-1}$ holds. Dejean conjecture (completely proven in 2009) states for $n\ge5$ that exists infinitely many of $n$-ary TWs.
  This manuscript is based on the author's student works (diplomas of 2011 (bachelor's thesis) and 2013 (master's thesis) years) and presents an edited version (in Russian) of these works with some improvements.
  In a 2011 work proposed new methods of proving of the Dejean conjecture for some odd cases $n\ge5$, using computer verification in polynomial time (depending on $n$). Moreover, the constructed threshold words (TWs) are ciclic/ring TWs (any cyclic shift is a TW).
  In the 2013 work, the proof method (of 2011) was improved by reducing the verification conditions. A solution for some even cases $n\ge6$ is also proposed. A 2013 work also proposed a method to construct stronger TWs, using a TW tree with regular exponential growth. Namely, the TWs, where all long factors have an exponent close to 1.</description>

      <title>On the number of pairwise touching cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: John E. Littlewood posted the question {\em ``Is it possible in 3-space for seven infinite circular cylinders of unit radius each to touch all the others? Seven is the number suggested by counting constants.''} Boz\'oki, Lee, and R\'onyai constructed a configuration of 7 mutually touching unit cylinders. The best-known upper bounds show that at most 10 unit cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can mutually touch. We consider this problem in higher dimensions, and obtain exponential (in $d$) upper bounds on the number of mutually touching cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our method is fairly flexible, and it makes use of the fact that cylinder touching can be expressed as a combination of polynomial equalities and non-equalities.</description>

      <title>A categorical proof of the nonexistence of (120, 35, 10)-difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A difference set with parameters $(v, k, \lambda)$ is a subset $D$ of cardinality $k$ in a finite group $G$ of order $v$, such that the number $\lambda$ of occurrences of $g \in G$ as the ratio $d^{-1}d'$ in distinct pairs $(d, d')\in D\times D$ is independent of $g$. We prove the nonexistence of $(120, 35, 10)$-difference sets, which has been an open problem for 70 years since Bruck introduced the notion of nonabelian difference sets.
  Our main tools are 1. a generalization of the category of finite groups to that of association schemes (actually, to that of relation partitions), 2. a generalization of difference sets to equi-distributed functions and its preservation by pushouts along quotients, 3. reduction to a linear programming in the nonnegative integer lattice with quadratic constraints.</description>

      <title>Small 3-fold blocking sets in $\mathrm{PG}(2,p^n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $t$-fold blocking set of the finite Desarguesian plane $\mathrm{PG}(2,p^n)$, $p$ prime, is a set of points meeting each line of the plane in at least $t$ points. The minimum size of such sets is of interest for numerous reasons; however, even the minimum size of nontrivial blocking sets (i.e. $1$-fold blocking sets not containing a line) in \(\mathrm{PG}(2,p^n)\) is an open question when $n\geq 5$ is odd. For $n&gt;1$ the conjectured lower bound for this size is $(p^n+p^{n(s-1)/s}+1)$, where $p^{n/s}$ is the size of the largest proper subfield of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. Since the union of $t$ pairwise disjoint nontrivial blocking sets is a $t$-fold blocking set, it is conjectured that when $p^{n/s}$ is large enough w.r.t. $t$, then the minimum size of a $t$-fold blocking set in $\mathrm{PG}(2,p^n)$ is $t(p^n+p^{n(s-1)/s}+1)$. If $n$ is even, then the decomposition of the plane into disjoint Baer subplanes gives a $t$-fold blocking set of this size. However, for odd $n$, the existence of such sets is an unsolved problem in most cases.
  In this paper, we construct $3$-fold blocking sets of conjectured size. These blocking sets are obtained as the disjoint union of three linear blocking sets of R\'edei type, and they lie on the same orbit of the projectivity $(x:y:z)\mapsto (z:x:y)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the maximum number $e_d(n)$ of pairs of touching circles in a packing of $n$ congruent circles of diameter $d$ in the hyperbolic plane of curvature $-1$. In the Euclidean plane, the maximum comes from a spiral construction of the tiling of the plane with equilateral triangles (Harborth 1974), with a similar result in the hyperbolic plane for the values of $d$ corresponding to the order-$k$ triangular tilings (Bowen 2000). We present various upper and lower bounds for $e_d(n)$ for all values of $d &gt; 0$. In particular, we prove that if $d &gt; 0.66114\dots$ except for $d=0.76217\dots$, then the number of touching pairs is less than the one coming from a spiral construction in the order-$7$ triangular tiling, which we conjecture to be extremal. We also give a lower bound $e_d(n) &gt; (2+\varepsilon_d)n$ where $\varepsilon_d &gt; 1$ for all $d &gt; 0$.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ factors into graphs $H$ and $K$ via a matrix product if $A = BC$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the adjacency matrices of $G$, $H$, and $K$, respectively. The graph $G$ is prime if, in every such factorization, one of the factors is a perfect matching that is, it corresponds to a permutation matrix. We characterize all prime graphs, then using this result we classify all factorable forests, answering a question of Akbari et al. [\emph{Linear Algebra and its Applications} (2025)]. We prove that every torus is factorable, and we characterize all possible factorizations of grids, addressing two questions posed by Maghsoudi et al. [\emph{Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics} (2025)].</description>

Abstract: We obtain some $d\ge2$ such that every graph $G$ with no induced copy of the five-vertex path $P_5$ has chromatic number at most $\omega(G)^d$, thereby resolving an open problem of Gy\'arf\'as from 1985. The proof consists of three main ingredients:
  $\bullet$ an analogue of R\"odl's theorem for the chromatic number of $P_5$-free graphs, proved via the ``Gy\'arf\'as path'' argument;
  $\bullet$ a decomposition argument for $P_5$-free graphs that allows one to grow high-chromatic anticomplete pairs indefinitely or to capture a polynomially chromatic-dense induced subgraph; and
  $\bullet$ a ``chromatic density increment'' argument that uses the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal result for $P_5$ as a black box.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similarity notions between vertices in a graph, such as structural and regular equivalence, are one of the main ingredients in clustering tools in complex network science. We generalise structural and regular equivalences for undirected hypergraphs and provide a characterisation of structural and regular equivalences of undirected graphs and hypergraphs through neighbourhood graphs and Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Our characterisation sheds new light on these similarity notions opening a new avenue for their exploration. These characterisations also enable the construction of a possibly wide family of regular partitions, thereby offering a new route to a task that has so far been computationally challenging.</description>

      <title>Universal polar dual pairs of spherical codes found in $E_8$ and $\Lambda_{24}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify universal polar dual pairs of spherical codes $C$ and $D$ such that for a large class of potential functions $h$ the minima of the discrete $h$-potential of $C$ on the sphere occur at the points of $D$ and vice versa. Moreover, the minimal values of their normalized potentials are equal. These codes arise from the known sharp codes embedded in the even unimodular extremal lattices $E_8$ and $\Lambda_{24}$ (Leech lattice). This embedding allows us to use the lattices' properties to find new universal polar dual pairs. In the process we extensively utilize the interplay between the binary Golay codes and the Leech lattice.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we identify a new universally optimal (in the sense of energy) code in the projective space $\mathbb{RP}^{21}$ with $1408$ points (lines). Furthermore, we extend the Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel definition of derived codes from their seminal $1977$ paper and generalize their Theorem 8.2 to show that if a $\tau$-design is enclosed in $k\leq \tau$ parallel hyperplanes, then each of the hyperplane's sub-code is a $(\tau+1-k)$-design in the ambient subspace.</description>

Abstract: Given a m-dimensional Gaussian process and polynomial m variables with real coefficients, we calculate the induced path odered exponenial in two different ways: one is purely algebraic in spirit and the other one is diagrammatic in spirit and uses multigraph labelings (and is inspired by the use of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory).</description>

      <title>Tropical methods for building real space sextics with totally real tritangent planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the use of combinatorial techniques from tropical geometry to build the 120 tritangent planes to a given smooth algebraic space sextic. Although the tropical count is infinite, tropical tritangents come in 15 equivalence classes, each containing the tropicalization of exactly eight classical tritangents.
  Under mild genericity conditions on the tropical side, we show that liftings of tropical tritangents are defined over quadratic extensions of the ground field over which the input sextic curve is defined. When the input curve is real, we prove that every complex liftable member of a given tropical tritangent class either completely lifts to the reals or none of its liftings are defined over the reals. As our main application we use these methods to build examples of real space sextics with 64 and 120 totally real tritangents, respectively. The paper concludes with a discussion of our results in the arithmetic setting.</description>

      <title>Functional Calculi, Positivity, and Convolution of Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolution admits a natural formulation as a functional operation on matrices. Motivated by the functional and entrywise calculi, this leads to a framework in which convolution defines a matrix transform that preserves positivity. Within this setting, we establish results parallel to the classical theories of P\'olya--Szeg\H{o}, Schoenberg, Rudin, Loewner, and Horn in the context of entrywise calculus. The structure of our transform is governed by a Cayley--Hamilton-type theory valid in commutative rings of characteristic zero, together with a novel polynomial-matrix identity specific to convolution. Beyond these analytic aspects, we uncover an intrinsic connection between convolution and the Bruhat order on the symmetric group, illuminating the combinatorial aspect of this functional operation. This work extends the classical theory of entrywise positivity preservers and operator monotone functions into the convolutional setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study combinatorial aspects of reduced plane curves known as $\mathscr{M}$-curves. This notation is a natural generalization of maximizing plane curves which are well-known in the theory of algebraic surfaces. We focus here on $\mathscr{M}$-arrangements of conics and lines with ordinary singularities of multiplicity less than five and we provide various numerical constraints on their existence, particularly in terms of their weak combinatorics. Moreover, we study in detail the scenario when our $\mathscr{M}$-arrangements consist of lines and just one conic.</description>

      <title>Twisted Cherednik systems and non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider eigenfunctions of many-body system Hamiltonians associated with generalized (a-twisted) Cherednik operators used in construction of other Hamiltonians: those arising from commutative subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. The simplest example of these eigenfunctions is provided by non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, while generally they are constructed basing on the ground state eigenfunction coinciding with the twisted Baker-Akhiezer function being a peculiar (symmetric) eigenfunction of the DIM Hamiltonians. Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This gives a new twist in theory of integrable systems, which usually puts an accent on symmetric polynomials, and provides a new dimension to the {\it triad} made from the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, untwisted Baker-Akhiezer functions and Noumi-Shiraishi series.</description>

      <title>On an Erd\H{o}s--Lov'asz problem: 3-critical 3-graphs of minimum degree 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Lov'asz asked whether there exists a "3-critical" 3-uniform hypergraph in which every vertex has degree at least 7. The original formulation does not specify what 3-critical means, and two non-equivalent notions have appeared in the literature and in later discussions of the problem. In this paper we resolve the question under both interpretations. For the transversal interpretation (criticality with respect to the transversal number), we prove that a 3-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $\tau(H)=3$ and $\tau(H-e)=2$ for every edge $e$ has at most 10 edges; in particular, $\delta(H)\le 6$, and this bound is sharp, witnessed by the complete 3-graph $K^{(3)}_5$. For the chromatic interpretation (criticality with respect to weak vertex-colourings), we give an explicit 3-uniform hypergraph on 9 vertices with $\chi(H)=3$ and minimum degree $\delta(H)=7$ such that deleting any single edge or any single vertex makes it 2-colourable. The criticality of the example is certified by explicit witness 2-colourings listed in the appendices, together with a short verification script.</description>

      <title>The local limit of weighted spanning trees on balanced networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the local limit of the weighted spanning trees on any simple connected high degree almost regular sequence of electric networks is the Poisson(1) branching process conditioned to survive forever, by generalizing [NP22] and closing a gap in their proof. We also study the local statistics of the WST's on high degree almost balanced sequences, which is interesting even for the uniform spanning trees.
  Our motivation comes from studying an interpolation $\{\mathsf{WST}^{\beta}(G)\}_{\beta\in [0, \infty)}$ between UST(G) and MST(G) by WST's on a one-parameter family of random environments. This model has recently been introduced in [MSS24, K\'us24], and the phases of several properties have been determined on the complete graphs.
  We show a phase transition of $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(G_n)$ regarding the local limit and expected edge overlaps for high degree almost balanced graph sequences $G_n$, without any structural assumptions on the graphs; while the expected total length is sensitive to the global structure of the graphs. Our general framework results in a better understanding even in the case of complete graphs, where it narrows the window of the phase transition of [Mak24].</description>

      <title>Grassmannian Geometries for Non-Planar On-Shell Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-shell diagrams are gauge invariant quantities which play an important role in the description of scattering amplitudes. Based on the principles of generalized unitarity, they are given by products of elementary three-point amplitudes where the kinematics of internal on-shell legs are determined by cut conditions. In the ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, the dual formulation for on-shell diagrams produces the same quantities as canonical forms on the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$. Most of the work in this direction has been devoted to the planar diagrams, which dominate in the large $N$ limit of gauge theories. On the mathematical side, planar on-shell diagrams correspond to cells of the positive Grassmannian $G_+(k,n)$ which have been very extensively studied in the literature in the past 20 years. In this paper, we focus on the non-planar on-shell diagrams which are relevant at finite $N$. In particular, we use the triplet formulation of Maximal-Helicity-Violating (MHV) on-shell diagrams to obtain certain regions in the Grassmannian $G(2,n)$. These regions are unions of positive Grassmannians with different orderings (referred to as oriented regions). We explore the features of these unions, and show that they are pseudo-positive geometries, in contrast to positive geometry of a single oriented region. For all non-planar diagrams which are \emph{internally planar} there always exists a strongly connected geometry, and for those that are \emph{irreducible}, there exists a geometry with no spurious facets. We also prove that the already known identity moves, square and sphere moves, form the complete set of identity moves for all MHV on-shell diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fixed point biased involutions that avoid a pattern. For every pattern of length three we obtain limit theorems for the asymptotic distribution of the (appropriately centered and scaled) number of fixed points of a random fixed point biased involution avoiding that pattern. When the pattern being avoided is either $321$, $132$, or $213$, we find a phase transition depending on the strength of the bias. We also obtain a limit theorem for distribution of fixed points when the pattern is $123\cdots k(k+1)$ for any $k$ and partial results when the pattern is $(k+1)k\cdots 321$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a discrete theory of real Riemann surfaces based on quadrilateral cellular decompositions (quad-graphs) and a linear discretization of the Cauchy-Riemann equations. We construct a discrete analogue of an antiholomorphic involution and classify the topological types of discrete real Riemann surfaces, recovering the classical results on the number of real ovals and the separation of the surface.
  Central to our approach is the construction of a symplectic homology basis adapted to the discrete involution. Using this basis, we prove that the discrete period matrix admits the same canonical decomposition $\Pi = \frac{1}{2} H + i T$ as in the smooth setting, where $H$ encodes the topological type and $T$ is purely imaginary. This structural result bridges the gap between combinatorial models and the classical theory of real algebraic curves.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the partition properties of roller coaster permutations, a class of permutations characterized by maximizing the number of alternating runs in all subsequences. We establish a connection between the structure of these permutations and their partition numbers, defined as the minimum number of monotonic subsequences required to cover the permutation. Our main result provides a theoretical upper bound for the partition number of a roller coaster permutation of length $n$, given by $P_{max}(n) \le \lfloor\frac{\lceil\frac{n-2}{2}\rceil}{2}\rfloor + 2$. We further present experimental data for $n &lt; 15$ that suggests this bound is nearly sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $P$ a poset, the dimension of $P$ is defined to be the least cardinal $\kappa$ such that $P$ is embeddable in a direct product of $\kappa$ totally ordered sets. We study the behavior of this function on finite-dimensional (not necessarily finite) posets.
  In general, the dimension dim($P$ x $Q$) of a product of two posets can be smaller than dim($P$) + dim($Q$), though no cases are known where the discrepancy is greater than 2. We obtain a result that gives upper bounds on the dimensions of certain products of posets, including cases where the discrepancy 2 is achieved. But the paper is mainly devoted to stating questions, old and new, about dimensions of product posets, noting implications among their possible answers, and introducing some related concepts that might be helpful in tackling these questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A factorisation problem in the symmetric group is central if conjugate permutations always have the same number of factorisations. We give the first fully combinatorial proof of the centrality of transitive star factorisations that is valid in all genera, which answers a natural question of Goulden and Jackson from 2009. We begin by showing that the set of star factorisations is equinumerous with a certain set of monotone factorisations, a new result. We give more than one proof of this, and, crucially, one of our proofs is bijective. As a corollary we obtain new formulae for some monotone double Hurwitz factorisations, and a new relation between Hurwitz and monotone Hurwitz factorisations. We also generalise a theorem of Goulden and Jackson from 2009 that states that the transitive power of Jucys-Murphy elements are central. Our theorem states that the transitive image of any symmetric function evaluated at Jucys-Murphy elements is central, which gives a transitive version of Jucys' original result from 1974.</description>

Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a graph and $L$ is a list assignment for $G$. A request of $L$ is a function $r$ with nonempty domain $D\subseteq V(G)$ such that $r(v) \in L(v)$ for each $v \in D$. The triple $(G,L,r)$ is $\epsilon$-satisfiable if there exists a proper $L$-coloring $f$ of $G$ such that $f(v) = r(v)$ for at least $\epsilon|D|$ vertices in $D$. We say $G$ is $(k, \epsilon)$-flexible if $(G,L',r')$ is $\epsilon$-satisfiable whenever $L'$ is a $k$-assignment for $G$ and $r'$ is a request of $L'$. It is known that a graph $G$ is not $(k, \epsilon)$-flexible for any $k$ if and only if $\epsilon &gt; 1/ \rho(G)$ where $\rho(G)$ is the Hall ratio of $G$. The list flexibility number of a graph $G$, denoted $\chi_{\ell flex}(G)$, is the smallest $k$ such that $G$ is $(k,1/ \rho(G))$-flexible. A fundamental open question on list flexibility numbers asks: Is there a graph with list flexibility number greater than its coloring number?
  In this paper, we show that the list flexibility number of any complete multipartite graph $G$ is at most the coloring number of $G$. We also initiate the study of list epsilon flexibility functions of complete bipartite graphs which was first suggested by Kaul, Mathew, Mudrock, and Pelsmajer in 2024. Specifically, we completely determine the list epsilon flexibility function of $K_{m,n}$ when $m \in \{1,2\}$ and establish some additional bounds for small $m$. Our proofs reveal a connection to list coloring complete bipartite graphs with asymmetric list sizes which is a topic that was explored by Alon, Cambie, and Kang in 2021.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript introduces Diophantine labeling, a new way of labeling of the vertices for finite simple undirected graphs with some divisibility condition on the edges. Maximal graphs admitting Diophantine labeling are investigated and their number of edges are computed. Some number-theoretic techniques are used to characterize vertices of maximum degree and nonadjacent vertices. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for vertices of equal degrees are found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every sufficiently large oriented graph $G$ with minimum indegree and outdegree both at least $(3|V(G)|-1)/8$ contains every orientation of a Hamilton cycle. This result improves the approximate bound established by Kelly and resolves a long-standing problem posed by H\"aggkvist and Thomason in 1995. The degree condition is tight and it can be improved to $(3|V(G)|-4)/8$ for Hamilton cycles that are nearly directed, generalizing a classic result by Keevash, K\"uhn and Osthus. Additionally, we derive a pancyclicity result for arbitrary orientations. More precisely, the above degree condition suffices to guarantee the existence of cycles of every possible orientation and every possible length unless $G$ is isomorphic to one of the exceptional oriented graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connections between structural graph theory and finite model theory recently gained a lot of attention. In this setting, many interesting questions remain on the properties of dependent (NIP) hereditary classes of graphs, in particular related to first-order transductions. In this paper, we study modelizations (which are strong forms of transduction pairings) of classes of graphs by classes of structures. In particular, we consider models obtained by coupling a partial order and a colored graph (thus forming a partially ordered colored graph). Motivated by Simon's decomposition theorem of dependent types into a stable part and a distal (order-like) part, we conjecture that every dependent hereditary class of graphs admits a modelization in a monadically dependent coupling of a class of posets with bounded treewidth cover graphs and a monadically stable class of colored graphs. In this paper, we consider the first non-trivial case (classes with bounded linear cliquewidth) and prove that the conjecture holds in a strong form, the model class being a monadically dependent coupling of a class of disjoint unions of chains and a class of colored graphs with bounded pathwidth. We extend our study to classes that admit bounded-size bounded linear cliquewidth decompositions and prove that they have a modelization in a monadically dependent coupling of a class of disjoint unions of chains and a class of colored graphs with bounded expansion, the model class also admitting bounded-size bounded linear cliquewidth decompositions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper various Steiner systems $S(2,k,v)$ for $k = 6$ are collected and enumerated for specific constructions. In particular, two earlier unknown types of $1$-rotational designs are found for the groups $SL(2,5)$ and $((\mathbb Z_3 \times \mathbb Z_3) \rtimes \mathbb Z_3) \times \mathbb Z_5$. Also new Steiner systems $S(2,6,96), S(2,6,106), S(2,6,111)$ are listed.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing graphs and their connectivity using graphlets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphlets are subgraphs rooted at a fixed vertex. The number of occurrences of graphlets aligned to a particular vertex, called graphlet degree sequence (gds), gives a topological description of the surrounding of the analyzed vertex. Graphlet degree distribution (gdd) of a graph is a matrix containing graphlet degree sequence for all vertices in the given graph. A long standing open problem called reconstruction conjecture (RC) asks whether the structure of a graph is uniquely determined by the multiset of its vertex-deleted subgraphs. Graphlet degree distribution up to size (n - 1), (&lt;= n - 1)-gdd, gives more information to reconstruct the graph and we use it to reconstruct any graph having a unique almost-asymmetric vertex-deleted subgraph, where almost-asymmetric means that at most one automorphism orbit has size larger than one. Moreover, we prove that any graph containing a vertex-cut of size 1 or any graph of order n having a vertex with degree at most 2 or at least n-2 is reconstructible from its (&lt;= n - 1)-gdd, which expands results shown in the standard RC. We also discuss the relation between gdd and graph connectivity and the conditions on (&lt;= 3)-gdd, whose breaking means that no graph with such gdd exists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Raimi's theorem guarantees the existence of a partition of $\mathbb{N}$ into two parts with an unavoidable intersection property: for any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, some color class intersects both parts infinitely many times, after an appropriate shift (translation). We establish a polynomial extension of this result, proving that such intersections persist under polynomial shifts in any dimension. Let $P^{(1)},\dots,P^{(f)}\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be non-constant polynomials with positive leading coefficients and $P^{(j)}(0)=0$ for every $j$. We construct a partition of $\mathbb{N}^k$ into an arbitrarily fixed finite number of pieces such that for any coloring of $\mathbb{N}^k$ with finitely many colors, there exist $x_0\in \mathbb{N}$ and a single color class that meets all partition pieces after shifts by $x_0+P^{(j)}(h)$ in each of the $k$ coordinate directions, for every $j$ and infinitely many values $h\in \mathbb{N}$. Our proof exploits Weyl's equidistribution theory, Pontryagin duality, and the structure of polynomial relation lattices. We also prove some finite analogues of the above results for abelian groups and $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$.</description>

      <title>Ore-type condition for antidirected Hamilton cycles in oriented graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An antidirected cycle in a digraph $G$ is a subdigraph whose underlying graph is a cycle, and in which no two consecutive edges form a directed path in $G$. Let $\sigma_{+-}(G)$ be the minimum value of $d^+(x)+d^-(y)$ over all pairs of vertices $x, y$ such that there is no edge from $x$ to $y$, that is, $$\sigma_{+-}(G)=\min\{d^+(x)+d^-(y): \{x,y\}\subseteq V(G), xy\notin E(G)\}.$$ In 1972, Woodall extended Ore's theorem to digraphs by showing that every digraph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\sigma_{+-}(G)\geqslant n$ contains a directed Hamilton cycle. Very recently, this result was generalized to oriented graphs under the condition $\sigma_{+-}(G)\geqslant(3n-3)/4$. In this paper, we give the exact Ore-type degree threshold for the existence of antidirected Hamilton cycles in oriented graphs. More precisely, we prove that for sufficiently large even integer $n$, every oriented graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\sigma_{+-}(G)\geqslant(3n+2)/4$ contains an antidirected Hamilton cycle. Moreover, we show that this degree condition is best possible.</description>

      <title>Generalized Latin Square Graphs of Semigroups: A Counting Framework for Regularity and Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the \emph{Generalized Latin Square Graph} $\Gamma(S)$ of a finite semigroup $S$. Since we record global factorization multiplicities and local alternative counts, we define three counting invariants $N_S,N_R,N_C$. This gives that we have a simple degree formula \[ \text{deg}(v)=2n-3+Q(v),\qquad Q(v)=N_S(s_k)-2N_R(v)-2N_C(v). \] We show that $\Gamma(S)$ is regular exactly when $Q$ is constant. We apply the framework to cancellative semigroups, bands, Brandt semigroups and null semigroups. For null semigroups, since we identify $\Gamma(S)\cong K_n\times K_n$, we compute the spectrum and energy. A concise computational appendix lists the \texttt{GAP} driver and representative outputs.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies short brooms in edge-chromatic critical graphs. We prove that for any short broom in a $\Delta$-critical graph, at most one color is missing at more than one vertex. Moreover, this color (if exists) is missing at exactly two vertices. Applying this result, we verify the Vertex-splitting Conjecture for graphs with $\Delta \geq 2(n-1)/3$ and the Overfull Conjecture for $\Delta$-critical graphs satisfying $\Delta \geq (2n+5\delta-12)/3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical result of Tutte shows that every 4-connected planar graph is Hamiltonian. In recent years, there has been growing interest in extending classical Hamiltonian results from planar graphs to sparse graphs with drawings allowing crossings, such as $k$-planar graphs, where each edge is crossed at most $k$ times. For example, using different approaches, Hud\'ak, Tom\'a\v{s} and Suzuki, as well as Noguchi and Suzuki, independently proved that every optimal 1-planar graph is Hamiltonian. Here, an optimal 1-planar graph refers to one that attains the maximum possible number of edges. In this paper, we establish results on the Hamiltonicity of optimal 2-planar graphs, that is, 2-planar graphs with the maximum number of edges. More precisely, we show that every 4-connected optimal 2-planar graph is Hamiltonian-connected. With vertex-connectivity 3, there exist infinitely many optimal 2-planar graphs that are non-Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Bipartite Degree Realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the \emph{Bipartite Degree Realization} (BDR) problem: given a graphic degree sequence $D$, decide whether it admits a realization as a bipartite graph. While bipartite realizability for a fixed vertex partition can be decided in polynomial time via the Gale--Ryser theorem, the computational complexity of BDR without a prescribed partition remains unresolved. We address this question through a parameterized analysis.
  For constants $0 \le c_1 \le c_2 \le 1$, we define $\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ as the restriction of BDR to degree sequences of length $n$ whose degrees lie in the interval $[c_1 n, c_2 n]$. Our main result shows that $\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ is solvable in polynomial time whenever $0 \le c_1 \le c_2 \le \frac{\sqrt{c_1(c_1+4)}-c_1}{2}$, as well as for all $c_1 &gt; \tfrac12$. The proof relies on a reduction to extremal \emph{least balanced degree sequences} and a detailed verification of the critical Gale--Ryser inequalities, combined with a bounded subset-sum formulation.
  We further show that, assuming the NP-completeness of unrestricted BDR, the problem $\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ remains NP-complete for all $0 &lt; c_2 &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ and $c_1 &lt; 1 - c_2 - \sqrt{1-2c_2}$. % This establishes a sharp conditional boundary between tractable and intractable parameter regimes. Our results clarify the algorithmic landscape of bipartite degree realization and contribute to the broader study of potentially bipartite graphic degree sequences.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a question of Erd\"{o}s and inquiries by Beeson and Laczkovich, we explore the possible $N$ for which a triangle $T$ can tile into $N$ congruent copies of a triangle $R$. The \emph{reptile} cases (where $T$ is similar to $R$) and the \emph{commensurable-angles} cases (where all angles of $R$ are rational multiples of $\pi$) are well-understood. We tackle the most interesting remaining case, which is when $R$ contains an angle of $2\pi/3$ and when $T$ is one of $6$ ``sporadic'' specific triangles, of which only $2$ were known to have constructions. For each of these, we create a family of constructions and conjecture that they are the only possible $N$ that occur for these triangles.</description>

The resolution of $\overline{P}_n$ is the augmented wonderful variety corresponding to the graphic matroid of the complete graph. The resolution of $\overline{Q}_n$ is a further blowup, also a wonderful model of an arrangement in ${\mathbb P}^{n-1}$.</description>

      <title>Maximum Independent Set when excluding an induced minor: $K_1 + tK_2$ and $tC_3 \uplus C_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dallard, Milani\v{c}, and \v{S}torgel [arXiv '22] ask if for every class excluding a fixed planar graph $H$ as an induced minor, Maximum Independent Set can be solved in polynomial time, and show that this is indeed the case when $H$ is any planar complete bipartite graph, or the 5-vertex clique minus one edge, or minus two disjoint edges. A positive answer would constitute a far-reaching generalization of the state-of-the-art, when we currently do not know if a polynomial-time algorithm exists when $H$ is the 7-vertex path. Relaxing tractability to the existence of a quasipolynomial-time algorithm, we know substantially more. Indeed, quasipolynomial-time algorithms were recently obtained for the $t$-vertex cycle, $C_t$ [Gartland et al., STOC '21] and the disjoint union of $t$ triangles, $tC_3$ [Bonamy et al., SODA '23].
  We give, for every integer $t$, a polynomial-time algorithm running in $n^{O(t^5)}$ when $H$ is the friendship graph $K_1 + tK_2$ ($t$ disjoint edges plus a vertex fully adjacent to them), and a quasipolynomial-time algorithm running in $n^{O(t^2 \log n)+f(t)}$, with $f$ a single-exponential function, when $H$ is $tC_3 \uplus C_4$ (the disjoint union of $t$ triangles and a 4-vertex cycle). The former extends a classical result on graphs excluding $tK_2$ as an induced subgraph [Alekseev, DAM '07], while the latter extends Bonamy et al.'s result.</description>

      <title>Almost perfect nonlinear power functions with exponents expressed as fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a finite field, let $f$ be a function from $F$ to $F$, and let $a$ be a nonzero element of $F$. The discrete derivative of $f$ in direction $a$ is $\Delta_a f \colon F \to F$ with $(\Delta_a f)(x)=f(x+a)-f(x)$. The differential spectrum of $f$ is the multiset of cardinalities of all the fibers of all the derivatives $\Delta_a f$ as $a$ runs through $F^*$. An almost perfect nonlinear (APN) function is one for which the largest cardinality in its differential spectrum is $2$. Almost perfect nonlinear functions are of interest as cryptographic primitives. If $d$ is a positive integer, then the power function over $F$ with exponent $d$ is the function $f \colon F \to F$ with $f(x)=x^d$ for every $x \in F$. There is a small number of known infinite families of APN power functions. In this paper, we re-express the exponents for one such family in a more convenient form. This enables us not only to obtain the differential spectrum of each power function $f$ with an exponent in our family, but also to determine the elements that lie in an arbitrary fiber of the discrete derivative of $f$. This differential analysis, which is far more detailed than previous results, is achieved by composing the discrete derivative of $f$ with some permutations and a double covering of its domain to obtain a function whose fibers can more readily be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Simple Models of Randomization and Preservation Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to present a new and more uniform model-theoretic/combinatorial proof of the theorem ([5]): The randomization $T^{R}$ of a complete first-order theory $T$ with $NIP$ is a (complete) first-order continuous theory with $NIP$. The proof method is based on the significant use of a particular type of models of $T^{R}$, namely simple models, certain indiscernible arrays, and Rademacher mean width. Using simple models of $T^R$ gives the advantage of re-proving this theorem in a simpler and quantitative manner. We finally turn our attention to $NSOP$ in randomization. We show that based on the definition of $NSOP$ given [13], $T^R$ is stable if and only if it is $NIP$ and $NSOP$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $\mathscr A$ is a set of natural numbers of exponential density $\delta$, then the exponential density of all numbers of the form $x^3+a$ with $x\in\mathbb N$ and $a\in\mathscr A$ is at least $\min(1, \frac 13+\frac 56 \delta)$. This is a considerable improvement on the previous best lower bounds for this problem, obtained by Davenport more than 80 years ago. The result is the best possible for $\delta\ge \frac 45$.</description>

      <title>On the geography of log-surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey focuses on the geometric problem of log-surfaces, which are pairs consisting of a smooth projective surface and a reduced non-empty boundary divisor. In the first part, we focus on the geography problem for complex log-surfaces associated with pairs of the form $(\mathbb{P}^{2}, C)$, where $C$ is an arrangement of smooth plane curves admitting ordinary singularities. Specifically, we focus on the case in which $C$ is an arrangement consisting of smooth rational curves as its irreducible components. In the second part, containing original new results, we study log-surfaces constructed as pairs consisting of a complex projective $K3$ surface and a rational curve arrangement. In particular, we provide some combinatorial conditions for such pairs to have the log-Chern slope equal to $3$. Our survey is illustrated with many explicit examples of log-surfaces.</description>

      <title>Graph quandles: Generalized Cayley graphs of racks and right quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve two open problems of Valeriy Bardakov about Cayley graphs of racks and graph-theoretic realizations of right quasigroups. We also extend Didier Caucal's classification of labeled Cayley digraphs to right quasigroups and related algebraic structures like quandles.
  First, we characterize markings of graphs that realize racks. As an application, we construct rack-theoretic (di)graph invariants from permutation representations of graph automorphism groups. We describe how to compute these invariants with general results for path graphs and cycle graphs.
  Second, we show that all right quasigroups are realizable by edgeless graphs and complete (di)graphs. Using Schreier (di)graphs, we also characterize Cayley (di)graphs of right quasigroups Q that realize Q. In particular, all racks are realizable by their full Cayley (di)graphs.
  Finally, we give a graph-theoretic characterization of labeled Cayley digraphs of right-cancellative magmas, right-divisible magmas, right quasigroups, racks, quandles, involutory racks, and kei.</description>

      <title>Quiver superconformal index and giant gravitons: asymptotics and expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the $R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln |c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$, and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples. Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.</description>

      <title>On hyperbolic links associated to Eulerian subgraphs on right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytopes of finite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Eulerian cycles without transversal selfintersections in $4$-valent planar graphs. We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. We prove that there is always at least one Eulerian cycle of this type and introduce a transformation of a cycle along conjugated vertices allowing to build new cycles from a given one. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. It corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle on this polytope via the A.D. Mednykh's construction. We show that any Hamiltonian cycle on a compact right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope arises in this way, while in the finite volume case the necessary and sufficient condition is that at each ideal vertex it does not go straight. The link corresponding to a Hamiltonian cycle on a simple $3$-polytope always contains the Hopf link consisting of two circles. We consider links corresponding to Hamiltonian theta-graphs and Hamiltonian $K_4$-graphs on simple $3$-polytopes introduced by A.D. Mednykh and A.Yu. Vesnin. We give a criterion when such a link consists of mutually unlinked circles and when it is trivial. We give a necessary condition for such a link to be hyperbolic. The simplest example is the Borromean rings corresponding to the Hamiltonian theta-graph on the cube. We introduce the notions of a nonselfcrossing Eulerian theta-graph and $K_4$-graph on a right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope of finite volume with $2$ or $4$ finite vertices and construct the corresponding hyperbolic link.</description>

      <title>Quasipolynomial behavior via constructibility in multigraded algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Piecewise quasipolynomial growth of Presburger counting functions combines with tame persistent homology module theory to conclude piecewise quasipolynomial behavior of constructible families of finely graded modules over constructible commutative semigroup rings. Functorial preservation of constructibility for families under local cohomology, $\operatorname{Tor}$, and $\operatorname{Ext}$ yield piecewise quasipolynomial, quasilinear, or quasiconstant growth statements for length of local cohomology, $a$-invariants, regularity, depth; length of $\operatorname{Tor}$ and Betti numbers; length of $\operatorname{Ext}$ and Bass numbers; associated primes via $v$-invariants; and extended degrees, including the usual degree, Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity, arithmetic degree, and homological degree.</description>
