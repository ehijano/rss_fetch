      <title>Collision Aware Data Allocation In Multi-tube DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA storage is a promising archival data storage solution to today's big data problem. A DNA storage system encodes and stores digital data with synthetic DNA sequences and decodes DNA sequences back to digital data via sequencing. For efficient target data retrieving, existing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based DNA storage systems apply primers as specific identifiers to tag different sets of DNA strands. However, if a primer has collisions with any payload in the same DNA tube, the primer cannot safely serve as an identifier and must be disabled in this tube. In a DNA storage system with multiple DNA tubes, the primer-payload collisions can spread over all DNA tubes, repeatedly disable many primers, and cause a significant overall capacity reduction. This paper proposes using a collision-aware data allocation scheme to allocate data with different collisions into different tubes so that a primer banned in a tube because of primer-payload collision can be reused in other tubes. This allocation helps increase the number of usable primers over all tubes thus enhancing the overall storage capacity. The executing time of our scheme is $O(n^2)$ to the number of digital data chunks. The scheme serves as a pre-processing method for any DNA storage system. The evaluation of the state-of-the-art encoding scheme shows that the scheme can increase 20%-25% overall storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Photonic-Electronic Integrated Circuits for High-Performance Computing and AI Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, the demand for computational power has surged, particularly with the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). As we navigate the post-Moore's law era, the limitations of traditional electrical digital computing, including process bottlenecks and power consumption issue, are propelling the search for alternative computing paradigms. Among various emerging technologies, integrated photonics stands out as a promising solution for the next generation of high-performance computing due to the inherent advantages of light, such as low latency, high bandwidth, and unique multiplexing techniques. Furthermore, the progress in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which are equipped with abundant photoelectronic components, positions photonic-electronic integrated circuits as a viable solution for high-performance computing and as hardware AI accelerators. In this review, we survey recent advancements in both PIC-based digital and analog computing for AI, exploring the principal benefits and obstacles of implementation. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive analysis of photonic AI from the perspectives of hardware implementation, accelerator architecture, and software-hardware co-design. In the end, acknowledging the existing challenges, we underscore potential strategies for overcoming these issues and offer insights into the future drivers for optical computing.</description>

      <title>Solving a Real-World Package Delivery Routing Problem Using Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research focused on the conjunction between quantum computing and routing problems has been very prolific in recent years. Most of the works revolve around classical problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem or the Vehicle Routing Problem. Even though working on these problems is valuable, it is also undeniable that their academic-oriented nature falls short of real-world requirements. The main objective of this research is to present a solving method for realistic instances, avoiding problem relaxations or technical shortcuts. Instead, a quantum-classical hybrid solver has been developed, coined Q4RPD, that considers a set of real constraints such as a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, priority deliveries, and capacities characterized by two values: weight and dimensions of the packages. Q4RPD resorts to the Leap Constrained Quadratic Model Hybrid Solver of D-Wave. To demonstrate the application of Q4RPD, an experimentation composed of six different instances has been conducted, aiming to serve as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Cross-layer Modeling and Design of Content Addressable Memories in Advanced Technology Nodes for Similarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a comprehensive design and benchmarking study of Content Addressable Memory (CAM) at the 7nm technology node in the context of similarity search applications. We design CAM cells based on SRAM, spin-orbit torque, and ferroelectric field effect transistor devices and from their layouts extract cell parasitics using state of the art EDA tools. These parasitics are used to develop SPICE netlists to model search operations. We use a CAM-based dataset search and a sequential recommendation system to highlight the application-level performance degradation due to interconnect parasitics. We propose and evaluate two solutions to mitigate interconnect effects.</description>

      <title>Hardware in Loop Learning with Spin Stochastic Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the promise of superior efficiency and scalability, real-world deployment of emerging nanoelectronic platforms for brain-inspired computing have been limited thus far, primarily because of inter-device variations and intrinsic non-idealities. In this work, we demonstrate mitigating these issues by performing learning directly on practical devices through a hardware-in-loop approach, utilizing stochastic neurons based on heavy metal/ferromagnetic spin-orbit torque heterostructures. We characterize the probabilistic switching and device-to-device variability of our fabricated devices of various sizes to showcase the effect of device dimension on the neuronal dynamics and its consequent impact on network-level performance. The efficacy of the hardware-in-loop scheme is illustrated in a deep learning scenario achieving equivalent software performance. This work paves the way for future large-scale implementations of neuromorphic hardware and realization of truly autonomous edge-intelligent devices.</description>

      <title>No distributed quantum advantage for approximate graph coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an almost complete characterization of the hardness of $c$-coloring $\chi$-chromatic graphs with distributed algorithms, for a wide range of models of distributed computing. In particular, we show that these problems do not admit any distributed quantum advantage. To do that: 1) We give a new distributed algorithm that finds a $c$-coloring in $\chi$-chromatic graphs in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds, with $\alpha = \bigl\lfloor\frac{c-1}{\chi - 1}\bigr\rfloor$. 2) We prove that any distributed algorithm for this problem requires $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})$ rounds.
  Our upper bound holds in the classical, deterministic LOCAL model, while the near-matching lower bound holds in the non-signaling model. This model, introduced by Arfaoui and Fraigniaud in 2014, captures all models of distributed graph algorithms that obey physical causality; this includes not only classical deterministic LOCAL and randomized LOCAL but also quantum-LOCAL, even with a pre-shared quantum state.
  We also show that similar arguments can be used to prove that, e.g., 3-coloring 2-dimensional grids or $c$-coloring trees remain hard problems even for the non-signaling model, and in particular do not admit any quantum advantage. Our lower-bound arguments are purely graph-theoretic at heart; no background on quantum information theory is needed to establish the proofs.</description>

      <title>LLMR: Real-time Prompting of Interactive Worlds using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Large Language Model for Mixed Reality (LLMR), a framework for the real-time creation and modification of interactive Mixed Reality experiences using LLMs. LLMR leverages novel strategies to tackle difficult cases where ideal training data is scarce, or where the design goal requires the synthesis of internal dynamics, intuitive analysis, or advanced interactivity. Our framework relies on text interaction and the Unity game engine. By incorporating techniques for scene understanding, task planning, self-debugging, and memory management, LLMR outperforms the standard GPT-4 by 4x in average error rate. We demonstrate LLMR's cross-platform interoperability with several example worlds, and evaluate it on a variety of creation and modification tasks to show that it can produce and edit diverse objects, tools, and scenes. Finally, we conducted a usability study (N=11) with a diverse set that revealed participants had positive experiences with the system and would use it again.</description>

      <title>AltGraph: Redesigning Quantum Circuits Using Generative Graph Models for Efficient Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuit transformation aims to produce equivalent circuits while optimizing for various aspects such as circuit depth, gate count, and compatibility with modern Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. There are two techniques for circuit transformation. The first is a rule-based approach that greedily cancels out pairs of gates that equate to the identity unitary operation. Rule-based approaches are used in quantum compilers such as Qiskit, tket, and Quilc. The second is a search-based approach that tries to find an equivalent quantum circuit by exploring the quantum circuits search space. Search-based approaches typically rely on machine learning techniques such as generative models and Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose AltGraph, a novel search-based circuit transformation approach that generates equivalent quantum circuits using existing generative graph models. We use three main graph models: DAG Variational Autoencoder (D-VAE) with two variants: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Deep Generative Model for Graphs (DeepGMG) that take a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the quantum circuit as input and output a new DAG from which we reconstruct the equivalent quantum circuit. Next, we perturb the latent space to generate equivalent quantum circuits some of which may be more compatible with the hardware coupling map and/or enable better optimization leading to reduced gate count and circuit depth. AltGraph achieves on average a 37.55% reduction in the number of gates and a 37.75% reduction in the circuit depth post-transpiling compared to the original transpiled circuit with only 0.0074 Mean Squared Error (MSE) in the density matrix.</description>
