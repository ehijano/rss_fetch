      <title>Evaluation of post-blast damage in cut blasting with varying extra-depths: insights from 2D simulations and 3D experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In blasting engineering, borehole utilization is a key metric for evaluating blasting performance. While previous studies have examined the effects of expansion space, cutting design, in-situ stress conditions, and rock properties on borehole utilization, research on the intrinsic relationship between extra-depth defined as the portion of the cut hole extending beyond the depth of auxiliary holes and borehole utilization remains insufficient. This gap in understanding has hindered the resolution of issues such as residual boreholes and unbroken rock at the borehole bottom in deep-hole blasting, thereby limiting improvements in borehole utilization. This study employs a simplified double-hole model for extra-depth cut blasting to conduct two-dimensional numerical simulations and three-dimensional cement mortar model experiments. It systematically investigates the blasting damage characteristics, fractal damage, and energy evolution under varying extra-depth as a single variable. Experimental parameters such as borehole utilization, cavity diameter, cavity volume, and fragment size distribution were obtained to comprehensively analyze the nonlinear effects of extra-depth on post-blast rock damage and its mechanisms. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that blasting damage parameters exhibit a nonlinear trend of initially increasing and then decreasing with increasing extra-depth. Appropriately increasing the extra-depth improves rock breakage efficiency, while excessive extra-depth reduces efficiency due to confinement effects at the borehole bottom. Adjusting the extra-depth can optimize the distribution of explosive energy between rock fragmentation and rock ejection.</description>

      <title>Interest of geophysical methods to determine the evolution and the spatial distribution of sedimentary deposits upstream of run-of-the-river dams (Upper Rh{\^o}ne, France)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydraulic structures such as dams have a direct or indirect influence on the hydro-sedimentary functioning of rivers. They can impact the sediment continuity of the river and can create a sediment imbalance with zones of sediment accumulation upstream and a lack of sediment downstream from the dam. Upstream deposits are a major issue for managers as they can impact the operation and/oraffect the safety of the structure and induce extra-flood hazards. Operators therefore seek to determine the physical characteristics of these deposits to determine their remobilization potential.Usually, these sediment deposits are described using bathymetric data, sonar images or samples (dredging, coring). For this study, new measurements from two geophysical methods (acoustic and electromagnetic) were used in addition to these current monitoring methods. The contribution of geophysical techniques is undeniable to improve the characterization of these deposits. These measurements make it possible to: i) define the internal structures of the sediments, ii) determine the spatial distribution of these structures over the entire development, iii) evaluate the volumes deposited when little bathymetric data is available on the reservoir. The coupling of these methods thus makes it possible to reconstruct the evolution and the structuring events of the sedimentary deposits. This approach provides complementary and important elements for managers in terms of exploitation and optimization of sedimentary deposits management scenarios.</description>

      <title>Urban Sensing Using Existing Fiber-Optic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of urban seismic signals offers valuable insights into urban environments and society. Yet, accurate detection and localization of seismic sources on a city-wide scale with conventional seismographic network is unavailable due to the prohibitive costs of ultra-dense seismic arrays required for imaging high-frequency anthropogenic sources. Here, we leverage existing fiber-optic networks as a distributed acoustic sensing system to accurately locate urban seismic sources and estimate how their intensity varies over time. By repurposing a 50-kilometer telecommunication fiber into an ultra-dense seismic array, we generate spatiotemporal maps of seismic source power (SSP) across San Jose, California. Our approach overcomes the proximity limitations of urban seismic sensing, enabling accurate localization of remote seismic sources generated by urban activities, such as traffic, construction, and school operations. We also show strong correlations between SSP values and environmental noise levels, as well as various persistent urban features, including land use patterns and demographics.</description>

      <title>Winter Noctilucent Clouds Following Sudden Stratospheric Warming: First Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesospheric structures identical to summer noctilucent clouds were observed during the nights of December 17-19, 2024 in Siberian Russia. Basing on the available photo data, the mean altitude of the clouds 70.1+-1.5 km was measured by umbral colorimetric method. This coincided spatially and temporary with deep temperature minimum below 160K in mesosphere, followed the polar vortex displacement and warming of stratosphere below the clouds. The satellite data on temperature and water vapor is used to study the nature of this unexpected event.</description>
