      <title>Flowy: High performance probabilistic lava emplacement prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lava emplacement is a complex physical phenomenon, affected by several factors. These include, but are not limited to features of the terrain, the lava settling process, the effusion rate or total erupted volume, and the probability of effusion from different locations. One method, which has been successfully employed to predict lava flow emplacement and forecast the inundated area and final lava thickness, is the MrLavaLoba method from Vitturi et al. The MrLavaLoba method has been implemented in their code of the same name. Here, we introduce Flowy, a new computational tool that implements the MrLavaLoba method in a more efficient manner. New fast algorithms have been incorporated for all performance critical code paths, resulting in a complete overhaul of the implementation. When compared to the MrLavaLoba code, Flowy exhibits a significant reduction in runtime -- between 100 to 400 times faster -- depending on the specific input parameters. The accuracy and the probabilistic convergence of the model outputs are not compromised, maintaining high fidelity in generating possible lava flow paths and deposition characteristics. We have validated Flowy's performance and reliability through comprehensive unit-testing and a real-world eruption scenario. The source code is freely available on GitHub, facilitating transparency, reproducibility and collaboration within the geoscientific community.</description>

      <title>Detection of Approaching Critical Transitions in Natural Systems Driven by Red Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of critical slowing down (CSD) is the dominant avenue for anticipating critical transitions from noisy time-series data. Most commonly, changes in variance and lag-1 autocorrelation [AC(1)] are used as CSD indicators. However, these indicators will only produce reliable results if the noise driving the system is white and stationary. In the more realistic case of time-correlated red noise, increasing (decreasing) the correlation of the noise will lead to spurious (masked) alarms for both variance and AC(1). Here, we propose two new methods that can discriminate true CSD from possible changes in the driving noise characteristics. We focus on estimating changes in the linear restoring rate based on Langevin-type dynamics driven by either white or red noise. We assess the capacity of our new estimators to anticipate critical transitions and show that they perform significantly better than other existing methods both for continuous-time and discrete-time models. In addition to conceptual models, we apply our methods to climate model simulations of the termination of the African Humid Period. The estimations rule out spurious signals stemming from nonstationary noise characteristics and reveal a destabilization of the African climate system as the dynamical mechanism underlying this archetype of abrupt climate change in the past.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Method to Compute the Tides of Laterally-Heterogeneous Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Body tides reveal information about planetary interiors and affect their evolution. Most models to compute body tides rely on the assumption of a spherically-symmetric interior. However, several processes can lead to lateral variations of interior properties. We present a new spectral method to compute the tidal response of laterally-heterogeneous bodies. Compared to previous spectral methods, our approach is not limited to small-amplitude lateral variations; compared to finite element codes, the approach is more computationally-efficient. While the tidal response of a spherically-symmetric body has the same wave-length as the tidal force; lateral heterogeneities produce an additional tidal response with an spectra that depends on the spatial pattern of such variations. For Mercury, the Moon and Io the amplitude of this signal is as high as $1\%-10\%$ the main tidal response for long-wavelength shear modulus variations higher than $\sim 10\%$ the mean shear modulus. For Europa, Ganymede and Enceladus, shell-thickness variations of $50\%$ the mean shell thickness can cause an additional signal of $\sim 1\%$ and $\sim 10\%$ for the Jovian moons and Encelaudus, respectively. Future missions, such as $ \textit{BepiColombo}$ and $\textit{JUICE}$, might measure these signals. Lateral variations of viscosity affect the distribution of tidal heating. This can drive the thermal evolution of tidally-active bodies and affect the distribution of active regions.</description>
