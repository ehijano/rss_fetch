      <title>A solvable embedding mechanism for one-dimensional spinless and Majorana fermions in higher-dimensional spin-1/2 magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We write down a class of two-dimensional quantum spin-1/2 Hamiltonians whose eigenspectra are exactly solvable via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The general structure corresponds to a suitable grid composed of XY or XX-Ising spin chains and ZZ-Ising spin chains and is generalizable to higher dimensions. They can host stacks of one-dimensional spinless fermion liquids with gapless excitations and power-law correlations coexisting with ordered spin moments (localized spinless fermions). Bond-dependent couplings thus can be an alternate mechanism than geometric frustration of SU(2)-symmetric couplings to obtain spinless fermionic excitations. Put in a different way, bond-dependent couplings allow for an embedding of one-dimensional spinless fermion (Tomonoga-Luttinger) liquids and solids and also Majorana excitations in higher dimensions. They can accommodate a simpler set of site-local conserved quantities apart from the more intricate, interlocked set of plaquette-local or bond-local conserved quantities in Kitaev's honeycomb model with Majorana excitations. The proposed grid structure may provide an architecture for quantum engineering with controllable qubits.</description>

      <title>Critical properties of metallic and deconfined quantum critical points in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use large-scale fermion quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study metallic and deconfined quantum phase transitions in a bilayer honeycomb model, focusing on their quantum critical and finite-temperature properties. At weak interaction, a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal state is realized. At intermediate and strong interaction, respectively, two long-range-ordered phases that break different symmetries are stabilized. The ordered phases feature partial and full, respectively, gap openings in the fermion spectrum. We clarify the symmetries of the different zero-temperature phases and the symmetry breaking patterns across the two quantum phase transitions between them. The first transition between the disordered and long-range-ordered semimetallic phases has previously been argued to be described by the $(2+1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu-SO(3) field theory. By performing simulations with an improved symmetric Trotter decomposition, we further substantiate this claim by computing the critical exponents $1/\nu$, $\eta_\phi$, and $\eta_\psi$, which turn out to be consistent with the field-theoretical expectation within numerical and analytical uncertainties. The second transition between the two long-range-ordered phases has previously been proposed as a possible instance of a metallic deconfined quantum critical point. We further develop this scenario by analyzing the spectral functions in the single-particle, particle-hole, and particle-particle channels. Our results indicate gapless excitations with a unique velocity, supporting the emergence of Lorentz symmetry at criticality. We also determine the finite-temperature phase boundaries above the fully gapped state at large interaction, which smoothly vanish near the putative metallic deconfined quantum critical point, consistent with a continuous or weakly first-order transition.</description>

      <title>High-entropy magnetism of murunskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Murunskite (K$_2$FeCu$_3$S$_4$) is a bridging compound between the only two known families of high-temperature superconductors. It is a semiconductor like the parent compounds of cuprates, yet isostructural to metallic iron-pnictides. Moreover, like both families, it has an antiferromagnetic (AF)-like response with an ordered phase occurring below $\approx$ 100 K. Through comprehensive neutron, M\"ossbauer, and XPS measurements on single crystals, we unveil AF with a nearly commensurate quarter-zone wave vector. Intriguingly, the only identifiable magnetic atoms, iron, are randomly distributed over one-quarter of available crystallographic sites in 2D planes, while the remaining sites are occupied by closed-shell copper. Notably, any interpretation in terms of a spin-density wave is challenging, in contrast to the metallic iron-pnictides where Fermi-surface nesting can occur. Our findings align with a disordered-alloy picture featuring magnetic interactions up to second neighbors. Moreover, in the paramagnetic state, iron ions are either in Fe$^{3+}$ or Fe$^{2+}$ oxidation states, associated with two distinct paramagnetic sites identified by M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. Upon decreasing the temperature below the appearance of magnetic interactions, these two signals merge completely into a third, implying an orbital transition. It completes the cascade of (local) transitions that transform iron atoms from fully orbitally and magnetically disordered to homogeneously ordered in inverse space, but still randomly distributed in real space.</description>

      <title>Gapless dynamic magnetic ground state in the charge-gapped trimer iridate Ba$_4$NbIr$_3$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental investigation of the magnetic ground state in Ba$_4$NbIr$_3$O$_{12}$, a fractional valent trimer iridate. X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy show that the Ir valence lies between 3+ and 4+ while Nb is pentavalent. Combined dc/ac magnetization, specific heat, and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements reveal no magnetic phase transition down to 0.05~K. Despite a significant Weiss temperature ($\Theta_{\mathrm{W}} \sim -15$ to $-25$~K) indicating antiferromagnetic correlations, a quantum spin-liquid (QSL) phase emerges and persists down to 0.1~K. This state likely arises from geometric frustration in the edge-sharing equilateral triangle Ir network. Our $\mu$SR analysis reveals a two-component depolarization, arising from the coexistence of rapidly (90\%) and slowly (10\%) fluctuating Ir moments. Powder x-ray diffraction and Ir-L$_3$edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy identify ~8-10\% Nb/Ir site-exchange, reducing frustration within part of the Ir network, and likely leading to the faster muon spin relaxation, while the structurally ordered Ir ions remain highly geometrically frustrated, giving rise to the rapidly spin-fluctuating QSL ground state. At low temperatures, the magnetic specific heat varies as $\gamma T + \alpha T^2$, indicating gapless spinon excitations, and possible Dirac QSL features with linear spinon dispersion, respectively.</description>

      <title>Thermal decay of two-spinon bound states in quasi-2D triangular antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the temperature evolution of the anomalous magnetic spectrum of the spin-1/2 triangular quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is proximate to a quantum critical point. Recently, its low energy excitations have been identified with two-spinon bound states, well defined in an ample region of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we compute the thermal magnetic spectrum within a Schwinger boson approach, incorporating Gaussian fluctuations around the saddle-point approximation. In order to account for a finite N\'eel temperature $T_N$, we incorporate an exchange interaction between triangular layers. As temperature rises, the dispersion relation of the two-spinon bound states, representing single-magnon excitations, remains unchanged but becomes mixed with the thermally activated spinon continuum. Consequently, a crossover occurs at a temperature $T^* \simeq 0.75 T_N$, defining a "terminated Goldstone regime" between $T^*$ and $T_N$, where only the Goldstone modes survives as well-defined magnon excitations, up to the N\'eel temperature. Our results support the idea that the fractionalization of magnons near a quantum critical point can be extended to more realistic quasi-2D frustrated antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum-geometry-facilitated pair density wave order: Density matrix renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, confirmation via sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the phase diagram of a simple two-orbital model incorporating quantum geometric effect in a strong coupling regime. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase with no coexisting competing orders across a broad range of doping concentration and tuning interaction parameter. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometric effects promote PDW formation. Our study provides by far the strongest evidence for the quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, thereby opening an avenue for further exploration of PDWs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic symmetries of terbium tetraboride (TbB4) revealed by resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experimental study of TbB4 at a low temperature using resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction implies a magnetic symmetry not found in any other rare-earth tetraboride. The evidence for this assertion is a change in the intensity of a TbB4 Bragg spot on reversing the handedness (chirality) of the primary x-ray beam [Misawa et al., Phys. Rev. B 108, 134433 (2023)]. It reveals a magnetic chiral signature in TbB4 that is forbidden in phases of rare-earth tetraborides known to date. For, the previous magnetic symmetries are parity-time (PT)-symmetric with anti-inversion present in the magnetic crystal class. Misawa et al. appeal to a (PT)-symmetric diffraction pattern to interpret their interesting experimental results. In addition to the use of symmetry that does not permit a chiral signature, calculated patterns impose cylindrical symmetry on Tb sites with no justification. We review magnetic symmetries for TbB4 consistent with a published neutron powder diffraction pattern and susceptibility measurements. The investigated symmetry templates are non-centrosymmetric, non-collinear antiferromagnetic constructions with propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0). An inferred chiral signature for a parity-even absorption event has an interesting composition. There is the anticipated product of Tb axial dipoles and charge-like quadrupoles (from Templeton-Templeton scattering). Beyond this contribution, though, symmetry allows a product of dipoles in the chiral signature. A predicted change in the intensity of a Bragg spot with rotation of the crystal about the reflection vector (an azimuthal angle scan) can be tested in future experiments. Likewise, contributions to Bragg diffraction patterns from Tb anapoles and higher-order Dirac multipoles.</description>

      <title>Is the Valence Bond Solid state in $J_1$-$J_2$ Square Lattice Heisenberg Model Plaquette or Columnar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Fully Augmented Matrix Product States (FAMPS) methods to investigate the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model. To differentiate between the Columnar Valence Bond Solid (CVBS) and Plaquette Valence Bond Solid (PVBS) phases, we introduce an anisotropy $\Delta_y$ in the nearest neighboring coupling in the $y$-direction, aiming at detecting the possible spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. In the calculations, we push the bond dimension to as large as $D = 25000$ in FAMPS, simulating systems at a maximum size of $14 \times 14$. With a careful extrapolation of the truncation errors and appropriate finite-size scaling, followed by finite $\Delta_y$ scaling analysis of the VBS dimer order parameters, we identify the VBS phase as a PVBS type, meaning there is no spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. This study not only resolves the long-standing issue of the characterization of the VBS order in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model but also highlights the capabilities of FAMPS in the study of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Phonon Heat Transport and Anisotropic Tuning of Quantum Fluctuations in a Frustrated Honeycomb Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Honeycomb cobalt oxides containing 3$\it{d}$ Co$^{2+}$ ions might realize frustrated magnetism and novel quantum phases. Among candidate materials, Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$ stands out for its distorted honeycomb lattice and significant in-plane anisotropy, motivating vector-field tuning inside the honeycomb plane. Here we use thermal transport down to the mK regime to study twin-free crystals of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$ subject to in-plane vector fields. We find that the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ never exceeds the heat-transport capability of phonons, rendering its suppression primarily due to phonon scattering off magnetic excitations and/or domain boundaries. The system's field-driven quantum criticality manifests itself as an abundance of magnetic fluctuations hindering the heat transport, which further depends on the field direction in an intriguing manner.</description>

      <title>Spin waves and three-dimensionality in the high-pressure antiferromagnetic phase of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnetic materials can provide explicit realizations of paradigm models in quantum many-body physics. In this context, SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ is a faithful realization of the Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM) for ideally frustrated spin dimers, even displaying several of its quantum magnetic phases as a function of pressure. We perform inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ at 5.5 GPa and 4.5 K, observing spin waves that characterize the high-pressure antiferromagnetic phase. The experimental spectra are well described by linear spin-wave calculations on a SSM with an inter-layer interaction, which is determined accurately as $J_c = 0.053(3)$ meV. The presence of $J_c$ indicates the need to account for the three-dimensional nature of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ in theoretical models, also at lower pressures. We find that the ratio between in-plane interactions, $J'/J = 1.8(2)$, undergoes a dramatic change compared to lower pressures that we deduce is driven by a sharp drop in the dimer coupling, $J$. Our results underline the wide horizons opened by high-pressure INS experiments on quantum magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Electronic spin susceptibility in metallic strontium titanate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$) is known to have both normal-state and superconducting properties that vary strongly over a wide range of charge carrier densities. This indicates the importance of nonlinear dynamics, and has hindered the development of a clear qualitative description of the observed behaviour. A major challenge is to understand how the charge carriers themselves evolve with doping and temperature, with possible polaronic effects and evidence of an effective mass that strongly increases with temperature. Here we use $^{47,49}$Ti nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to perform a comprehensive study of the electronic spin susceptibility in the dilute metallic state of strontium titanate across the doping-temperature phase diagram. We find a temperature-dependent Knight shift that can be quantitatively understood within a non-degenerate Fermi gas model that fully takes into account the complex band structure of SrTiO$_3$. Our data are consistent with a temperature-independent effective mass, and we show that the behavior of the spin susceptibility is universal in a wide range of temperatures and carrier concentrations. These results provide a microscopic foundation for the understanding of the properties of the unconventional low-density metallic state in strontium titanate and related materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials provide an ideal platform for exploring quantum phases of matter. However, solving the many-electron problem in moir\'e systems is challenging due to strong correlation effects. We introduce a powerful variational representation of quantum states, many-body neural Bloch wavefunction, to solve many-electron problems in moir\'e materials accurately and efficiently. Applying our method to the semiconductor heterobilayer WSe2/WS2 , we obtain a generalized Wigner crystal at filling factor n = 1/3, a Mott insulator n = 1, and a correlated insulator with local magnetic moments and antiferromagnetic spin correlation at n = 2. Our neural network approach improves the simulation accuracy of strongly interacting moir\'e materials and paves the way for discovery of new quantum phases with variational learning principle in a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and low-energy gap in triangular quantum spin liquid NaYbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report neutron scattering, pressure-dependent AC calorimetry, and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements of triangular lattice NaYbSe$_2$. We observe a continuum of scattering, which is reproduced by matrix product simulations, and no phase transition is detected in any bulk measurements. Comparison to heat capacity simulations suggest the material is within the Heisenberg spin liquid phase. AC Susceptibility shows a significant 23~mK downturn, indicating a gap in the magnetic spectrum. The combination of a gap with no detectable magnetic order, comparison to theoretical models, and comparison to other $A$YbSe$_2$ compounds all strongly indicate NaYbSe$_2$ is within the quantum spin liquid phase. The gap also allows us to rule out a gapless Dirac spin liquid, with a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ liquid the most natural explanation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gibbs ensembles in weakly interacting dissipative systems and digital quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital quantum computers promise to solve important and challenging problems in many-body quantum physics. However, at least for the superconducting platforms, their current limitation is the noise level. It thus seems more reasonable to presently use them to model dissipative systems, where platforms' native noise is not that crucial. Here, we propose using a digital quantum computer to showcase the activation of integrability by realizing exotic generalized Gibbs ensembles in weakly dissipative integrable systems. Dissipation is realized by coupling system's qubits to periodically reset ancilla ones, like in the protocol recently used to realize dissipative cooling. We derive the effective equations of motion for trotterized dynamics and contrast such a setup to the usual Lindblad continuous evolution. For simplicity, we consider and compare different approaches to calculating steady-states of non-interacting integrable systems weakly coupled to baths, where thermodynamic results can be obtained via a generalized scattering theory between the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Corresponding quantum computer implementation would illuminate the possibilities of realizing similar exotic states in nearly integrable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports a gapless (Goldstone) magnon mode. In particular, we develop a scenario wherein pairing in the spin-canted state emerges from a novel type of magnon-mediated attraction: Contrary to conventional mechanisms that involve the exchange of a single boson, we show that second-order processes that exchange two magnons are dominant and produce an $s$-wave pairing interaction featuring a unique logarithmic low-frequency divergence. This low-frequency divergence disappears when spin-orbit coupling vanishes, providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced exciton formation and superconductivity in platinum-based mineral Sperrylite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of Sperrylite (PtAs2), the main platinum source in natural minerals, as a function of applied pressures up to 150 GPa. While no structural phase transition was detected from pressure-dependent X-ray measurements, the unit cell volume shrinks monotonically with pressure following the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The mildly semiconducting behavior found in pure synthesized crystals at ambient pressures becomes more insulating upon increasing applied pressure before metalizing at higher pressures, giving way to the appearance of an abrupt decrease in resistance near 3 K at pressures above 92 GPa consistent with the onset of a superconducing phase. The pressure evolution of the calculated electronic band structure reveals the same physical trend as our transport measurements, with a non-monotonic evolution explained by a hole band that is pushed below the Fermi energy and an electron band that approaches it as a function of pressure, both reaching a touching point suggestive of an excitonic state. A topological Lifshitz transition of the electronic structure and an increase in the density of states may naturally explain the onset of superconductivity in this material</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

      <title>Correlators of Worldline Proper Length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical observer can measure elapsed proper time along their worldline. When observers are coupled to a system with internal correlations, measurements of elapsed time may inherit these correlations. We show that derivatives of the on-shell action with respect to worldline mass compute correlation functions of worldline proper length at tree level. We study worldlines coupled to a scalar field. We calculate the length-length two-point function and find it arises from correlated path fluctuations. As an application, we propose that the logarithm of local correlators serves as a generating function of length correlators, which generalizes the on-shell action prescription. Using this proposal, we extract AdS worldline observables from local CFT correlators as computed by Witten diagrams. We briefly discuss extensions to gravity, interferometers, and the holographic encoding of observer time.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer in T/H heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ charge density wave state of the T polytype of MX$_2$ (M=Nb,Ta, X=S, Se) is known to host a half-filled flat band, which electronic correlations drive into a Mott insulating state. When T polytypes are coupled to strongly metallic H polytypes, such as in T/H bilayer heterostructures or the bulk 4H$_b$ polytype, charge transfer can destabilize the Mott state, but quantifying its magnitude has been a source of controversy. In this work, we perform a systematic ab-initio study of charge transfer for all experimentally relevant T/H bilayers and bulk 4H$_b$ structures. In all cases we find charge transfer from T to H layers which depends strongly on the interlayer distance but weakly on the Hubbard interaction. Additionally, Se compounds display smaller charge transfer than S compounds, and 4H$_b$ bulk polytypes display more charge transfer than isolated bilayers. We rationalize these findings in terms of band structure properties, and argue they might explain differences between compounds observed experimentally. Our work reveals the tendency to Mott insulation and the origin of superconductivity may vary significantly across the family of T/H heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Percolation renormalization group analysis of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical study of confinement in lattice gauge theories (LGTs) remains a difficult task to this day. Taking a geometric perspective on confinement, we develop a real-space renormalization group (RG) formalism for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs using percolation probability as a confinement order parameter. The RG flow we analyze is constituted by both the percolation probability and the coupling parameters. We consider a classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in two dimensions, with matter and thermal fluctuations, and analytically derive the confinement phase diagram. We find good agreement with numerical and exact benchmark results and confirm that a finite matter density enforces confinement at $T&lt;\infty$ in the model we consider. Our RG scheme enables future analytical studies of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs with matter and quantum fluctuations and beyond.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and distinct density wave orders in correlated Kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome metal CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ has attracted much recent attention due to the coexistence of multiple exotic orders and the associated proposals to mimic unconventional high temperature superconductors. Nevertheless, magnetism and strong electronic correlations -- two essential ingredients for unconventional superconductivity, are absent in this V-based Kagome metal. CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ is a newly discovered Cr-based parallel of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, in which magnetism appears with charge density wave and superconductivity at different temperature and pressure regions. Enhanced electronic correlations are also suggested by theoretical proposals due to the calculated flat bands. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission measurements and first-principles calculations on this new material system. Electron energy bands and the associated orbitals are resolved. Flat bands are observed near the Fermi level. Doping dependent measurements on Cs(Cr$_x$V$_{1-x}$)$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a gradually enhanced band renormalization from CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ to CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, accompanied by distinct spatial symmetry breaking states in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Quantum hall transformer in a quantum point contact over the full range of transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent experiment [Cohen et al., Science 382, 542 (2023)] observed a quantized $e^2/2h$ conductance tunneling into a fractional quantum hall edge in the strong coupling limit, which is consistent with the prediction of a quantum Hall transformer. We model this quantum point contact (QPC) as a quantum wire with a spatially-varying Luttinger parameter and a back-scattering impurity and use a numerical solution to find the wavepacket scattering and microwave (i.e. finite frequency) has conductance at the interface. We then compare the microwave conductance to an analytic solution of a Luttinger liquid with an abruptly varying Luttinger parameter and a back-scattering impurity, which is obtained by mapping the problem to a boundary sine-Gordon (BSG) model. Finally, we show that the quantum Hall transformer can survive the inclusion of the domain wall which is expected to occur in a wide QPC, which is experimentally relevant, provided the momentum change in the QPC is generated by electrostatics. We find that back-scattering generated by the domain wall is of an order of magnitude consistent with the experiment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation of the 3D Ising Transition on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for simulating the 3D phase transition on the recently proposed fuzzy sphere [Phys. Rev. X 13, 021009 (2023)]. By introducing an additional $SU(2)$ layer degree of freedom, we reformulate the model into a form suitable for sign-problem-free QMC simulation. From the finite-size-scaling, we show that this QMC-friendly model undergoes a quantum phase transition belonging to the 3D Ising universality class, and at the critical point we compute the scaling dimensions from the state-operator correspondence, which largely agrees with the prediction from the conformal field theory. These results pave the way to construct sign-problem-free models for QMC simulations on the fuzzy sphere, which could advance the future study on more sophisticated criticalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By circumventing the difficulty of obtaining exact string state solutions to Bethe ansatz equations, we devise a truncated string state space approach for investigating spin dynamics in a nonintegrable spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain subjected to a staggered field at various magnetizations. The obtained dynamical spectra reveal a series of elastic peaks at integer multiples of the ordering wave vector $Q$, indicating the presence of multi-$Q$ Bethe string states within the ground state. The spectrum exhibits a separation between different string continua as the strength of the staggered field increases at low magnetization, reflecting the confinement of the Bethe strings. This approach provides a unified string-state-based framework for understanding spin dynamics in low-dimensional nonintegrable Heisenberg models, which has a successful application to observations across various phases of the quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet $\rm YbAlO_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NF) are powerful generative models with increasing applications in augmenting Monte Carlo algorithms due to their high flexibility and expressiveness. In this work we explore the integration of NF in Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DMC), presenting an architecture designed to sample the intricate multidimensional space of Feynman's diagrams through dimensionality reduction. By decoupling the sampling of diagram order and interaction times, the flow focuses on one interaction at a time. This enables constructing a general diagram by employing the same unsupervised model iteratively, dressing a zero-order diagram with interactions determined by the previously sampled order. The resulting NF-augmented DMC is tested on the widely used single-site Holstein polaron model in the entire electron-phonon coupling regime. The obtained data show that the model accurately reproduces the diagram distribution reducing sample correlation and statistical error for observables such as the polaron binding energy and the interacting Green's function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy effective theory of a Fermi surface coupled to an Ising-nematic quantum critical point in (2+1) spacetime dimensions with translation symmetry. We formulate the system using the large $N$ Yukawa-SYK model, whose saddle point is described by the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The low-energy physics can be revealed by studying the Gaussian fluctuation spectrum around the saddle point, which is generated by the Bethe-Salpeter kernel $K_\text{BS}$. Based on the Ward identities, we propose an inner product on the space of two point functions, which reveals a large number of soft modes of $K_\text{BS}$. These soft modes parameterize deformation of the Fermi surface, and their fluctuation eigenvalues describe their decay rates. We analytically compute these eigenvalues for a circular Fermi surface, and we discover the odd-parity modes to be parametrically longer-lived than the even-parity modes, due to the kinematic constraint of fermions scattering on a convex FS. The sign of the eigenvalues signals an instability of the Ising-nematic quantum critical point at zero temperature for a convex Fermi surface. At finite temperature, the system can be stabilized by thermal fluctuations of the critical boson. We derive an effective action that describes the soft-mode dynamics, and it leads to a linearized Boltzmann equation, where the real part of the soft-mode eigenvalues can be interpreted as the collision rates. The structure of the effective action is similar to the theory of linear bosonization of a Fermi surface. As an application, we investigate the hydrodynamic transport of non-Fermi liquid. Analyzing the Boltzmann equation, we obtain a conventional hydrodynamic transport regime and a tomographic transport regime. In both regimes, the conductance of the system in finite geometry can be a sharp indicator for the soft-mode dynamics and non-Fermi liquid physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Stean (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to that for a general QECC. In the extension, instead of the classical decoders of the linear classical codes that define the CSS code, we use decoding measurements of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded.The decoding error depends on the errors of the two decoding measurements and the degree of complementarity of the CQ codes.We then demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, in which we improve decoding errors over previous approaches and further show that the black hole dynamics may be an optimal encoder for quantum information but a poor encoder for classical information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional hybrid quantum circuits perturbed by quenched quasiperiodic (QP) modulations across the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). Considering non-Pisot QP structures, characterized by unbounded fluctuations, allows us to tune the wandering exponent $\beta$ to exceed the Luck bound $\nu \ge 1/(1-\beta)$ for the stability of the MIPT, where $\nu=1.28(2)$. Via robust numerical simulations of random Clifford circuits interleaved with local projective measurements, we find that sufficiently large QP structural fluctuations destabilize the MIPT and induce a flow to a broad family of critical dynamical phase transitions of the infinite QP type that is governed by the wandering exponent, $\beta$. We numerically determine the associated critical properties, including the correlation length exponent consistent with saturating the Luck bound, and a universal activated dynamical scaling with activation exponent $\psi \cong \beta$, finding excellent agreement with the conclusions of real space renormalization group calculations.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity induced by strong electron-exciton coupling in doped atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mechanism to induce superconductivity in atomically thin semiconductors where excitons mediate an effective attraction between electrons. Our model includes interaction effects beyond the paradigm of phonon-mediated superconductivity and connects to the well-established limits of Bose and Fermi polarons. By accounting for the strong-coupling physics of trions, we find that the effective electron-exciton interaction develops a strong frequency and momentum dependence accompanied by the system undergoing an emerging BCS-BEC crossover from weakly bound $s$-wave Cooper pairs to a superfluid of bipolarons. Even at strong-coupling the bipolarons remain relatively light, resulting in critical temperatures of up to 10\% of the Fermi temperature. This renders heterostructures of two-dimensional materials a promising candidate to realize superconductivity at high critical temperatures set by electron doping and trion binding energies.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Supersymmetry and SYK-like models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work challenges the conventional notion that in spacetime dimension higher than one, a supersymmetric Lagrangian invariably consists of purely bosonic terms, purely fermionic terms, as well as boson-fermion mixing terms. By recasting a relativistic Lagrangian in terms of its non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic sectors, we reveal that an ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) supersymmetric Lagrangian can exist without a purely bosonic contribution. Based on this result, we demonstrate a link between higher-dimensional Carrollian and (0+1)-dimensional quantum mechanical models, yielding higher-order extensions of supersymmetric SYK models in which purely bosonic higher order terms are absent. Given that supersymmetry plays an essential role in improving the quantum behavior and solubility, our findings may lead to interesting applications in non-AdS holography.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ have identified a bilayer (2222) structure and an unexpected alternating monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, both of which feature signatures of superconductivity near 80 K under high pressures. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we measure the electronic structure of 1313 samples. In contrast to the previously studied 2222 structure, we find that the 1313 structure hosts a flat band with a markedly different binding energy, as well as an additional electron pocket and band splittings. By comparison to local-density approximation calculations, we find renormalizations of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived bands to be about 5 to 7 and about 4 respectively, suggesting strong correlation effects. These results reveal important differences in the electronic structure brought about by the distinct structural motifs with the same stoichiometry. Such differences may be relevant to the putative high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Dual-isometric Projected Entangled Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>

      <title>Non-Unitary Quantum Many-Body Dynamics using the Faber Polynomial Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient numerical methods are still lacking to probe the unconventional dynamics of quantum many-body systems under non-unitary evolution. In this work, we use Faber polynomials to numerically simulate both the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems and the quantum jumps unravelling of the Lindblad dynamics. We apply the method to the non-interacting and interacting Hatano-Nelson models evolving from two different setups: i) a N\'eel state, and ii) a domain wall. In the first case, we study how interactions preserve the initial magnetic order against the skin effect. In the second example, we present numerical evidence of the existence of an effective hydrodynamic description for the domain-wall melting problem in the non-interacting limit. Additionally, we investigate both the conditional and unconditional dynamics of the quantum jump unravelling in two quantum spin chains, which exhibit either the non-Hermitian or the Liouvillian skin effect. This numerical method inherently generalises the well-established method based on Chebyshev polynomials to accommodate non-Hermitian scenarios.</description>

      <title>Giant caloric effects in spin chain materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The giant electro- and elasto-caloric effects in spin chain materials are predicted. The theory is based on the exact quantum mechanical solution of the problem. It is shown that the giant jumps in the entropy and the temperature caused by the caloric effect are weakly affected by the initial temperature. The effect can be used for the cooling of new quantum devices (like systems of qubits in quantum computers). On the other hand, since large changes are predicted in the narrow neighborhood of the critical point, the predicted effect can be used in ultra-sensitive electric and stress sensors for modern microelectronics.</description>
