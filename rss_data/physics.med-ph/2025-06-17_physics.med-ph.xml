      <title>Accuracy and Precision of Random Walk with Barrier Model Fitting: Simulations and Applications in Head and Neck Cancers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promising results have been reported in quantifying microstructural parameters (free diffusivity, cell size, and membrane permeability) in head and neck cancers (HNCs) using time-dependent diffusion MRI fitted to Random Walk with Barrier Model (RWBM). However, model fitting remains challenging due to limited number of measurements, low signal-to-noise ratio and complex nonlinear biophysical model. In this work, we comprehensively investigated and elucidated the dependence of RWBM fitting performance on tissue property, data acquisition and processing, and provided insights on improving data acquisition and model fitting. We numerically evaluated the accuracy and precision of RWBM fitting using non-linear least squares as a function of model parameters, noise levels, and maximum effective diffusion times over a wide range of microstructural parameter values. We then elucidated these results by examining the model's degeneracy and fitting landscape. In vivo fitting results on patients with HNCs were analyzed and were interpreted using the numerical results. We observed that free diffusivity estimates were accurate and precise over a wide range of microstructural parameters, whereas the accuracy and precision of surface-to-volume ratio and membrane permeability depended on the values of the parameters. In addition, a maximum effective diffusion time of 200 ms provided the lowest bias and variance in membrane permeability estimations. By fitting to the short-time limit expression, we observed that the variance of parameter estimation was reduced, and that a more accurate and precise estimation of membrane permeability was achieved. In vivo fitting results were consistent with the numerical findings. In conclusion, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of RWBM fitting in clinical settings and has the potential to guide further optimizations of data acquisition and model fitting methods.</description>

      <title>Fractional order derivative approach of viscoelastic behavior of tropical wood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For some time now, wood has offered itself as an alternative to other modern construction materials, and has become the material of choice for structures, mainly because of its renewable nature, durability and ease of shaping. However, once in service, even at room temperature and under low stresses, it deforms and faces the problems of creep and recovery. The aims of this work is to model and predict the viscoelastic deformations of tropical wood by a rheological approach based on fractional calculus theory. Frist, Zener fractional model was used to elucidate these phenomena. The simulations show that the proposed model fit the creep experimental data with an average reliability of 96% and the recovery process with a reliability of 99%. The optimal parameters of this model, determined through an optimization algorithm, exhibit sensitivity to the stress level. To address this issue and enhance the predictive capability of the model, nonlinearities are incorporated into the fractional model, resulting in modified versions that remain applicable across various stress levels.</description>

      <title>First Positronium Lifetime Imaging with Scandium-44 on a Long Axial Field-of-view PET/CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13460v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: 44Sc has been successfully produced, synthesized, labeled and first-in-human studies were conducted some years ago. The decay properties of 44Sc, together with being close to a clinical implementation, make it an ideal candidate for in vivo positronium lifetime measurements. In this study, we investigate the count statistics for ortho-positronium (oPs) measurements with 44Sc.
  Method: A NEMA image quality phantom was filled with 41.7 MBq of 44Sc dissolved in water and scanned on a commercial long-axial field-of-view PET/CT. Three-photon events were identified using a prototype feature of the scanner and dedicated software. The lifetime of oPs was determined in the phantom spheres and in 4x4x4 mm^3 voxels.
  Results: All measured oPs lifetimes are compatible, within the uncertainties, with the literature values for water. The oPs lifetime is 2.65+-0.50, 1.39+-0.20 and 1.76+-0.18 ns in the three smallest spheres of the phantom and 1.79+-0.57 ns for a single voxel in the central region of the largest sphere. The relative standard deviation in the background regions of the time difference distributions, i.e., for time differences smaller than -2.7 ns, is above 20% - even for voxels inside the phantom spheres.
  Conclusions: Despite the favorable physical properties of 44Sc, the count statistics of three-photon events remains a challenge. The high prompt-photon energy causes a significant amount of random three-photon coincidences with the given methodology and, therefore, increases the statistical uncertainties on the measured oPs lifetime.</description>

      <title>Let's play POLO: Integrating the probability of lesion origin into proton treatment plan optimization for low-grade glioma patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In proton therapy of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients, contrast-enhancing brain lesions (CEBLs) on magnetic resonance imaging are considered predictive of late radiation-induced lesions. From the observation that CEBLs tend to concentrate in regions of increased dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET) and proximal to the ventricular system, the probability of lesion origin (POLO) model has been established as a multivariate logistic regression model for the voxel-wise probability prediction of the CEBL origin. To date, leveraging the predictive power of the POLO model for treatment planning relies on hand tuning the dose and LET distribution to minimize the resulting probability predictions. In this paper, we therefore propose automated POLO model-based treatment planning by directly integrating POLO calculation and optimization into plan optimization for LGG patients. We introduce an extension of the original POLO model including a volumetric correction factor, and a model-based optimization scheme featuring a linear reformulation of the model together with feasible optimization functions based on the predicted POLO values. The developed framework is implemented in the open-source treatment planning toolkit matRad. Our framework can generate clinically acceptable treatment plans while automatically taking into account outcome predictions from the POLO model. It also supports the definition of customized POLO model-based objective and constraint functions. Optimization results from a sample LGG patient show that the POLO model-based outcome predictions can be minimized under expected shifts in dose, LET, and POLO distributions, while sustaining target coverage ($\Delta_{\text{PTV}} \text{d95}_{RBE,fx}\approx{0.03}$, $\Delta_{\text{GTV}} \text{d95}_{RBE,fx}\approx{0.001}$), even at large NTCP reductions of $\Delta{\text{NTCP}}\approx{26}\%$.</description>

      <title>Towards real-time additive-free dopamine detection at $10^{-8}$ mM with hardware accelerated platform integrated on camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracing physiological neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA) with detection limits down to $\mathrm{1\times10^{-8}}$ mM is a critical goal in neuroscience for studying brain functions and progressing the understanding of cerebral disease. Addressing this problem requires enhancing the current state-of-the-art additive-free electrochemical workstation methods by over two orders of magnitude. In this work, we implement an ultra-sensitive, additive-free platform exploiting suitably engineered light-scattering membranes and optical accelerators integrated into commercial vision cameras, reporting real-time detection of DA in uric and ascorbic acid below the concentration of $\mathrm{10^{-8}}$ mM. These performances improve the current best technology by over two orders of magnitude in resolution while providing continuous, real-time detection at video rates. This technology also upgrades the bulk form factor of an electrochemical workstation with an imaging camera's compact and portable footprint. The optical accelerator implemented in this work is universal and trainable to detect a wide range of biological analytes. This technology's wide adoption could help enable early disease detection and personalized treatment adjustments while improving the management of neurological, mental, and immune-related conditions.</description>

      <title>A robust and scalable framework for hallucination detection in virtual tissue staining and digital pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Histopathological staining of human tissue is essential for disease diagnosis. Recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in traditional histochemical staining processes, permitting multiplexed staining and tissue preservation. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical uses of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images by experts can be subjective. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method, AQuA, for virtual tissue staining and digital pathology. AQuA autonomously achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to histochemically stained ground truth, and presents an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists, including identifying realistic-looking images that could mislead diagnosticians. We demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained human tissue images. This framework enhances the reliability of virtual tissue staining and provides autonomous quality assurance for image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed DeepCT: Sinogram Wavelet Decomposition Meets Masked Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion model shows remarkable potential on sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction. However, when a network is trained on a limited sample space, its generalization capability may be constrained, which degrades performance on unfamiliar data. For image generation tasks, this can lead to issues such as blurry details and inconsistencies between regions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Sinogram-based Wavelet random decomposition And Random mask diffusion Model (SWARM) for SVCT reconstruction. Specifically, introducing a random mask strategy in the sinogram effectively expands the limited training sample space. This enables the model to learn a broader range of data distributions, enhancing its understanding and generalization of data uncertainty. In addition, applying a random training strategy to the high-frequency components of the sinogram wavelet enhances feature representation and improves the ability to capture details in different frequency bands, thereby improving performance and robustness. Two-stage iterative reconstruction method is adopted to ensure the global consistency of the reconstructed image while refining its details. Experimental results demonstrate that SWARM outperforms competing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative performance across various datasets.</description>
