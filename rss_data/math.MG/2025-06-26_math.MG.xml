      <title>Asymmetric SICs over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zauner's conjecture concerns the existence of $d^2$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$; such a system of lines is known as a SIC. In this paper, we construct infinitely many new SICs over finite fields. While all previously known SICs exhibit Weyl--Heisenberg symmetry, some of our new SICs exhibit trivial automorphism groups. We conjecture that such \textit{totally asymmetric} SICs exist in infinitely many dimensions in the finite field setting.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Landscape and Erosion Distances for Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes connections between three of the most prominent metrics used in the analysis of persistence diagrams in topological data analysis: the bottleneck distance, Patel's erosion distance, and Bubenik's landscape distance. Our main result shows that the erosion and landscape distances are equal, thereby bridging the former's natural category-theoretic interpretation with the latter's computationally convenient structure. The proof utilizes the category with a flow framework of de Silva et al., and leads to additional insights into the structure of persistence landscapes. Our equivalence result is applied to prove several results on the geometry of the erosion distance. We show that the erosion distance is not a length metric, and that its intrinsic metric is the bottleneck distance. We also show that the erosion distance does not coarsely embed into any Hilbert space, even when restricted to persistence diagrams arising from degree-0 persistent homology. Moreover, we show that erosion distance agrees with bottleneck distance on this subspace, so that our non-embeddability theorem generalizes several results in the recent literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a subspace $A$ of a coarse $PD(n)$ metric space $X$ coarsely separates it, then it must have asymptotic dimension at least $n-1$.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Bounds for Persistent Laplacian Eigenvalues under One-Simplex Insertions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent Laplacians are matrix operators that track how the shape and structure of data transform across scales and are popularly adopted in biology, physics, and machine learning. Their eigenvalues are concise descriptors of geometric and topological features in a filtration. Although earlier work established global algebraic stability for these operators, the precise change in a single eigenvalue when one simplex, such as a vertex, edge, or triangle, is added has remained unknown. This is important because downstream tools, including heat-kernel signatures and spectral neural networks, depend directly on these eigenvalues. We close this gap by proving a uniform Lipschitz bound: after inserting one simplex, every up-persistent Laplacian eigenvalue can vary by at most twice the Euclidean norm of that simplex's boundary, independent of filtration scale and complex size. This result delivers the first eigenvalue-level robustness guarantee for spectral topological data analysis. It guarantees that spectral features remain stable under local updates and enables reliable error control in dynamic data settings.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of synthetic null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a synthetic framework for the geometric and analytic study of null (lightlike) hypersurfaces in non-smooth spacetimes. Drawing from optimal transport and recent advances in Lorentzian geometry and causality theory, we define a \emph{synthetic null hypersurface} as a triple $(H, G, \mathfrak{m})$: $H$ is a closed achronal set in a topological causal space, $G$ is a gauge function encoding affine parametrizations along null generators, and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a Radon measure serving as a synthetic analog of the rigged measure. This generalizes classical differential geometric structures to potentially singular spacetimes.
  A central object is the \emph{synthetic null energy condition} ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$), defined via the concavity of an entropy power functional along optimal transport, with parametrization given by the gauge $G$. This condition is invariant under changes of gauge and measure within natural equivalence classes. It agrees with the classical Null Energy Condition in the smooth setting and it applies to low-regularity spacetimes. A key property of ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$) is the stability under convergence of synthetic null hypersurfaces, inspired by measured Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
  As a first application, we obtain a synthetic version of Hawking's area theorem. Moreover, we extend the celebrated Penrose's singularity theorem to continuous spacetimes and prove the existence of trapped regions in the general setting of topological causal spaces satisfying the synthetic ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$).</description>
