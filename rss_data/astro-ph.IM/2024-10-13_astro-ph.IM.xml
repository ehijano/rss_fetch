      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this third installment of SETI in 20xx, we very briefly and subjectively review developments in SETI in 2022. Our primary focus is 80 papers and books published or made public in 2022, which we sort into six broad categories: results from actual searches, new search methods and instrumentation, target and frequency selection, the development of technosignatures, theory of ETIs, and social aspects of SETI.</description>

      <title>Test results of the optical calibration system for the Large Sized Telescope camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018 the Large Sized Telescope (LST-1) prototype, designed to be the lowest energy detector for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, was inaugurated at the Observatorio de Roque de Los Muchachos in La Palma, Canary Island and today three more are under construction, LST2-4. The LST camera, with 1855 photomultipliers (PMTs), requires precise and regular calibration. The camera calibration system (hereafter CaliBox), installed at the center of the telescope mirror dish, is equipped with a Q-switching 355 nm UV laser corresponding to the wavelength at which the maximum camera PMT quantum efficiency is achieved, a set of filters to guarantee a large dynamic range of photons on each camera pixel, and a Ulbricht sphere to spread uniformly the laser light over the camera plane 28 m away. The system is managed by an ODROID-C1+ single board computer that communicates through an Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPCUA) protocol to the camera. The CaliBox is designed to fulfill the requirements needed for the calibration of the camera including the monitor of the photon flux to guarantee the quality of the CaliBox system of laser stability, uniform illumination and intensity range. In this paper, we present in detail the optical system, the monitor of the photon flux, the relevant electronic to monitor the device. The performance of the device, photon flux monitor, evaluation of the photon flux sent to the camera obtained during tests performed in Laboratory are shown.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Energy Modular Array (HEMA) is one of three instruments that compose the STROBE-X mission concept. The HEMA is a large-area, high-throughput non-imaging pointed instrument based on the Large Area Detector developed as part of the LOFT mission concept. It is designed for spectral timing measurements of a broad range of sources and provides a transformative increase in sensitivity to X-rays in the energy range of 2--30 keV compared to previous instruments, with an effective area of 3.4 m$^{2}$ at 8.5 keV and an energy resolution of better than 300 eV at 6 keV in its nominal field of regard.</description>

      <title>Simplified model(s) of the GRAVITY+ adaptive optics system(s) for performance prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the GRAVITY+ upgrade, the adaptive optics (AO) systems of the GRAVITY interferometer are undergoing a major lifting. The current CILAS deformable mirrors (DM, 90 actuators) will be replaced by ALPAO kilo-DMs (43x43, 1432 actuators). On top of the already existing 9x9 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors (SH-WFS) for infrared (IR) natural guide star (NGS), new 40x40 SH-WFSs for visible (VIS) NGS will be deployed. Lasers will also be installed on the four units of the Very Large Telescope to provide a laser guide star (LGS) option with 30x30 SH-WFSs and with the choice to either use the 9x9 IR-WFSs or 2x2 VIS-WFSs for low order sensing. Thus, four modes will be available for the GRAVITY+ AO system (GPAO): IR-NGS, IR-LGS, VIS-NGS and VIS-LGS. To prepare the instrument commissioning and help the observers to plan their observations, a tool is needed to predict the performances of the different modes and for different observing conditions (NGS magnitude, science object magnitude, turbulence conditions...) We developed models based on a Mar{\'e}chal approximation to predict the Strehl ratio of the four GPAO modes in order to feed the already existing tool that simulates the GRAVITY performances. Waiting for commissioning data, our model was validated and calibrated using the TIPTOP toolbox, a Point Spread Function simulator based on the computation of Power Spectrum Densities. In this work, we present our models of the NGS modes of GPAO and their calibration with TIPTOP.</description>

      <title>Content-Based Image Retrieval Using COSFIRE Descriptors with application to Radio Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The morphologies of astronomical sources are highly complex, making it essential not only to classify the identified sources into their predefined categories but also to determine the sources that are most similar to a given query source. Image-based retrieval is essential, as it allows an astronomer with a source under study to ask a computer to sift through the large archived database of sources to find the most similar ones. This is of particular interest if the source under study does not fall into a "known" category (anomalous). Our work uses the trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter Responses) approach for image retrieval. COSFIRE filters are automatically configured to extract the hyperlocal geometric arrangements that uniquely describe the morphological characteristics of patterns of interest in a given image; in this case astronomical sources. This is achieved by automatically examining the shape properties of a given prototype source in an image, which ultimately determines the selectivity of a COSFIRE filter. We further utilize hashing techniques, which are efficient in terms of required computation and storage, enabling scalability in handling large data sets in the image retrieval process. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by conducting experiments on a benchmark data set of radio galaxies, containing 1,180 training images and 404 test images. Notably, our approach achieved a mean average precision of 91% for image retrieval, surpassing the performance of the competing DenseNet-based method. Moreover, the COSFIRE filters are significantly more computationally efficient, requiring $\sim\!14\times$ fewer operations than the DenseNet-based method.</description>

      <title>A test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. I. Galactic white-dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors will be sensitive to millions and resolve tens of thousands of stellar-mass binary systems at mHz frequencies. The vast majority of these will be double white dwarfs in our Galaxy. The greatest part will remain unresolved, forming an incoherent stochastic foreground signal. Using state-of-the-art Galactic models for the formation and evolution of binary white dwarfs and accurate LISA simulated signals, we introduce a test for foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. We explain the former with a new analytical modulation induced by the LISA constellation motion and the intrinsic anisotropy of the source distribution. By demodulating the foreground signal, we reveal a deviation from Gaussianity in the 2-10 mHz frequency band. Our finding is crucial to design faithful data models, i.e. unbiased likelihoods for both individual sources and astrophysical foregrounds parameter estimation, and ultimately for an accurate interpretation of the LISA data.</description>

      <title>CAVITY: Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY. I. First public data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) is a legacy project aimed at characterising the population of galaxies inhabiting voids, which are the most under-dense regions of the cosmic web, located in the Local Universe. This paper describes the first public data release (DR1) of CAVITY, comprising science-grade optical data cubes for the initial 100 out of a total of $\sim$300 galaxies in the Local Universe ($0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.050$). These data were acquired using the integral-field spectrograph PMAS/PPak mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto observatory. The DR1 galaxy sample encompasses diverse characteristics in the color-magnitude space, morphological type, stellar mass, and gas ionisation conditions, providing a rich resource for addressing key questions in galaxy evolution through spatially resolved spectroscopy. The galaxies in this study were observed with the low-resolution V500 set-up, spanning the wavelength range 3745-7500 \AA, with a spectral resolution of 6.0 \AA (FWHM). Here, we describe the data reduction and characteristics and data structure of the CAVITY datasets essential for their scientific utilisation, highlighting such concerns as vignetting effects, as well as the identification of bad pixels and management of spatially correlated noise. We also provide instructions for accessing the CAVITY datasets and associated ancillary data through the project's dedicated database.</description>

      <title>Cyclostationary signals in LISA: a practical application to Milky Way satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) anticipated to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are Galactic double white dwarf binaries (DWDs). However, most of these binaries will be unresolved, and their GWs will overlap incoherently, creating a stochastic noise known as the Galactic foreground. Similarly, the population of unresolved systems in the Milky Way's (MW) satellites is expected to contribute to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Due to their anisotropy and the annual motion of the LISA constellation, both the Galactic foreground and the satellite SGWB fall into the category of cyclostationary processes. Leveraging this property, we develop a purely frequency-based method to study LISA's capability to detect the MW foreground and SGWBs from the most promising MW satellites. We analyze both mock data generated by an astrophysically motivated SGWB spectrum, and realistic ones from a DWD population generated via binary population synthesis. We are able to recover or put constrains on the candidate foregrounds, reconstructing -- in the presence of noise uncertainties -- their sky distribution and spectrum. Our findings highlight the significance of the interplay between the astrophysical spectrum and LISA's sensitivity to detect the satellites' SGWB. Considering an astrophysically motivated prior on the satellite positions improves their detectability, which becomes otherwise challenging in the presence of the Galactic foreground. Furthermore, we explore the potential to observe a hypothetical satellite located behind the Galactic disk. Our results suggest that a Large Magellanic Cloud-like satellite could indeed be observable by LISA.</description>

      <title>Front-End ASIC for the STROBE-X HEMA and WFM Detectors: Concept and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the NSX front-end ASIC, being developed to read charge signals from the HEMA and WFM X-ray detectors for the STROBE-X mission. The ASIC reads out signals from up to 64 anodes of linear Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs). When unloaded, the ASIC channel has a charge resolution, expressed in Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC) of about 2.8 e-. Once connected to the SDD anode we anticipate, for the 80 keV energy range, a ENC of about 10.7 e- at a leakage current of 2 pA, which corresponds to a FWHM of about 145 eV at 6 keV once the Fano-limited statistics from charge generation in Si is included. The acquisition is event-triggered and, for events exceeding the threshold, the ASIC measures the peak amplitude and stores it in an analog memory for subsequent readout. The ASIC can also force the measurement of the sub-threshold channels neighboring the triggered channel, including the ones that belong to neighbor chips by using bi-directional differential inter-chip communication. Alternatively, the ASIC can measure the amplitudes of all channels at the time of the first detected peak. Additional features include a high-resolution option, channel power down and skip function, a low-noise pulse generator, a temperature sensor, and the monitoring of the channel analog output and trimmed threshold. The power consumption of the individual channel is ~590 $\mu$W and, when including all shared circuits, it averages to ~670 $\mu$W / channel.</description>

      <title>Blind and robust reconstruction of adaptive optics point spread functions for asteroid deconvolution and moon detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initially designed to detect and characterize exoplanets, extreme adaptive optics systems (AO) open a new window on the solar system by resolving its small bodies. Nonetheless, despite the always increasing performances of AO systems, the correction is not perfect, degrading their image and producing a bright halo that can hide faint and close moons. Using a reference point spread function (PSF) is not always sufficient due to the random nature of the turbulence. In this work, we present our method to overcome this limitation. It blindly reconstructs the AO-PSF directly in the data of interest, without any prior on the instrument nor the asteroid's shape. This is done by first estimating the PSF core parameters under the assumption of a sharp-edge and flat object, allowing the image of the main body to be deconvolved. Then, the PSF faint extensions are reconstructed with a robust penalization optimization, discarding outliers on-the-fly such as cosmic rays, defective pixels and moons. This allows to properly model and remove the asteroid's halo. Finally, moons can be detected in the residuals, using the reconstructed PSF and the knowledge of the outliers learned with the robust method. We show that our method can be easily applied to different instruments (VLT/SPHERE, Keck/NIRC2), efficiently retrieving the features of AO-PSFs. Compared with state-of-the-art moon enhancement algorithms, moon signal is greatly improved and our robust detection method manages to discriminate faint moons from outliers.</description>

      <title>In-ice Askaryan Emission from Air Showers: Implications for Radio Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08615</link>

Abstract: One of the most promising techniques for detecting ultra-high energy neutrinos involves the use of radio antennas to observe the 10-1000 MHz radiation generated by the showers that neutrinos induce in large volumes of ice. The expected neutrino detection rates of one neutrino or less per detector station per 10 years make the characterization of backgrounds a priority. The largest natural background comes from ultra-high energy cosmic rays which are orders of magnitude more abundant than neutrinos. Particularly crucial is the understanding of geometries in which substantial energy of the cosmic-ray-induced air shower is deposited in the ice giving rise to a compact in-ice shower close to the ice surface. We calculated the radio emission of air-shower cores using the novel CORSIKA 8 code and found it to be similar to the predictions for neutrino-induced showers. For the first time, we calculated the detection rates for O(100m) deep antennas yielding 10-100 detections per year and detector station, which makes this a useful calibration source as these downward-going signals can be differentiated from neutrino-induced showers based on the signal arrival direction. However, the presence of reflection layers in the ice confuses the arrival directions, which makes this a potentially important background. We review the existing information on reflecting layers in the South Pole glacier and, for the first time, quantify the corresponding rate of reflected air-shower signals for the proposed IceCube-Gen2 radio array and discuss mitigation strategies. The reflectivity of the layers is the dominant uncertainty resulting in rate predictions of much less than one detection to several detections per year for IceCube-Gen2 if not mitigated.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Denoising and Merger Time Prediction By Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mergers of massive black hole binaries could generate rich electromagnetic emissions, which allow us to probe the environments surrounding these massive black holes and gain deeper insights into the high energy astrophysics. However, due to the short timescale of binary mergers, it is crucial to predict the time of the merger in advance to devise detailed observational plans. The significant noise and the slow accumulation of signal-to-noise ratio in the inspiral phase make this task particularly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep neural denoising network in this study, capable of denoising continuous inspiral phase signals lasting up to 30 days. Following the denoising process, we perform the detection and merger time prediction based on the denoised signals. Our results demonstrate that for inspiral phase data with a signal-to-noise ratio between 10 and 50 occurring no more than 10 days before the merger, our prediction error for the merger time is generally within 24 hours.</description>

      <title>Distribution-free uncertainty quantification for inverse problems: application to weak lensing mass mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inverse problems, distribution-free uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to obtain error bars with coverage guarantees that are independent of any prior assumptions about the data distribution. In the context of mass mapping, uncertainties could lead to errors that affects our understanding of the underlying mass distribution, or could propagate to cosmological parameter estimation, thereby impacting the precision and reliability of cosmological models. Current surveys, such as Euclid or Rubin, will provide new weak lensing datasets of very high quality. Accurately quantifying uncertainties in mass maps is therefore critical to perform reliable cosmological parameter inference. In this paper, we extend the conformalized quantile regression (CQR) algorithm, initially proposed for scalar regression, to inverse problems. We compare our approach with another distribution-free approach based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS). Both methods are based on a calibration dataset, and offer finite-sample coverage guarantees that are independent of the data distribution. Furthermore, they are applicable to any mass mapping method, including blackbox predictors. In our experiments, we apply UQ on three mass-mapping method: the Kaiser-Squires inversion, iterative Wiener filtering, and the MCALens algorithm. Our experiments reveal that RCPS tends to produce overconservative confidence bounds with small calibration sets, whereas CQR is designed to avoid this issue. Although the expected miscoverage rate is guaranteed to stay below a user-prescribed threshold regardless of the mass mapping method, selecting an appropriate reconstruction algorithm remains crucial for obtaining accurate estimates, especially around peak-like structures, which are particularly important for inferring cosmological parameters. Additionally, the choice of mass mapping method influences the size of the error bars.</description>

      <title>A test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. II. Extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are key observational targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Unresolvable EMRI signals contribute to forming a gravitational wave background (GWB). Characterizing the statistical features of the GWB from EMRIs is of great importance, as EMRIs will ubiquitously affect large segments of the inference scheme. In this work, we apply a frequentist test for GWB Gaussianity and stationarity, exploring three astrophysically-motivated EMRI populations. We construct the resulting signal by combining state-of-the-art EMRI waveforms and a detailed description of the LISA response with time-delay interferometric variables. Depending on the brightness of the GWB, our analysis demonstrates that the resultant EMRI foregrounds show varying degrees of departure from the usual statistical assumptions that the GWBs are both Gaussian and Stationary. If the GWB is non-stationary with non-Gaussian features, this will challenge the robustness of Gaussian-likelihood model, when applied to global inference results, e.g. foreground estimation, background detection, and individual-source parameters reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Path-minimizing Latent ODEs for improved extrapolation and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent ODE models provide flexible descriptions of dynamic systems, but they can struggle with extrapolation and predicting complicated non-linear dynamics. The latent ODE approach implicitly relies on encoders to identify unknown system parameters and initial conditions, whereas the evaluation times are known and directly provided to the ODE solver. This dichotomy can be exploited by encouraging time-independent latent representations. By replacing the common variational penalty in latent space with an $\ell_2$ penalty on the path length of each system, the models learn data representations that can easily be distinguished from those of systems with different configurations. This results in faster training, smaller models, more accurate interpolation and long-time extrapolation compared to the baseline ODE models with GRU, RNN, and LSTM encoder/decoders on tests with damped harmonic oscillator, self-gravitating fluid, and predator-prey systems. We also demonstrate superior results for simulation-based inference of the Lotka-Volterra parameters and initial conditions by using the latents as data summaries for a conditional normalizing flow. Our change to the training loss is agnostic to the specific recognition network used by the decoder and can therefore easily be adopted by other latent ODE models.</description>

      <title>Revised Point-Spread Functions for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present revised point-spread functions (PSFs) for the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). These PSFs provide a robust estimate of the light diffracted by the meshes holding the entrance and focal plane filters and the light that is diffusely scattered over medium- to long-distance by the micro-roughness of the mirrors. We first calibrate the diffracted light using flare images. Our modeling of the diffracted light provides reliable determinations of the mesh parameters and finds that about 24 to 33% of the collected light is diffracted, depending on the AIA channel. Then, we fit for the diffuse scattered light using partially lunar occulted images. We find that the diffuse scattered light can be modeled as a superposition of two power law functions that scatter light over the entire length of the detector. The amount of diffuse scattered light ranges from 10 to 35 %, depending on the AIA channel. In total, AIA diffracts and scatters about 40 to 60 % of the collected light over medium to long distances. When correcting for this, bright image regions increase in intensity by about 30 %, dark image regions decrease in intensity by up to 90 %, and the associated differential emission measure analysis of solar features are affected accordingly. Finally, we compare the image reconstructions using our new PSFs to those using the AIA team PSFs and the PSFs of Poduval et al. (2013). We find that our PSFs outperform the others; our PSFs correct well for the flare diffraction pattern and predict accurately the long-distance scattered light in lunar occultations.</description>

      <title>A neural network-based gravitational wave interpolant with applications to low-latency analyses</title>

Abstract: Matched-filter based gravitational-wave search pipelines identify candidate events within seconds of their arrival on Earth, offering a chance to guide electromagnetic follow-up and observe multi-messenger events. Understanding the detectors' response to an astrophysical transient across the searched signal manifold is paramount to inferring the parameters of the progenitor and deciding which candidates warrant telescope time. We describe a framework that uses artificial neural networks to interpolate gravitational waves and, equivalently, the signal-to noise ratio (SNR) across sufficiently local patches of the signal manifold. Our machine-learning based model generates a single waveform in 6 milliseconds on a CPU and 0.4 milliseconds on a GPU. When using a GPU to generate batches of waveforms simultaneously, we find that we can produce $10^4$ waveforms in $\lesssim 1$ ms. This is achieved while remaining faithful, on average, to 1 part in $10^4$ (1 part in $10^5$) for binary black hole (binary neutron star) waveforms. The model we present is designed to directly utilize intermediate detection pipeline outputs in the hopes of facilitating a better real-time understanding of gravitational-wave candidates.</description>

      <title>Impact of Correlations on the Modeling and Inference of Beyond Vacuum-GR Effects in Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gravitational-wave astronomy, extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral (EMRI) sources for the upcoming LISA observatory have the potential to serve as high-precision probes of astrophysical environments in galactic nuclei, and of potential deviations from general relativity (GR). Such ``beyond vacuum-GR'' effects are often modeled as perturbations to the evolution of vacuum EMRIs under GR. Previous studies have reported unprecedented constraints on these effects by examining the inference of one effect at a time. However, a more realistic analysis would require the simultaneous inference of multiple beyond vacuum-GR effects. The parameters describing such effects are generally significantly correlated with each other and the vacuum EMRI parameters. We explicitly show how these correlations remain even if any modeled effect is absent in the actual signal, and how they cause inference bias when any effect in the signal is absent in the analysis model. This worsens the overall measurability of the whole parameter set, challenging the constraints found by previous studies, and posing a general problem for the modeling and inference of beyond vacuum-GR effects in EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the continuum radiative transfer problem inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the continuum radiative transfer problem inside circumstellar envelopes is both a theoretical and numerical challenge, especially in the frequency-dependent and multi-dimensional case. While approximate methods are easier to handle numerically, they often fail to accurately describe the radiation field inside complex geometries. For these cases, it is necessary to directly solve numerically the radiative transfer equation. We investigate the accuracy of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM hereafter) applied to the frequency-dependent two dimensional radiative transfer equation, coupled with the radiative equilibrium equation, inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. The DGFEM is a variant of finite element methods. It employs discontinuous elements and flux integrals along their boundaries, ensuring local conservation. However, as opposed to the classical finite-element methods, the solution is discontinuous across element edges. We implemented the method in a code and tested its accuracy by comparing our results with the benchmarks from the literature. For all the tested cases, the temperature profile agrees within one percent. Additionally, the emerging spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images, obtained subsequently by ray-tracing techniques from the DGFEM solution, agree on average within $5~\mathrm{\%}$ and $10~\mathrm{\%}$, respectively. We show that the DGFEM can accurately describe the temperature profile inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. Consecutively the emerging SEDs and images are also well reproduced. The discontinuous Galerkin finite element method provides an alternative method (other than Monte Carlo methods for instance) for solving the radiative transfer equation, and could be used in cases that are more difficult to handle with the other methods.</description>

      <title>A network of cooler white dwarfs as infrared standards for flux calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate flux calibration of observational data is vital for astrophysics and cosmology because absolute flux uncertainties of stellar standards propagate into scientific results. With the ever higher precision achieved by telescopic missions (e.g. JWST) in the infrared (IR), suitable calibrators are required for this regime. The basis of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) flux scale is defined by model fits of three hot (Teff &gt; 30000 K) hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) white dwarfs, which achieve an accuracy better than 1 per cent at optical wavelengths but falls below this level in the IR range. We present a network of 17 cooler DA white dwarfs with Teff &lt; 20000 K as spectrophotometric flux standards that are equally, if not more, accurate at IR wavelengths. Cooler white dwarfs do not suffer from non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) effects in continuum flux or from UV metal line blanketing, have a larger sky density, are generally closer to Earth with little or negligible interstellar reddening, and have energy distributions peaking in the optical or near-IR. Using the latest grid of DA LTE atmosphere models with three-dimensional (3D) convection, the observed Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer (STIS) and Wide Field Camera three (WFC3) fluxes of our network are accurate to 3 per cent over most of the range 1450 - 16000 AA, with a median standard deviation of 1.41 per cent. Fitting the HST STIS and WFC3 white dwarf SEDs and Balmer lines independently yields SEDs that agree within 3$\sigma$, which demonstrates the precision of the models for our network.</description>
