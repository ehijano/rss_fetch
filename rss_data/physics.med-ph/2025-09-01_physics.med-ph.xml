      <title>Stable electron-irradiated [1-$^{13}$C]alanine radicals for clinically viable metabolic imaging with Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>

Abstract: Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (dDNP) increases the sensitivity of magnetic resonance experiments by $&gt;10^4$-fold, permitting isotopically-labelled molecules to be transiently visible in MRI scans. dDNP requires a source of unpaired electrons in contact with labelled nuclei, cooled to $\sim$1K, and spin-pumped into a given state by microwaves. These electrons are usually chemical radicals, requiring removal by filtration prior to injection into humans. Alternative sources, such as UV irradiation, generate lower polarisation and require cryogenic transport. We present ultra-high-dose-rate electron irradiation as a novel alternative for generating non-persistent radicals in alanine/glycerol mixtures. These are stable for months at room temperature, quench spontaneously upon dissolution, are present in dose-dependent concentrations, and generate comparable nuclear polarisation to trityl radicals used clinically (20\%) through a novel mechanism. This process is inherently sterilising, permitting imaging of alanine metabolism \textit{in vivo}. As well as scientific novelty, this overcomes the biggest barrier to clinically translating dDNP.</description>

      <title>Natural Frequency Dependency of Magneto-Mechanical Resonators on Magnet Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise derivation of physical quantities like temperature or pressure at arbitrary locations is useful in numerous contexts, e.g. medical procedures or industrial process engineering. The novel sensor technology of magneto-mechanical resonators (MMR), based on the interaction of a rotor and stator permanent magnet, allows for the combined tracking of the sensor position and orientation while simultaneously sensing an external measurand. Thereby, the quantity is coupled to the torsional oscillation frequency, e.g. by varying the magnet distance. In this paper, we analyze the (deflection angle-independent) natural frequency dependency of MMR sensors on the rotor-stator distance, and evaluate the performance of theoretical models. The three presented sensors incorporate magnets of spherical and/or cylindrical geometry and can be operated at adjustable frequencies within the range of 61.9-307.3 Hz. Our proposed method to obtain the natural frequency demonstrates notable robustness to variations in the initial deflection amplitudes and quality factors resulting in statistical errors on the mean smaller than 0.05 %. We find that the distance-frequency relationship is well described by an adapted dipole model accounting for material and manufacturing uncertainties. Their combined effect can be compensated by an adjustment of a single parameter which drives the median model deviation generally below 0.2 %. Our depicted methods and results are important for the design and calibration process of new sensor types utilizing the MMR technique.</description>
