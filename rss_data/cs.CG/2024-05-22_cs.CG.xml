      <title>Exact predicates, exact constructions and combinatorics for mesh CSG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a general mesh intersection algorithm that exactly computes the so-called Weiler model and that uses it to implement boolean operations with arbitrary multi-operand expressions, CSG (constructive solid geometry) and some mesh repair operations. From an input polygon soup, the algorithm first computes the co-refinement, with an exact representation of the intersection points. Then, the decomposition of 3D space into volumetric regions (Weiler model) is constructed, by sorting the facets around the non-manifold intersection edges (radial sort), using specialized exact predicates. Finally, based on the input boolean expression, the triangular facets that belong to the boundary of the result are classified. This is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm that computes an exact Weiler model. To implement all the involved predicates and constructions, two geometric kernels are proposed, tested and discussed (arithmetic expansions and multi-precision floating-point). As a guiding principle,the combinatorial information shared between each step is kept as simple as possible. It is made possible by treating all the particular cases in the kernel. In particular, triangles with intersections are remeshed using the (uniquely defined) Constrained Delaunay Triangulation, with symbolic perturbations to disambiguate configurations with co-cyclic points. It makes it easy to discard the duplicated triangles that appear when remeshing overlapping facets. The method is tested and compared with previous work, on the existing "thingi10K" dataset (to test co-refinement and mesh repair) and on a new "thingiCSG" dataset made publicly available (to test the full CSG pipeline) on a variety of interesting examples featuring different types of "pathologies"</description>

      <title>Improved upper bounds for the Heilbronn's Problem for $k$-gons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heilbronn triangle problem asks for the placement of $n$ points in a unit square that maximizes the smallest area of a triangle formed by any three of those points. In $1972$, Schmidt considered a natural generalization of this problem. He asked for the placement of $n$ points in a unit square that maximizes the smallest area of the convex hull formed by any four of those points. He showed a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{-3/2})$, which was improved to $\Omega(n^{-3/2}\log{n})$ by Leffman.
  A trivial upper bound of $3/n$ could be obtained, and Schmidt asked if this could be improved asymptotically. However, despite several efforts, no asymptotic improvement over the trivial upper bound was known for the last $50$ years, and the problem started to get the tag of being notoriously hard. Szemer{\'e}di posed the question of whether one can, at least, improve the constant in this trivial upper bound. In this work, we answer this question by proving an upper bound of $2/n+o(1/n)$. We also extend our results to any convex hulls formed by $k\geq 4$ points.</description>

      <title>Greedy Spanners in Euclidean Spaces Admit Sublinear Separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The greedy spanner in a low dimensional Euclidean space is a fundamental geometric construction that has been extensively studied over three decades as it possesses the two most basic properties of a good spanner: constant maximum degree and constant lightness. Recently, Eppstein and Khodabandeh showed that the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^2$ admits a sublinear separator in a strong sense: any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has a separator of size $O(\sqrt{k})$. Their technique is inherently planar and is not extensible to higher dimensions. They left showing the existence of a small separator for the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any constant $d\geq 3$ as an open problem. In this paper, we resolve the problem of Eppstein and Khodabandeh by showing that any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(k^{1-1/d})$. We introduce a new technique that gives a simple characterization for any geometric graph to have a sublinear separator that we dub $\tau$-lanky: a geometric graph is $\tau$-lanky if any ball of radius $r$ cuts at most $\tau$ edges of length at least $r$ in the graph. We show that any $\tau$-lanky geometric graph of $n$ vertices in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(\tau n^{1-1/d})$. We then derive our main result by showing that the greedy spanner is $O(1)$-lanky. We indeed obtain a more general result that applies to unit ball graphs and point sets of low fractal dimensions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our technique naturally extends to doubling metrics. We use the $\tau$-lanky characterization to show that there exists a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner for doubling metrics of dimension $d$ with a constant maximum degree and a separator of size $O(n^{1-\frac{1}{d}})$; this result resolves an open problem posed by Abam and Har-Peled a decade ago.</description>

      <title>On the Injectivity of Euler Integral Transforms with Hyperplanes and Quadric Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euler characteristic transform (ECT) is an integral transform used widely in topological data analysis. Previous efforts by Curry et al. and Ghrist et al. have independently shown that the ECT is injective on all compact definable sets. In this work, we first study the injectivity of the ECT on definable sets that are not necessarily compact and prove a complete classification of constructible functions that the Euler characteristic transform is not injective on. We then introduce the quadric Euler characteristic transform (QECT) as a natural generalization of the ECT by detecting definable shapes with quadric hypersurfaces rather than hyperplanes. We also discuss some criteria for the injectivity of QECT.</description>

      <title>Two Choices are Enough for P-LCPs, USOs, and Colorful Tangents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide polynomial-time reductions between three search problems from three distinct areas: the P-matrix linear complementarity problem (P-LCP), finding the sink of a unique sink orientation (USO), and a variant of the $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich problem. For all three settings, we show that "two choices are enough", meaning that the general non-binary version of the problem can be reduced in polynomial time to the binary version. This specifically means that generalized P-LCPs are equivalent to P-LCPs, and grid USOs are equivalent to cube USOs. These results are obtained by showing that both the P-LCP and our $\alpha$-Ham Sandwich variant are equivalent to a new problem we introduce, P-Lin-Bellman. This problem can be seen as a new tool for formulating problems as P-LCPs.</description>

      <title>The Quantitative Fractional Helly theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two celebrated extensions of Helly's theorem are the Fractional Helly theorem of Katchalski and Liu (1979) and the Quantitative Volume theorem of B\'ar\'any, Katchalski, and Pach (1982). Improving on several recent works, we prove an optimal combination of these two results. We show that given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $n$ convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that at least $\alpha \binom{n}{d+1}$ of the $(d+1)$-tuples of $\mathcal{F}$ have an intersection of volume at least 1, then one can select $\Omega_{d,\alpha}(n)$ members of $\mathcal{F}$ whose intersection has volume at least $\Omega_d(1)$.
  Furthermore, with the help of this theorem, we establish a quantitative version of the $(p,q)$ theorem of Alon and Kleitman. Let $p\geq q\geq d+1$ and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that among any $p$ elements of $\mathcal{F}$, there are $q$ that have an intersection of volume at least $1$. Then, we prove that there exists a family $T$ of $O_{p,q}(1)$ ellipsoids of volume $\Omega_d(1)$ such that every member of $\mathcal{F}$ contains at least one element of $T$.
  Finally, we present extensions about the diameter version of the Quantitative Helly theoerm.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Wormhole: Scalable Optimal Transport Distance with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and the related Wasserstein metric (W) are powerful and ubiquitous tools for comparing distributions. However, computing pairwise Wasserstein distances rapidly becomes intractable as cohort size grows. An attractive alternative would be to find an embedding space in which pairwise Euclidean distances map to OT distances, akin to standard multidimensional scaling (MDS). We present Wasserstein Wormhole, a transformer-based autoencoder that embeds empirical distributions into a latent space wherein Euclidean distances approximate OT distances. Extending MDS theory, we show that our objective function implies a bound on the error incurred when embedding non-Euclidean distances. Empirically, distances between Wormhole embeddings closely match Wasserstein distances, enabling linear time computation of OT distances. Along with an encoder that maps distributions to embeddings, Wasserstein Wormhole includes a decoder that maps embeddings back to distributions, allowing for operations in the embedding space to generalize to OT spaces, such as Wasserstein barycenter estimation and OT interpolation. By lending scalability and interpretability to OT approaches, Wasserstein Wormhole unlocks new avenues for data analysis in the fields of computational geometry and single-cell biology.</description>
