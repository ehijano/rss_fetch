      <title>Stabilizing optical solitons by frequency-dependent linear gain-loss and the collisional Raman frequency shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study transmission stabilization of optical solitons against emission of radiation in nonlinear optical waveguides in the presence of weak linear gain-loss, cubic loss, and the collisional Raman frequency shift. We first show how the collisional Raman frequency shift perturbation arises in three different physical setups. We then show by numerical simulations with a perturbed nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) model that transmission in waveguides with weak frequency-independent linear gain is unstable. The radiative instability is stronger than the radiative instabilities that were observed in earlier studies for soliton transmission in the presence of weak linear gain, cubic loss, and various frequency-shifting physical mechanisms. In particular, the Fourier spectrum of the radiation is significantly more spiky and broadband than the radiation's Fourier spectra in earlier studies. Moreover, we demonstrate by numerical simulations with another perturbed NLS model that transmission in waveguides with weak frequency-dependent linear gain-loss, cubic loss, and the collisional Raman frequency shift is stable. Despite the stronger radiative instability in the corresponding waveguide setup with weak linear gain, stabilization occurs via the same generic mechanism that was suggested in earlier studies. More precisely, the collisional Raman frequency shift experienced by the soliton leads to the separation of the soliton's and the radiation's Fourier spectra, while the frequency-dependent linear gain-loss leads to efficient suppression of radiation emission. Thus, our study demonstrates the robustness of the proposed generic soliton stabilization method, which is based on the interplay between perturbation-induced shifting of the soliton's frequency and frequency-dependent linear gain-loss.</description>

      <title>Modal and wave synchronization in coupled self-excited oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to a common synchronization and/or localization behavior, a system of linearly coupled identical bistable Van der Pol (BVdP) oscillators can exhibit a "non-conventional" or "modal" synchronization. In two-DOF case, one can observe stable beatings attractor with synchronized amplitudes of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes. Current study demonstrates that this unusual behavior is generic and quite ubiquitous, if the system is explored in appropriate parametric regime. Indeed, in the absence of the self - excitation the system of coupled linear oscillators possesses a complete set of non-interacting eigenmodes. If the system is symmetric and the coupling is weak enough, appropriate initial conditions will result in a continuous multi-parametric family of stationary beatings or beat waves. If the self-excitation terms are small enough, i.e. even weaker than the weak coupling, one can expect that, generically, some special stationary or wave beatings will turn into the stable attractors. We demonstrate this phenomenon in systems of ring-coupled BVdP oscillators. In particular, we observe simple two-wave synchronization for $N=2,3,5,6,7$ coupled oscillators; for $N=2$ it corresponds to the "modal" synchronization observed previously. The case $N=4$ is special: due to internal resonances in the slow flow, the two-wave synchronization turns unstable, and more complicated patterns of the multi-wave synchronization are revealed. Analytic models manage to capture the shapes of the observed beat waves. All results are verified by direct numeric simulations.</description>

      <title>Extending the FDTD GVADE method nonlinear polarization vector to include anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method [Greene, J. H. and A. Taflove, Opt. Express 14, 8305 (2006)], nonlinear polarization vector is extended to include anisotropy, in nonlinear isotropic media at optical frequencies. The theory is presented for extending the method in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and then simulation results are presented for the simplified 2D transverse magnetic polarization case, revisiting the fused silica example introduced in the 2006 paper including the anisotropic part of the nonlinear polarization vector. The simulation results including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector were compared with isotropic polarization vector simulation results.</description>
