      <title>Impact of High Intensity Long-Duration Continuous Auroral Electrojet Activity (HILDCAAs) on relativistic electrons of the radiation belt of Earth during Van Allen probe era of NASA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of High-intensity Long-Duration Continuous Auroral Electrojet Activity (HILDCAA) on the relativistic electrons in radiation belt of Earth. Utilizing data from Van Allen Probe mission of NASA, we conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis to understand the impact of HILDCAA events on the radiation belt fluxes. The super epoch analysis was carried out to determine the general response of L-shell, pitch angle, and energy-dependency of relativistic electrons to HILDCAAs. The analysis reveals a significant flux enhancement in the relativistic electron fluxes, predominantly occurring with a delay of 0 to 2 days following the onset of HILDCAA events. The general response indicates that the maximum energy of accelerated electrons reaches up to 6 MeV. Additionally, electrons with perpendicular pitch angles exhibit a significantly greater enhancement in flux and achieve higher maximum acceleration energies compared to those with parallel pitch angles. The observed time-delayed and pitch angle-dependent response related to the onset of HILDCAAs highlights the significant influence of wave-particle interactions, particularly in relation to ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves in this context. This is further supported by ground-based magnetometers and in-situ magnetic field observations from the RBSP probe, which demonstrated enhanced power of ULF waves during HILDCAA events. The study strengthens our current understanding of radiation belt particle acceleration processes and has potential implications for satellite operations and other space-based technologies, both on Earth and in the magnetospheres of other planets.</description>

      <title>Dust Acoustic Rogue Waves in a Cometary Environment with kappa Distributed Electrons and Protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged dust is present in almost all astrophysical and laboratory plasma environments. They alter the plasma charge density and also give rise to various modes of electrostatic waves and oscillations. In this paper we study the properties of Dust Acoustic Rogue Waves (DARW) in a cometary environment with positively and negatively charged dust components, kappa distributed - protons and electrons. Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) is derived using reductive perturbation method and analysed for modulational instability. The system is found to be modulationally unstable above some particular value of wave number($k=0.5$), after which the system is unstable. The solution for rogue waves is tested in this environment theoretically. Amplitude and structure of first and second order rogue waves are compared for various plasma parameters. Higher charge number of positive dust, $(z_+ &gt; z_-)$ decreases the amplitude of RWs, while higher number density of positive dust $(n_+&gt;n_-)$ ions increases it. As number density of proton $(n_i)$ increases the amplitude of RW decreases. Peak values increase with number density exponentially for positive and linearly for negative dust ions. It increases linearly with charge number of both positive and negative dust ions. Peak value decreases exponentially for number density of proton.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Different Numerical Methods to Calculate the Pitch-angle Diffusion Coefficient from Full-orbit Simulations: disentangling a rope of sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pitch-angle diffusion coefficient quantifies the effect of pitch-angle scattering on charged particles propagating through turbulent magnetic fields and is a key ingredient in understanding the diffusion of these particles along the background magnetic field. Despite its significance, only a limited number of studies have calculated the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient from test particle simulations in synthetic magnetic turbulence, employing various, often quite different, techniques for this purpose. In this study, we undertake a comparative analysis of nine different methods for calculating the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient from full-orbit simulations. Our objective is to find the strengths and limitations of each method and to determine the most reliable approach. Although all nine methods should theoretically yield comparable results, certain methods may be ill-suited for numerical investigations, while others may not be applicable under conditions of strong turbulence. Through this investigation, we aim to provide recommendations for best practices when employing these methods in future numerical studies of pitch-angle scattering.</description>

      <title>Observation of O+ Characteristics During the Terrestrial Alfv\'en Wing State Induced by the April 2023 Coronal Mass Ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Magnetospheric Multiscale observations of oxygen ions (O+) during a coronal mass ejection in April 2023 when the solar wind was sub-Alfv\'enic and Alfv\'en wings formed. For the first time, O+ characteristics are studied at the contact region between the unshocked solar wind and the magnetosphere. The O+ ions show energies between 100s eV and ~30 keV. The possible sources are the ring current, the warm plasma cloak, and the ionosphere. The O+ ions exhibit bi-directional streaming along newly-formed closed field lines (CFLs), and dominantly anti-parallel on earlier-formed CFLs. Escaping O+ ions in the unshocked solar wind are observed. During the recovery phase, the O+ pitch-angle distribution associated with flux tubes shows dispersion, indicating potential loss to the solar wind. Our results show escaping as well as trapped O+ ions in the region where a magnetic cloud, an Alfv\'en wing, and magnetospheric field lines are mixed.</description>

      <title>Interplanetary Rotation of 2021 December 4 CME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic orientation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is of great importance to understand their space weather effects. Although many evidences suggest that CMEs can undergo significant rotation during the early phases of evolution in the solar corona, there are few reports that CMEs rotate in the interplanetary space. In this work, we use multi-spacecraft observations and a numerical simulation starting from the lower corona close to the solar surface to understand the CME event on 2021 December 4, with an emphatic investigation of its rotation. This event is observed as a partial halo CME from the back side of the Sun by coronagraphs, and reaches the BepiColombo spacecraft and the MAVEN/Tianwen-1 as a magnetic flux rope-like structure. The simulation discloses that in the solar corona the CME is approximately a translational motion, while the interplanetary propagation process evidences a gradual change of axis orientation of the CME's flux rope-like structure. It is also found that the downside and the right flank of the CME moves with the fast solar wind, and the upside does in the slow-speed stream. The different parts of the CME with different speeds generate the nonidentical displacements of its magnetic structure, resulting in the rotation of the CME in the interplanetary space. Furthermore, at the right flank of the CME exists a corotating interaction region (CIR), which makes the orientation of the CME alter, and also deviates from its route due to the CME. These results provide new insight on interpreting CMEs' dynamics and structures during their travelling through the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Rays Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep learning framework using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the spectra of galactic cosmic rays by leveraging historical solar activity data, addressing the limitations of traditional transport models. By incorporating multiple solar parameters, such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The inclusion of historical cosmic-ray data enhances prediction accuracy, making the model highly effective for space weather forecasting. Moreover, it provides reliable one-day-ahead predictions of full spectra of cosmic rays for different species. Our approach surpasses traditional physics-based methods, providing a scalable, data-driven solution for reliable daily and long-term forecasts. This work paves the way for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>
