      <title>The Unit-Zero Divisor Graph of a Commutative Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to associating a graph with a commutative ring. Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity. The unit-zero divisor graph of a commutative ring $R$, denoted by $G_{UZ}(R)$, offers a novel framework for exploring the interaction between ring and graph structures. The vertex set of $G_{UZ}(R)$ consists of all elements of the ring $R$. Two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ in $G_{UZ}(R)$ are adjacent if and only if $x + y$ is a unit and $xy$ is a zero divisor in $R$. This dual adjacency condition gives rise to a graph that reflects both the additive and multiplicative behavior of the ring. This study investigates key structural properties of $G_{UZ}(R)$, including regularity, bipartiteness, planarity, and Hamiltonicity. In addition, it examines how these graph features are influenced by the algebraic structure of the ring, particularly the group of units, the set of zero divisors, ideals, and the Jacobson radical.</description>

      <title>On finite factorization Puiseux algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integral domain $D$ is called a finite factorization domain (FFD) if every nonzero nonunit element of $D$ has only finitely many non-associate divisors. In 1998, for an integral domain $D$ and a cancellative torsion-free monoid $S$ such that each nonzero element of its quotient group is of type $(0,0, \ldots)$, Kim proved that the monoid domain $D[S]$ is an FFD if and only if $D$ is an FFD and $S$ is an FFM. However, it is still open whether a monoid algebra $K[S]$ is an FFD provided that $S$ is a reduced FFM. In this paper, we show that a Puiseux algebra $K[S]$ is an FFD if and only if $S$ is an FFM, when $K$ is a finitely generated field of characteristic $0$. This would provide a large class of one-dimensional monoid algebras with finite factorization property. We also prove that every generalized cyclotomic polynomial has the finite factorization property in $K[S]$ where $S$ is a reduced FFM and $K$ is an arbitrary field of characteristic $0$.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of ideals of minors in free resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00903v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the ideals of minors in minimal free resolutions over local rings. In particular, we prove that such ideals are eventually 2-periodic over complete intersections and Golod rings. We also establish general results on the stable behavior of ideals of minors in any infinite minimal free resolution. These ideals have intimate connections to trace ideals and cohomology annihilators. Constraints on the stable values attained by the ideals of minors in many situations are obtained, and they can be explicitly computed in certain cases.</description>

      <title>The multigraded BGG correspondence in Macaulay2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an overview of a Macaulay2 package for computing with the multigraded BGG correspondence. This software builds on the package BGG due to Abo-Decker-Eisenbud-Schreyer-Smith-Stillman, which concerns the standard graded BGG correspondence. In addition to implementing the multigraded BGG functors, this package includes an implementation of differential modules and their minimal free resolutions, and it contains a method for computing strongly linear strands of multigraded free resolutions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression for Inverse Problems in Linear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a computationally efficient algorithm in system theory for solving inverse problems governed by linear partial differential equations (PDEs). We model solutions of linear PDEs using Gaussian processes with priors defined based on advanced commutative algebra and algebraic analysis. The implementation of these priors is algorithmic and achieved using the Macaulay2 computer algebra software. An example application includes identifying the wave speed from noisy data for classical wave equations, which are widely used in physics. The method achieves high accuracy while enhancing computational efficiency.</description>
