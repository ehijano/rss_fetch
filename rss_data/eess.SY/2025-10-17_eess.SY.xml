      <title>Cyber-Resilient System Identification for Power Grid through Bayesian Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power grids increasingly need real-time situational awareness under the ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape. Advances in snapshot-based system identification approaches have enabled accurately estimating states and topology from a snapshot of measurement data, under random bad data and topology errors. However, modern interactive, targeted false data can stay undetectable to these methods, and significantly compromise estimation accuracy. This work advances system identification that combines snapshot-based method with time-series model via Bayesian Integration, to advance cyber resiliency against both random and targeted false data. Using a distance-based time-series model, this work can leverage historical data of different distributions induced by changes in grid topology and other settings. The normal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system identification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to targeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data, topology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate our method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation error under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and locate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed with the snapshot-based baseline, both taking &lt;1min per time tick on the large 2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU.</description>

      <title>Multi-Period Sparse Optimization for Proactive Grid Blackout Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing or planned power grids need to evaluate survivability under extreme events, like a number of peak load overloading conditions, which could possibly cause system collapses (i.e. blackouts). For realistic extreme events that are correlated or share similar patterns, it is reasonable to expect that the dominant vulnerability or failure sources behind them share the same locations but with different severity. Early warning diagnosis that proactively identifies the key vulnerabilities responsible for a number of system collapses of interest can significantly enhance resilience. This paper proposes a multi-period sparse optimization method, enabling the discovery of {persistent failure sources} across a sequence of collapsed systems with increasing system stress, such as rising demand or worsening contingencies. This work defines persistency and efficiently integrates persistency constraints to capture the ``hidden'' evolving vulnerabilities. Circuit-theory based power flow formulations and circuit-inspired optimization heuristics are used to facilitate the scalability of the method. Experiments on benchmark systems show that the method reliably tracks persistent vulnerability locations under increasing load stress, and solves with scalability to large systems ({on average} taking {around} 200 s per scenario on 2000+ bus systems).</description>

      <title>Dual Detection Framework for Faults and Integrity Attacks in Cyber-Physical Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in the security and safety of cyber-physical control systems, and accurately distinguishing between different anomaly types is crucial for system recovery and mitigation. This study proposes a dual detection framework for anomaly detection and discrimination. By leveraging the dynamic characteristics of control loops and the stealthiness features of integrity attacks, the closed-loop stealthiness condition is first derived, and two dedicated detectors are designed and deployed on the controller side and the plant side, respectively, enabling joint plant fault and cyber attack detection. Moreover, by jointly analyzing the residual response of the two detectors corresponding to different anomalies, it is proved that the proposed method can distinguish between faults and integrity attacks due to the detectors' individual residual spaces. According to the detector's residual space, the fault and attack detection performance is further improved by a two-stage optimization scheme. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>DiffOPF: Diffusion Solver for Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a multi-valued, non-convex mapping from loads to dispatch setpoints. The variability of system parameters (e.g., admittances, topology) further contributes to the multiplicity of dispatch setpoints for a given load. Existing deep learning OPF solvers are single-valued and thus fail to capture the variability of system parameters unless fully represented in the feature space, which is prohibitive. To solve this problem, we introduce a diffusion-based OPF solver, termed \textit{DiffOPF}, that treats OPF as a conditional sampling problem. The solver learns the joint distribution of loads and dispatch setpoints from operational history, and returns the marginal dispatch distributions conditioned on loads. Unlike single-valued solvers, DiffOPF enables sampling statistically credible warm starts with favorable cost and constraint satisfaction trade-offs. We explore the sample complexity of DiffOPF to ensure the OPF solution within a prescribed distance from the optimization-based solution, and verify this experimentally on power system benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Belief Space Control of Safety-Critical Systems Under State-Dependent Measurement Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-critical control is imperative for deploying autonomous systems in the real world. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer strong safety guarantees when accurate system and sensor models are available. However, widely used additive, fixed-noise models are not representative of complex sensor modalities with state-dependent error characteristics. Although CBFs have been designed to mitigate uncertainty using fixed worst-case bounds on measurement noise, this approach can lead to overly-conservative control. To solve this problem, we extend the Belief Control Barrier Function (BCBF) framework to accommodate state-dependent measurement noise via the Generalized Extended Kalman Filter (GEKF) algorithm, which models measurement noise as a linear function of the state. Using the original BCBF framework as baseline, we demonstrate the performance of the BCBF-GEKF approach through simulation results on a 1D single integrator setpoint tracking scenario and 2D unicycle kinematics trajectory tracking scenario. Our results confirm that the BCBF-GEKF approach offers less conservative control with greater safety.</description>

      <title>Resource-Aware Stealthy Attacks in Vehicle Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are transforming modern transportation by enabling cooperative applications such as vehicle platooning, where multiple vehicles travel in close formation to improve efficiency and safety. However, the heavy reliance on inter-vehicle communication makes platoons highly susceptible to attacks, where even subtle manipulations can escalate into severe physical consequences. While existing research has largely focused on defending against attacks, far less attention has been given to stealthy adversaries that aim to covertly manipulate platoon behavior. This paper introduces a new perspective on the attack design problem by demonstrating how attackers can guide platoons toward their own desired trajectories while remaining undetected. We outline conditions under which such attacks are feasible, analyze their dependence on communication topologies and control protocols, and investigate the resources required by the attacker. By characterizing the resources needed to launch stealthy attacks, we address system vulnerabilities and informing the design of resilient countermeasures. Our findings reveal critical weaknesses in current platoon architectures and anomaly detection mechanisms and provide methods to develop more secure and trustworthy CAV systems.</description>

      <title>A Deep State-Space Model Compression Method using Upper Bound on Output Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deep state-space models (Deep SSMs) that contain linear-quadratic-output (LQO) systems as internal blocks and present a compression method with a provable output error guarantee. We first derive an upper bound on the output error between two Deep SSMs and show that the bound can be expressed via the $h^2$-error norms between the layerwise LQO systems, thereby providing a theoretical justification for existing model order reduction (MOR)-based compression. Building on this bound, we formulate an optimization problem in terms of the $h^2$-error norm and develop a gradient-based MOR method. On the IMDb task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, we demonstrate that our compression method achieves strong performance. Moreover, unlike prior approaches, we reduce roughly 80% of trainable parameters without retraining, with only a 4-5% performance drop.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution PTDF-Based Planning of Storage and Transmission Under High Renewables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) optimizes power grid upgrades and investments to ensure reliable, efficient, and cost-effective electricity delivery while addressing grid constraints. To support growing demand and renewable energy integration, energy storage is emerging as a pivotal asset that provides temporal flexibility and alleviates congestion. This paper develops a multiperiod, two-stage PTDF formulation that co-optimizes transmission upgrades and storage siting/sizing. To ensure scalability, a trust-region, multicut Benders scheme warm-started from per-representative-day optima is proposed. Applied to a 2,000-bus synthetic Texas system under high-renewable projections, the method attains final optimality gaps below 1% and yields a plan with storage at about 180 nodes (32% of peak renewable capacity). These results demonstrate that the proposed PTDF-based methodology efficiently handles large distributed storage fleets, demonstrating scalability at high spatial resolution</description>

      <title>A Human-Vector Susceptible--Infected--Susceptible Model for Analyzing and Controlling the Spread of Vector-Borne Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an epidemic model for the spread of vector-borne diseases. The model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium. Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control policy.</description>

      <title>Improved Voltage Regulation with Optimal Design of Decentralized Volt-VAr Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of distributed energy resources has created a need for autonomous, dynamic voltage regulation. Decentralized Volt-VAr Control (VVC) of grid-connected inverters presents a unique opportunity for voltage management but, if designed poorly, can lead to unstable behavior when in feedback with the grid. We model the grid-VVC closed-loop dynamics with a linearized power flow approach, leveraging historical data, which shows improvement over the commonly used LinDistFlow model. This model is used to design VVC slopes by minimizing steady-state voltage deviation from the nominal value, subject to a non-convex spectral radius stability constraint, which has not been previously implemented within this context. We compare this constraint to existing convex restrictions and demonstrate, through simulations on a realistic feeder, that using the spectral radius results in more effective voltage regulation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Key-Aware Co-Simulation Framework for Next Generation of SCADA Systems Encrypted by Quantum-Key-Distribution Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address growing cybersecurity challenges in modern power dispatch systems, this paper proposes a multi-layer modeling and optimization framework for SCADA systems enhanced with quantum key distribution (QKD). While most existing applications of QKD in the power sector focus on building secure point-to-point communication tunnels, they rarely consider the system-level coupling between key dynamics and control scheduling. In contrast, our approach integrates quantum key generation, consumption, inventory prediction, and control latency into a unified model, enabling key-aware reconfiguration of SCADA control chains based on task security demands and real-time resource constraints. To resolve conflicts in key resource allocation between transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs), we formulate a bi-level Stackelberg game and transform it into a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). We further develop an efficient Level Decomposition-Complementarity Pruning (LD-CP) algorithm to solve the problem. To support reproducible evaluation, we build an end-to-end co-simulation platform that integrates physical-layer disruptions via OpenQKD-Sim, Q3P/IEC-104 protocol stack binding, and real-time control-chain monitoring through Grafana. Experimental results on the IEEE 39- and 118-bus systems show that our method increases task success rate by 25%, reduces peak frequency deviation by 70%, and improves key utilization to 83%. This work lays the foundation for future quantum-secure control systems in power grid operations.</description>

      <title>Through-the-Earth Magnetic Induction Communication and Networking: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) communication (MIC) has emerged as a promising candidate for underground communication networks due to its excellent penetration capabilities. Integration with Space-Air-Ground-Underground (SAGUI) networks in next-generation mobile communication systems requires a well-defined network architecture. A recent discovery in MIC research, MI fast fading, remains in its early stages and presents unique challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on through-the-earth (TTE) MIC, covering MI applications, channel modeling, point-to-point MIC design, relay techniques, network frameworks, and emerging technologies. We compare various MIC applications to highlight TTE-specific challenges and review the principles of channel modeling, addressing both MI slow fading and MI fast fading, along with its potential impact on existing MIC theories. We conduct a fine-grained decomposition of MI channel power gain into four distinct physical parameters, and propose a novel geometric model to analyze MI fast fading. We also summarize MI relay techniques, examine crosstalk effects in relay and high-density networks, and explore key research tasks within the OSI framework for a holistic MI network protocol in SAGUI. To bridge the gaps identified, we propose a MIC framework that supports TCP/IP and Linux, enabling full implementation of existing and emerging MIC solutions. This framework empowers researchers to leverage Linux resources and deep learning platforms for accelerated development of MIC in SAGUI networks. Remaining research challenges, open issues, and promising novel techniques are further identified to advance MIC research.</description>

      <title>Further Results on Safety-Critical Stabilization of Force-Controlled Nonholonomic Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the stabilization problem for force-controlled nonholonomic mobile robots under safety-critical constraints. We propose a continuous, time-invariant control law based on the gamma m-quadratic programming (gamma m-QP) framework, which unifies control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce both stability and safety in the closed-loop system. For the first time, we construct a global, time-invariant, strict Lyapunov function for the closed-loop nonholonomic mobile robot system with a nominal stabilization controller in polar coordinates; this strict Lyapunov function then serves as the CLF in the QP design. Next, by exploiting the inherent cascaded structure of the vehicle dynamics, we develop a CBF for the mobile robot via an integrator backstepping procedure. Our main results guarantee both asymptotic stability and safety for the closed-loop system. Both the simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Laser Fault Injection in Memristor-Based Accelerators for AI/ML and Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristive crossbar arrays (MCA) are emerging as efficient building blocks for in-memory computing and neuromorphic hardware due to their high density and parallel analog matrix-vector multiplication capabilities. However, the physical properties of their nonvolatile memory elements introduce new attack surfaces, particularly under fault injection scenarios. This work explores Laser Fault Injection as a means of inducing analog perturbations in MCA-based architectures. We present a detailed threat model in which adversaries target memristive cells to subtly alter their physical properties or outputs using laser beams. Through HSPICE simulations of a large MCA on 45 nm CMOS tech. node, we show how laser-induced photocurrent manifests in output current distributions, enabling differential fault analysis to infer internal weights with up to 99.7% accuracy, replicate the model, and compromise computational integrity through targeted weight alterations by approximately 143%.</description>

      <title>Learning Wireless Interference Patterns: Decoupled GNN for Throughput Prediction in Heterogeneous Multi-Hop p-CSMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable, per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible, and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of theoretical optima.</description>

      <title>Prescribed Performance Control of Deformable Object Manipulation in Spatial Latent Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating three-dimensional (3D) deformable objects presents significant challenges for robotic systems due to their infinite-dimensional state space and complex deformable dynamics. This paper proposes a novel model-free approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>RoboANKLE: Design, Development, and Functional Evaluation of a Robotic Ankle with a Motorized Compliant Unit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a powered transtibial prosthesis with complete push-off assistance, RoboANKLE. The design aims to fulfill specific requirements, such as a sufficient range of motion (RoM) while providing the necessary torque for achieving natural ankle motion in daily activities. Addressing the challenges faced in designing active transtibial prostheses, such as maintaining energetic autonomy and minimizing weight, is vital for the study. With this aim, we try to imitate the human ankle by providing extensive push-off assistance to achieve a natural-like torque profile. Thus, Energy Store and Extended Release mechanism (ESER) is employed with a novel Extra Energy Storage (EES) mechanism. Kinematic and kinetic analyses are carried out to determine the design parameters and assess the design performance. Subsequently, a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model is built and used in comprehensive dynamic and structural analyses. These analyses are used for the design performance evaluation and determine the forces and torques applied to the prosthesis, which aids in optimizing the design for minimal weight via structural analysis and topology optimization. The design of the prototype is then finalized and manufactured for experimental evaluation to validate the design and functionality. The prototype is realized with a mass of 1.92 kg and dimensions of 261x107x420 mm. The Functional evaluations of the RoboANKLE revealed that it is capable of achieving the natural maximum dorsi-flexion angle with 95% accuracy. Also, Thanks to the implemented mechanisms, the results show that RoboANKLE can generate 57% higher than the required torque for natural walking. The result of the power generation capacity of the RoboANKLE is 10% more than the natural power during the gait cycle.</description>

      <title>Stability Criteria and Motor Performance in Delayed Haptic Dyadic Interactions Mediated by Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters, where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for effective delay-compensation strategies.</description>

      <title>Architecture Is All You Need: Diversity-Enabled Sweet Spots for Robust Humanoid Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.</description>

      <title>CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.</description>

      <title>RDD: Retrieval-Based Demonstration Decomposer for Planner Alignment in Long-Horizon Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action (VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer (RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are available at rdd-neurips.github.io.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Fuel-Cell Airpath Control: an Efficiency-Aware MIMO Control Approach Combined with a Novel Constraint-Enforcing Reference Governor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical multivariable control and constraint management approach for an air supply system for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system. The control objectives are to track desired compressor mass airflow and cathode inlet pressure, maintain a minimum oxygen excess ratio (OER), and run the system at maximum net efficiency. A multi-input multi-output (MIMO) internal model controller (IMC) is designed and simulated to track flow and pressure set-points, which showed high performance despite strongly coupled plant dynamics. A new set-point map is generated to compute the most efficient cathode inlet pressure from the stack current load. To enforce OER constraints, a novel reference governor (RG) with the ability to govern multiple references (the cascade RG) and the ability to speed up as well as slow down a reference signal (the cross-section RG) is developed and tested. Compared with a single-input single-output (SISO) air-flow control approach, the proposed MIMO control approach shows up to 7.36 percent lower hydrogen fuel consumption. Compared to a traditional load governor, the novel cascaded cross-section RG (CC-RG) shows up to 3.68 percent less mean absolute percent error (MAPE) on net power tracking and greatly improved worst-case OER on realistic drive-cycle simulations. Control development and validations were conducted on two fuel cell system (FCS) models, a nonlinear open-source model and a proprietary Ford high-fidelity model</description>

      <title>Offline and Online Use of Interval and Set-Based Approaches for Control and State Estimation: A Selection of Methodological Approaches and Their Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11622v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control and state estimation procedures need to be robust against imprecisely known parameters, uncertainty in initial conditions, and external disturbances. Interval methods and other set-based techniques form the basis for the implementation of powerful approaches that can be used to identify parameters of dynamic system models in the presence of the aforementioned types of uncertainty. Moreover, they are applicable to a verified feasibility and stability analysis of controllers and state estimators. In addition to these approaches which are typically used offline for analysis of system models designed with classical floating point procedures, interval and set-based methods have also been developed in recent years, which allow to directly solve the associated design tasks and to implement reliable techniques that are applicable online, i.e., during system operation. The latter approaches include set-based model predictive control, online parameter adaptation techniques for nonlinear variable-structure and backstepping controllers, interval observers, and fault diagnosis techniques. This paper provides an overview of the methodological background and reviews numerous practical applications for which interval and other set-valued approaches have been employed successfully.</description>

      <title>Composite learning backstepping control with guaranteed exponential stability and robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive backstepping control provides a feasible solution to achieve asymptotic tracking for mismatched uncertain nonlinear systems. However, the closed-loop stability depends on high-gain feedback generated by nonlinear damping terms, and closed-loop exponential stability with parameter convergence involves a stringent condition named persistent excitation (PE). This paper proposes a composite learning backstepping control (CLBC) strategy based on modular backstepping and high-order tuners to compensate for the transient process of parameter estimation and achieve closed-loop exponential stability without the nonlinear damping terms and the PE condition. A novel composite learning mechanism is designed to maximize the staged exciting strength for parameter estimation, such that parameter convergence can be achieved under a condition of interval excitation (IE) or even partial IE that is strictly weaker than PE. An extra prediction error is employed in the adaptive law to ensure the transient performance without nonlinear damping terms. The exponential stability of the closed-loop system is proved rigorously under the partial IE or IE condition. Simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in both parameter estimation and control compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Strategy Templates for Almost-Sure and Positive Winning of Stochastic Parity Games towards Permissive and Resilient Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic games are fundamental in various applications, including the control of cyber-physical systems (CPS), where both controller and environment are modeled as players. Traditional algorithms typically aim to determine a single winning strategy to develop a controller. However, in CPS control and other domains, permissive controllers are essential, as they enable the system to adapt when additional constraints arise and remain resilient to runtime changes. This work generalizes the concept of (permissive winning) strategy templates, originally introduced by Anand et al. at TACAS and CAV 2023 for deterministic games, to incorporate stochastic games. These templates capture an infinite number of winning strategies, allowing for efficient strategy adaptation to system changes. We focus on two winning criteria (almost-sure and positive winning) and five winning objectives (safety, reachability, B\"uchi, co-B\"uchi, and parity). Our contributions include algorithms for constructing templates for each winning criterion and objective and a novel approach for extracting a winning strategy from a given template. Discussions on comparisons between templates and between strategy extraction methods are provided.</description>

Abstract: We develop a model predictive control (MPC) policy for station keeping on a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). The proposed policy achieves full-state tracking of a reference NRHO via a multiple-maneuver control horizon, each spaced one revolution apart to abide by typical mission operation requirements. We prove that the proposed policy is recursively feasible, and perform numerical evaluation in an output-feedback setting by incorporating a navigation filter and realistic operational uncertainties, where the proposed MPC is compared against the state-of-the-art station-keeping algorithm adopted for the Gateway. Our approach successfully maintains the spacecraft in the vicinity of the reference NRHO at a similar cumulative cost as existing station-keeping methods without encountering phase deviation issues, a common drawback of existing methods with one maneuver per revolution.</description>

      <title>A Weighted Predict-and-Optimize Framework for Power System Operation Considering Varying Impacts of Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prediction deviations of different uncertainties have varying impacts on downstream decision-making. Improving the prediction accuracy of critical uncertainties with significant impacts on decision-making quality yields better optimization results. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes a novel weighted predict-and-optimize (WPO) framework for decision-making under multiple uncertainties. Specifically, we incorporate an uncertainty-aware weighting mechanism into the predictive model to capture the relative impact of each uncertainty on specific optimization tasks, and introduce a problem-driven prediction loss (PDPL) to quantify the suboptimality of the weighted predictions relative to perfect predictions in downstream optimization. By optimizing the uncertainty weights to minimize the PDPL, the proposed WPO framework enables adaptive assessment of uncertainty impacts and joint learning of prediction and optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate weight optimization, we develop a surrogate model that establishes a direct mapping between the uncertainty weights and the PDPL, where enhanced graph convolutional networks and multi-task learning are adopted for efficient surrogate model construction and training. Numerical experiments on the modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed WPO framework outperforms the traditional predict-then-optimize paradigm, reducing the PDPL by an average of 55% within acceptable computational time.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently learning to play single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg games when the leader lacks knowledge of the lower-level game. Such games arise in hierarchical decision-making problems involving self-interested agents. For example, in electric ride-hailing markets, a central authority aims to learn optimal charging prices to shape fleet distributions and charging patterns of ride-hailing companies. Existing works typically apply gradient-based methods to find the leader's optimal strategy. Such methods are impractical as they require that the followers share private utility information with the leader. Instead, we treat the lower-level game as a black box, assuming only that the followers' interactions approximate a Nash equilibrium while the leader observes the realized cost of the resulting approximation. Under kernel-based regularity assumptions on the leader's cost function, we develop a no-regret algorithm that converges to an $\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium in $O(\sqrt{T})$ rounds. Finally, we validate our approach through a numerical case study on optimal pricing in electric ride-hailing markets.</description>

      <title>A predictive modular approach to constraint satisfaction under uncertainty - with application to glycosylation in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler, called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through a realistic simulation case study of glycosylation constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production using Chinese hamster ovary cells, for which the metabolic network model consists of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions.</description>

      <title>An AI-Driven Multimodal Smart Home Platform for Continuous Monitoring and Assistance in Post-Stroke Motor Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19000v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Moreover, the lack of integrated solutions capable of simultaneously monitoring motor recovery and providing intelligent assistance in home environments hampers rehabilitation outcomes. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94\% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns during daily activities. An optional head-mounted eye-tracking module, together with ambient sensors such as cameras and microphones, supports seamless hands-free control of household devices with a 100\% success rate and sub-second response time. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, ensuring low latency and data privacy. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions -- issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increased mean user satisfaction from 3.9 $\pm$ 0.8 in conventional home environments to 8.4 $\pm$ 0.6 with the full system ($n=20$). Beyond stroke, the system offers a scalable, patient-centered framework with potential for long-term use in broader neurorehabilitation and aging-in-place applications.</description>

      <title>Inferring Foresightedness in Dynamic Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent, e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions. These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, specifying how far into the future each agent plans. In practical settings, however, decision-makers may vary in foresightedness, or how much they care about their current cost in relation to their past and future costs. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's foresightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as an inverse dynamic game. We consider a specific objective function parametrization that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters to solve for agents' foresightedness. We conduct three experiments: one with synthetically generated delivery robot motion, one with real-world data involving people walking, biking, and driving vehicles, and one using high-fidelity simulators. The results of these experiments demonstrate that explicitly inferring agents' foresightedness enables game-theoretic models to make 33% more accurate models for agents' behavior.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System for Wireless Communications: Design, Modeling, Algorithm, Fabrication, and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm development, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability by adjusting the position and/or orientation of array elements, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. Based on this ER-FAS channel model, a low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. These results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency in both near-field and far-field scenarios compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally validated through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, several indoor communication experiments using a pair of software-defined radios demonstrate the superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</description>

      <title>Differentiable-by-design Nonlinear Optimization for Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optimization-based control policies, such as those those arising in nonlinear Model Predictive Control, have seen remarkable success in recent years. These policies require solving computationally demanding nonlinear optimization programs online at each time-step. The resulting solution map, viewed as a function of the measured state of the system and design parameters, may not be differentiable, which poses significant challenges if the control policy is embedded in a gradient-based policy optimization scheme. We propose a principled way to regularize the nonlinear optimization problem, obtaining a surrogate derivative even if when the original problem is not differentiable. The surrogate problem is differentiable by design and its solution map coincides with the solution of the unregularized problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a free-final-time optimal control problem and a receding-horizon nonlinear MPC example.</description>

      <title>Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets</title>

Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>

      <title>A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant (de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering, liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows 95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from 521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h) on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).</description>
