      <title>A roadmap to cosmological parameter analysis with third-order shear statistics IV. Analytic cross-covariance between second- and third-order aperture masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology, with second-order shear statistics commonly used to constrain parameters such as the matter density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and the clustering amplitude $S_8$. However, parameter degeneracies remain and can be reduced by including higher-order statistics such as the third-order aperture mass. To jointly analyse second- and third-order statistics, an accurate model of their cross-covariance is essential. We derive and validate a non-tomographic analytical model for the cross-covariance between second- and third-order aperture mass statistics. Analytical models are computationally efficient and enable cosmological parameter inference across a range of models, in contrast to numerical covariances derived from simulations or resampling, which are costly or biased. Our derivation is based on real-space estimators of the aperture mass. Substituting the Halofit power spectrum, BiHalofit bispectrum, and a halo-model tetraspectrum, we validate the model against numerical covariances from the $N$-body Scinet LIghtCone Simulations (SLICS) using shear catalogues and convergence maps. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis with both analytical and numerical covariances for several filter scale combinations. The cross-covariance separates into three terms governed by the power spectrum, bispectrum, and tetraspectrum, with the latter dominating. The analytical model qualitatively reproduces simulations, though differences arise from modelling approximations and numerical evaluation. Analytical contours are systematically tighter, with a combined figure of merit 72% of the numerical case, rising to 80% when small-scale information is excluded. This work completes the analytical covariance framework for second- and third-order aperture mass statistics, enabling joint parameter inference without large simulation suites.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Planck Relics are Ruled-Out as Dark Matter by LIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Gravity models suggest that singularities in gravitational collapse can be replaced by bounces, leading to the formation of Planck star remnants (PSR) that survive as stable relics once the black holes evaporate to the Planck mass. Recently, we proposed that such relics can be a viable candidate for dark matter. Here we show that LIGO's upper limit on the gravitational wave background rules out a formation pathway of Planck mass relics as dark matter from Gaussian initial conditions. This leaves non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations as the only viable channel for making Planck mass relics as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Merger-Induced Disturbance and Temporal Signatures in Galaxy Clusters: A Combined Phase Space and Photometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physically interpretable framework to quantify dynamical disturbances in galaxy clusters using projected two-dimensional phase-space information. Based on the TNG-Cluster simulation, we construct a disturbance score that captures merger-driven asymmetries through features such as velocity dispersion and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) peak fitting, which captures asymmetries indicative of dynamical disturbance. All features are derived from observable quantities and are intended to be measurable in future surveys.
  To enable observational application, we adopt a simplified estimator using aperture mass map statistics as a mass ratio proxy in TNG300-1, and validate its performance with weak lensing data from The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). While phase-space diagnostics reveal merger-driven asymmetries, they are not sensitive to whether the secondary progenitor is infalling or receding, and thus cannot distinguish future mergers from past mergers. To address this, we incorporate the star formation rate (SFR) from TNG-Cluster and propose the blue galaxy fraction as a promising observational tracer of merger timing.
  Finally, we construct mock Chandra X-ray images of TNG-Cluster halos at redshift $z=0.2$, and find that the offset between the X-ray peak and the position of the most massive black hole (used as a proxy for the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, BCG) correlates with our disturbance score, serving as a consistency check. We also perform case studies using LoVoCCS observational data, correlating the blue galaxy fraction with disturbance scores derived from the eROSITA morphology catalog.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Multipoles in Galaxy Surveys II: Comparing Different Methods in Assessing the Cosmic Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of estimators and Bayesian methods for determining the number count dipole from cosmological surveys. The increase in discordance between the number count dipole and the CMB's kinematic dipole has presented a challenge to the assumption of an isotropic and homogeneous universe. The level of discordance has depended on the choice of method to determine the dipole; hence, there is a need to compare them to determine the better approach. We select the healpy fit_dipole algorithm as our estimator and show that it gives unbiased results regardless of the noise levels and sky coverage in the data. However, for low sky coverage, the estimator's results have a large variance, which indicates that the estimator is not reliable in that regime. We then compare the estimator's outputs with the Bayesian results. If the sky coverage is sufficient, the Bayesian posterior probabilities agree with both the estimator's outcomes and the true parameter values. But if the sky coverage is low, Bayesian analysis is often inconclusive, which safeguards against incorrect conclusions. Both methods provide the ability to analyse multiple samples: on one hand, we need to select a different estimator, while in Bayesian inference, we need to extend our likelihood function to incorporate additional parameters. Our study emphasises the need to perform a principled statistical analysis of sky surveys for dipole determination.</description>

      <title>A New Precise Measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation Temperature at $z=0.89$ Toward PKS1830-211</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyzed millimeter-wave data toward the quasar PKS1830-211 observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to obtain absorption spectra of HCN $J$=2-1, $J$=3-2, $J$=4-3, and $J$=5-4 lines at the cosmological redshift of $z=0.89$. We confirmed multiple absorption components in each spectrum, and the two lower-$J$ lines are highly saturated at velocity centers of the two most prominent components. The effect of uncertainty in the continuum covering factor was carefully assessed using a Monte Carlo approach. We also accounted for systematic uncertainties in the HCN $J$=4-3 and $J$=5-4 absorption due to time variability during an intense flaring event of the quasar. Assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium and neglecting molecular collisions, we derived the excitation temperature profiles and their uncertainties in the optically thin regime. We determined the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature at $z = 0.89$ to be ${5.13\pm0.06\,\mathrm{K}}$ by taking a weighted average of calculated excitation temperatures; this is highly consistent with that expected from the standard model of the universe.</description>

      <title>Probing redshift-dependent systematics in the Hubble tension: Model-independent $H_0$ constraints from DESI R2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model-independent determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using the latest observational data from multiple cosmological probes. By combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the second data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR2), cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and the Pantheon Plus Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, we reconstruct the cosmic expansion history through Gaussian process regression without assuming a specific cosmological model or relying on sound horizon calibration. Our analysis incorporates the complete covariance structure of the measurements and yields $H_0$ constraints at five distinct redshifts: $65.72 \pm 1.99$ (z=0.51), $67.78 \pm 1.75$ (z=0.706), $70.74 \pm 1.39$ (z=0.934), $71.04 \pm 1.93$ (z=1.321), and $68.37 \pm 3.95~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ (z=1.484). The optimal combination of these measurements gives $\hat{H}_0 = 69.0 \pm 1.0~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ with 1.4\% precision, which occupies an intermediate position between the Planck CMB result and the SH0ES local measurement and is consistent with the TRGB result. Rather than providing a single integrated $H_0$ value, our approach delivers independent constraints at multiple redshifts, thereby enabling a detailed investigation of potential redshift-dependent systematic effects that could contribute to the Hubble tension. We identify significant correlations between adjacent redshift bins ($\rho = -0.033$ to $0.26$), primarily arising from the BAO covariance and reconstruction effects. These results demonstrate a clear redshift evolution in Hubble constant measurements and suggest that the Hubble tension may involve more complex redshift-dependent effects than a simple dichotomy between early and late universe probes.</description>

      <title>Resistive Scaling in the Magnetic Helicity-Driven Inverse Cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse cascade in MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in various astrophysical processes such as galaxy cluster formation, solar and stellar dynamo mechanisms, and the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early universe. A standard numerical approach involves injecting magnetic helicity at intermediate length scales to generate a secondary, time-dependent spectral peak that gradually propagates toward larger scales. Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\epsilon_\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\mathrm{H} \epsilon_\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant. We present a summary of the 25 distinct simulations conducted with the \textsc{Pencil Code}, systematically varying the forcing wavenumber $k_\mathrm{f}$, magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$, grid resolution $N^3$, and Lundquist number $Lu$. We obtained $C_\mathrm{H}$ and corresponding error bars by calculating the compensated spectrum and investigated its dependence with $Lu$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$. For the $C_\mathrm{H}$ - $Lu$ relationship, we observe strong correlations with power-law exponents of 1 and 2/3. In contrast, we find no significant correlation between $C_\mathrm{H}$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: Star formation over 12 Gyr from generative modelling of a deep infrared-selected galaxy catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study star formation over 12 Gyr using pop-cosmos, a generative model trained on 26-band photometry of 420,000 COSMOS2020 galaxies (IRAC Ch.1 $&lt;26$). The model learns distributions over 16 SPS parameters via score-based diffusion, matching observed colours and magnitudes. We compute the star formation rate density (SFRD) to $z=3.5$ by directly integrating individual galaxy SFRs. The SFRD peaks at $z=1.3\pm0.1$, with peak value $0.08\pm0.01$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. We classify star-forming (SF) and quiescent (Q) galaxies using specific SFR $&lt;10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparing with $NUVrJ$ colour selection. The sSFR criterion yields up to 20% smaller quiescent fractions across $0&lt;z&lt;3.5$, with $NUVrJ$-selected samples contaminated by galaxies with sSFR up to $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our sSFR-selected stellar mass function shows a negligible number density of low-mass ($&lt;10^{9.5}$ M$_\odot$) Q galaxies at $z\sim1$, where colour-selection shows a prominent increase. Non-parametric star formation histories around the SFRD peak reveal distinct patterns: SF galaxies show gradually decreasing SFR correlations with lookback time ($r\sim1$ to $r\sim0$ over 13 Gyr), implying increasingly stochastic star formation toward early epochs. Q galaxies exhibit full correlation ($r&gt;0.95$) during the most recent $\sim$300 Myr, then sharp decorrelation with earlier star-forming epochs, marking clear quenching transitions. Massive ($10&lt;\log_{10}(M_*/$M$_{\odot})&lt;11$) galaxies quench on a time-scale of $\sim1$ Gyr, with mass assembly concentrated in their first 3.5 Gyr. Finally, AGN activity (infrared luminosity) peaks as massive ($\sim10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$) galaxies approach the transition between star-forming and quiescent states, declining sharply once quiescence is established. This provides evidence that AGN feedback operates in a critical regime during the $\sim1$ Gyr quenching transition.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxy halo masses from spectroscopic and photometric lensing in DESI and DES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$ up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})&lt;$9.25) -- opening up a new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales $\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.</description>

      <title>A GLIMPSE of Intermediate Mass Black holes in the epoch of reionization: Witnessing the Descendants of Direct Collapse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5&lt;z&lt;7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.</description>

      <title>On the Fate of Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability and possible fates of Little Red Dots, under the stellar-only interpretation of their observational features. This is performed by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the densest stellar systems. We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range</description>

      <title>A DECADE of dwarfs: first detection of weak lensing around spectroscopically confirmed low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first detection of weak gravitational lensing around spectroscopically confirmed dwarf galaxies, using the large overlap between DESI DR1 spectroscopic data and DECADE/DES weak lensing catalogs. A clean dwarf galaxy sample with well-defined redshift and stellar mass cuts enables excess surface mass density measurements in two stellar mass bins ($\log \rm{M}_*=[8.2, 9.2]~M_\odot$ and $\log \rm{M}_*=[9.2, 10.2]~M_\odot$), with signal-to-noise ratios of $5.6$ and $12.4$ respectively. This signal-to-noise drops to $4.5$ and $9.2$ respectively for measurements without applying individual inverse probability (IIP) weights, which mitigates fiber incompleteness from DESI's targeting. The measurements are robust against variations in stellar mass estimates, photometric shredding, and lensing calibration systematics. Using a simulation-based modeling framework with stellar mass function priors, we constrain the stellar mass-halo mass relation and find a satellite fraction of $\simeq 0.3$, which is higher than previous photometric studies but $1.5\sigma$ lower than $\Lambda$CDM predictions. We find that IIP weights have a significant impact on lensing measurements and can change the inferred $f_{\rm{sat}}$ by a factor of two, highlighting the need for accurate fiber incompleteness corrections for dwarf galaxy samples. Our results open a new observational window into the galaxy-halo connection at low masses, showing that future massively multiplexed spectroscopic observations and weak lensing data will enable stringent tests of galaxy formation models and $\Lambda$CDM predictions.</description>

      <title>Collider probes of baryogenesis with maximal CP asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel collider probe of baryogenesis at TeV scale by measuring decay asymmetries into particle and anti-particle final states. Motivated by the idea of Dirac leptogenesis, we consider an extension of the standard model with new colored and $SU(2)_L$ singlet particles in such a way that the out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy colored fermions creates equal and opposite CP asymmetries in two sectors, prevented from equilibrating with each other. While the TeV scale viability of this mechanism requires a resonantly enhanced CP asymmetry, the latter also plays a crucial role leading to observable decay asymmetries in colliders. In addition to discussing conventional signatures of such heavy colored particles, namely, mono-jet plus missing transverse energy, displaced vertex, colored track at hadron colliders, we also show the unique possibility of measuring decay asymmetries via forward-backward and charge asymmetries at future muon colliders. In addition to being a verifiable TeV-scale baryogenesis scenario, the model also predicts a singlet scalar dark matter candidate consistent with the required thermal dark matter properties near the Higgs resonance.</description>

      <title>Galactic Contrail in NGC 3627 caused by Dwarf Galaxy Candidate or Massive Black Hole Flyby</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a kpc scale molecular contrail in the spiral galaxy NGC 3627, a narrow structure spanning 8 kpc in length with a width of 200 pc and an extreme aspect ratio of 40, observed in both mid-infrared dust emission (PHANGS-JWST) and CO(2-1) gas (PHANGS-ALMA). This contrail size significantly exceeds the size of any known analogs in the Milky Way and exhibits supersonic turbulence (10 km/s). Its morphology and dynamics are consistent with gravitational focusing by a flyby compact object of mass 1e6 M_sun, likely a massive black hole or a dwarf galaxy nucleus, traversing the disk at &gt;300 km/s. The crossing time of such a contrail, estimated from its width and velocity dispersion, is only $\sim 20$ Myr, implying a recent interaction. This contrail can be caused by a dwarf galaxy, or massive black hole nucleus. This discovery establishes galactic-scale contrails as probes of massive dark objects interacting with medium in and around galactic disks.</description>

      <title>A sample of 3403 galaxy clusters identified in XMM-Newton X-ray images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, the number of galaxy clusters identified using galaxy data has far exceeded the number derived from intracluster medium data. In this study, we used positional information from large optical cluster catalogues to search for previously unrecognized X-ray galaxy clusters in archival XMM-Newton data. We successfully identified 1490 galaxy clusters in X-ray images for the first time. By incorporating 1913 previously known X-ray clusters, we constructed a sample of 3403 galaxy clusters observed by XMM-Newton. Our cluster mass estimates show broad consistency with previous measurements. Comparative analyses between the known and newly identified subsamples revealed that new X-ray clusters exhibit systematically higher redshifts, lower masses, and smaller X-ray-to-optical mass ratios, but show no systematic differences in dynamical properties. The newly identified X-ray clusters are a valuable addition to previous X-ray samples and are important for future statistical studies.</description>

      <title>Scalaron dark matter dynamics: effects of Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key features of the $R^2$-gravity is the embedding of a scalar field, scalaron, into the gravity sector. The scalaron interacts with the Standard Model (SM) matter fields through Planck-suppressed couplings. If the scalaron serves as a viable dark matter (DM) candidate, it can account for the lack of evidence of DM interactions beyond gravity in experimental and observational probes to date. The realization of the scalaron, as a cold DM candidate, depends on an induced trilinear interaction with the SM Higgs, despite its suppressed coupling strength. Here, we introduce a Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity that additionally contributes to the induced trilinear interaction with its existing competing part, originated from the $R^2$-gravity. We study the interplay between these two contributions in the early universe, which determines both the initial conditions and evolution of the scalaron, leading to cold DM behavior at a later epoch. The trilinear interaction vanish identically for certain combinations of the Higgs non-minimal coupling and the scalaron mass, thereby setting the scalaron density through misalignment mechanism, similar to axions. Consequently, we find that the observed DM relic density is obtained for a scalaron mass between $1.38$ keV and $0.7$ MeV. The lower limit on the mass stems from the LHC constraints on the Higgs non-minimal coupling, whereas the upper bound arises from INTEGRAL/SPI limits on the excess gamma-ray flux from possible scalaron decays to two photons.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from two scalar fields unifying the dark sector with inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Dark Matter with Cosmic Gravitational Focusing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of using the cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) to probe the minor light dark matter (DM) component whose mass is in the range of $(0.1 \sim 100)$\,eV. Being a purely gravitational effect, the CGF offers a mode-independent probe that is complementary to the existing ways such as Lyman-$\alpha$ and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Such effect finally leads to a dipole density distribution that would affect the galaxy formation and hence can be reconstructed with galaxy surveys such as DESI. Both the free-streaming and clustering limits have been studied with analytical formulas while the region in between is bridged with interpolation. We show the projected sensitivity at DESI with the typical phase space distribution of a freeze-in DM scenario as illustration.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes formation in inflationary $F(R)$ models with scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Probing the mass relation between supermassive black holes and dark matter halos at high redshifts by gravitational wave experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous observations have shown that almost all galaxies in our Universe host supermassive black holes (SMBHs), but there is still much debate about their formation and evolutionary processes. Recently, gravitational waves (GWs) have been expected to be a new and important informative observation, in particular, in the low-frequency region by making use of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). As an evolutionary process of the SMBHs, we revisit a dark matter (DM) halo-SMBH coevolution model based on the halo merger tree employing an ansatz for the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at $z=6$. In this model, the mass of SMBHs grows through their mergers associated with the halo mergers, and hence the evolutionary information must be stored in the GWs emitted at the mergers. We investigate the stochastic gravitational background from the coalescing SMBH binaries, which the PTAs can detect, and also the GW bursts emitted at the mergers, which can be detected by the mHz band observations such as LISA. We also discuss the possibility of probing the mass relation between the DM halos and the SMBHs at high redshift by future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Matter Dipole and Hubble Tension due to Large Wavelength Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the dipole anisotropy observed in the quasar distribution from the CatWISE2020 catalog. The catalog data shows a peak around $z\approx 1$, suggesting the presence of a large-scale dipole component. We explore the possibility that this dipole could be driven by primordial density fluctuations from modes that were superhorizon at the time of CMB decoupling but have since entered the horizon and become subhorizon. In particular, we consider the impact of adiabatic modes with wave numbers $k$ in the range $(10^{-4} - 4 \times 10^{-3})~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} $, corresponding to wavelength scales of several Gpc. Such modes can create large-scale density variations, likely causing anisotropies in the distribution of matter and, as a result, affecting the number density of observed quasars. We find that these can lead to a significant contribution to the dipole for sources up to redshifts of about 1, but are unable to explain the observed dipole. We also demonstrate that a superhorizon curvature perturbations mode, with a comoving wavenumber $k\lesssim0.3H_0$ can lead to a significant enhancement in the locally inferred Hubble constant. This effect offers a viable explanation for the observed discrepancy between local and CMB inferred measurements of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>AMICO galaxy clusters in KiDS-1000: cosmological constraints and mass calibration from counts and weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the joint modelling of weak-lensing and count measurements of the galaxy clusters detected with the AMICO code, in the fourth data release of the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). The analysed sample comprises about 8000 clusters, covering an effective area of 839 deg$^{2}$ and extending up to a redshift of $z = 0.8$. Stacked cluster weak-lensing and count measurements have been derived in bins of redshift and intrinsic richness, $\lambda^*$. Based on self-organising maps, we reconstructed the true redshift distributions of the background galaxy samples. We accounted for the systematic uncertainties arising from impurities in the background and cluster samples, biases in the cluster $z$ and $\lambda^*$, projection effects, halo orientation and miscentring, truncation of cluster halo mass distributions, matter correlated with cluster haloes, multiplicative shear bias, baryonic matter, geometric distortions in the lensing profiles, uncertainties in the theoretical halo mass function, and super-sample covariance. We also employed a blinding strategy based on perturbing the cluster sample completeness. The improved statistics and photometry compared to the previous KiDS data release, KiDS-DR3, have led to a halving of the uncertainties on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$, as we obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.22\pm0.02$ and $\sigma_8=0.86\pm0.03$. The constraint on $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$, $S_8=0.74\pm0.03$, is in excellent agreement with recent cluster count and KiDS-1000 cosmic shear analyses, while it shows a $2.8\sigma$ tension with Planck cosmic microwave background results. The constraints on the $\log\lambda^*-\log M_{200}$ relation imply a mass precision of 8%, on average. In addition, the result on the intrinsic scatter of the $\log\lambda^*-\log M_{200}$ relation, $\sigma_{\rm intr}=0.05\pm0.02$, confirms that $\lambda^*$ is an excellent mass proxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divide'' $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmologies, while offering a compelling alternative to inflationary models, face challenges from the growth of vector perturbations during the contracting phase. While linear vector instabilities can be avoided with specific initial conditions or the absence of vector degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the significant role of secondary vector perturbations generated by nonlinear interactions with scalar fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that in a broad class of single-field matter-bounce scenarios, these secondary vector perturbations get unacceptably large amplitudes, provided the curvature fluctuations are consistent with cosmic microwave background observations. This finding underscores the crucial importance of scalar-induced vector perturbations in bouncing cosmology and highlights the need for further investigation into their potential impact on the viability of these models.</description>

Abstract: We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.</description>

      <title>First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XIX: Supermassive black hole mergers in the early Universe and their environmental dependence</title>

Abstract: The upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory, LISA, is expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers occurring at high redshifts. However, understanding the origin and growth of SMBHs in the early Universe remains an open problem in astrophysics. In this work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass ($m_{\rm seed} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{5}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$) while primary SMBHs span up to $10^{9}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$, resulting in mass ratios from $q \sim 10^{-4}$ to $1$, with a peak at $q \sim 1$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the comoving total number density scales with overdensity as $n_{\rm merger} = 10^{-3.81} (1 + \delta)^{4.78}$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with $10^{5} \lesssim M_{\rm tot}/{\rm M}_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{8}$ and $q \gtrsim 10^{-2}$, corresponding to a detection rate of $0.030~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio ${\rm SNR} \geq 10$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's scientific return.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetogenesis from a supercooled dynamical electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of $\gamma$-ray from blazars suggest the presence of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium, which may require a primordial origin. Intense enough primordial magnetic fields can arise from theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking during the big bang, where supercooling is ended by a strongly first order phase transition. We consider theories involving new scalars and possibly vectors, including thermal particle dark matter candidates. Intense enough magnetic fields can arise if the reheating temperature after the phase transition is below a few TeV. The same dynamics also leaves testable primordial gravitational waves and possibly primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive dynamical and phenomenological analysis of structure growth in curvature-modulated coupled quintessence scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa \rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R^2/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa \phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable, non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by $\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast $\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus $\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable approach to interacting dark energy.</description>

      <title>Expected Constraints on the Intergalactic Magnetic Field using Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The InterGalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF), which could permeate the cosmic voids but was never detected so far, is considered a relic of the early Universe. Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the electromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit achieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\;\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for realistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal fit to characterise the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases to assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF strengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\;\mathrm{G}$. Notably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1, already allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\times 10^{-17}\;\mathrm{G}$.</description>
