      <title>Programs as Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a correspondence between the structure of Turing machines and the structure of singularities of real analytic functions, based on connecting the Ehrhard-Regnier derivative from linear logic with the role of geometry in Watanabe's singular learning theory. The correspondence works by embedding ordinary (discrete) Turing machine codes into a family of noisy codes which form a smooth parameter space. On this parameter space we consider a potential function which has Turing machines as critical points. By relating the Taylor series expansion of this potential at such a critical point to combinatorics of error syndromes, we relate the local geometry to internal structure of the Turing machine.
  The potential in question is the negative log-likelihood for a statistical model, so that the structure of the Turing machine and its associated singularity is further related to Bayesian inference. Two algorithms that produce the same predictive function can nonetheless correspond to singularities with different geometries, which implies that the Bayesian posterior can discriminate between distinct algorithmic implementations, contrary to a purely functional view of inference. In the context of singular learning theory our results point to a more nuanced understanding of Occam's razor and the meaning of simplicity in inductive inference.</description>

      <title>A Proof-Theoretic Approach to the Semantics of Classical Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear logic (LL) is a resource-aware, abstract logic programming language that refines both classical and intuitionistic logic. Linear logic semantics is typically presented in one of two ways: by associating each formula with the set of all contexts that can be used to prove it (e.g. phase semantics) or by assigning meaning directly to proofs (e.g. coherence spaces).
  This work proposes a different perspective on assigning meaning to proofs by adopting a proof-theoretic perspective. More specifically, we employ base-extension semantics (BeS) to characterise proofs through the notion of base support.
  Recent developments have shown that BeS is powerful enough to capture proof-theoretic notions in structurally rich logics such as intuitionistic linear logic. In this paper, we extend this framework to the classical case, presenting a proof-theoretic approach to the semantics of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL).</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Generalized HyperLTL with Stuttering and Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We settle the complexity of satisfiability and model-checking for generalized HyperLTL with stuttering and contexts, an expressive logic for the specification of asynchronous hyperproperties. Such properties cannot be specified in HyperLTL, as it is restricted to synchronous hyperproperties.
  Nevertheless, we prove that satisfiability is $\Sigma_1^1$-complete and thus not harder than for HyperLTL. On the other hand, we prove that model-checking is equivalent to truth in second-order arithmetic, and thus much harder than the decidable HyperLTL model-checking problem. The lower bounds for the model-checking problem hold even when only allowing stuttering or only allowing contexts.</description>

      <title>A Complete Formal Specification and Verification of the BESW software control system of the Maeslant Storm Surge Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maeslant Barrier is a storm surge barrier that protects Rotterdam and its harbour from storm surges in the North Sea. Its software control consists of three major components, one of which is BesW. BesW is responsible for all the movements of the barrier except for pushing and pulling it. In this document, we report on the complete formal specification of BesW in mCRL2. All its behaviour has been specified, including manual and testing modes. Furthermore, all fault situations have been taken into account. The formalisation allows formal verification of all behavioural properties, formulated in the modal $\mu$-calculus, with the constraints that water levels only have a restricted number of values and not all combinations of failures of pumps and valves are allowed.</description>

      <title>Prophecies all the Way: Game-based Model-Checking for HyperQPTL beyond $\forall^*\exists^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-checking HyperLTL, a temporal logic expressing properties of sets of traces with applications to information-flow based security and privacy, has a decidable, but TOWER-complete, model-checking problem. In the classical algorithm, the complexity manifests itself with a need for the complementation of automata over infinite words. To overcome this aforementioned need, a game-based alternative for the $\forall^*\exists^*$-fragment was recently presented.
  Here, we employ imperfect information-games to extend the game-based approach to full HyperQPTL, i.e., we allow arbitrary quantifier prefixes and quantification over propositions, which allows us to express every $\omega$-regular hyperproperty. As a byproduct of our game-based algorithm, we obtain finite-state implementations of Skolem functions via transducers with lookahead that explain satisfaction or violation of HyperQPTL properties.</description>

      <title>Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement for Generalized Graph Transformation Systems (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the following verification task: Given a graph transformation system and a class of initial graphs, can we guarantee (non-)reachability of a given other class of graphs that characterizes bad or erroneous states? Both initial and bad states are characterized by nested conditions (having first-order expressive power). Such systems typically have an infinite state space, causing the problem to be undecidable. We use abstract interpretation to obtain a finite approximation of that state space, and employ counter-example guided abstraction refinement to iteratively obtain suitable predicates for automated verification. Although our primary application is the analysis of graph transformation systems, we state our result in the general setting of reactive systems.</description>

      <title>Constructing Witnesses for Lower Bounds on Behavioural Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apartness of states in transition systems has seen growing interest recently as an inductive counterpart to many well-established bisimilarity notions. The constructive nature of apartness allows the definition of derivation systems for reasoning about apartness of states. It further corresponds closely to distinguishing formulas in suitable modal logics. Both the derivations and distinguishing formulas provide (finite) evidence for differences in the behaviour of states. The current paper provides a derivation system in the setting of behavioural distances on labelled Markov chains. Rather than showing pairs of states apart, the system allows the derivation of lower bounds on their distance, complementing existing work giving upper bounds. We further show the soundness and (approximate) completeness of the system with respect to the behavioural distance. We go on to give a constructive correspondence between our derivation system and formulas in a modal logic with quantitative semantics. This logic was used in recent work of Rady and van Breugel to construct evidence for lower bounds on behavioural distances. Our constructions will provide smaller witnessing formulas in many examples.</description>

      <title>The Steenrod squares via unordered joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Steenrod squares are cohomology operations with important applications in algebraic topology. While these operations are well-understood classically, little is known about them in the setting of homotopy type theory. Although a definition of the Steenrod squares was put forward by Brunerie (2017), proofs of their characterising properties have remained elusive. In this paper, we revisit Brunerie's definition and provide proofs of these properties, including stability, Cartan's formula and the Adem relations. This is done by studying a higher inductive type called the unordered join. This approach is inherently synthetic and, consequently, many of our proofs differ significantly from their classical counterparts. Along the way, we discuss upshots and limitations of homotopy type theory as a synthetic language for homotopy theory. The paper is accompanied by a computer formalisation in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>Online Monitoring of Metric Temporal Logic using Sequential Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:1901.00175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a popular formalism to specify temporal patterns with timing constraints over the behavior of cyber-physical systems with application areas ranging in property-based testing, robotics, optimization, and learning. This paper focuses on the unified construction of sequential networks from MTL specifications over discrete and dense time behaviors to provide an efficient and scalable online monitoring framework. Our core technique, future temporal marking, utilizes interval-based symbolic representations of future discrete and dense timelines. Building upon this, we develop efficient update and output functions for sequential network nodes for timed temporal operations. Finally, we extensively test and compare our proposed technique with existing approaches and runtime verification tools. Results highlight the performance and scalability advantages of our monitoring approach and sequential networks.</description>

      <title>The Big-O Problem for Max-Plus Automata is Decidable (PSPACE-Complete)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the big-O problem for max-plus automata is decidable and PSPACE-complete. The big-O (or affine domination) problem asks whether, given two max-plus automata computing functions f and g, there exists a constant c such that f &lt; cg+ c. This is a relaxation of the containment problem asking whether f &lt; g, which is undecidable. Our decidability result uses Simon's forest factorisation theorem, and relies on detecting specific elements, that we call witnesses, in a finite semigroup closed under two special operations: stabilisation and flattening.</description>

      <title>Dualformer: Controllable Fast and Slow Thinking by Learning with Randomized Reasoning Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In human cognition theory, human thinking is governed by two systems: the fast and intuitive System 1 and the slower but more deliberative System 2. Recent studies have shown that incorporating System 2 process into Transformers including large language models (LLMs), significantly enhances their reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, models that purely resemble System 2 thinking require substantially higher computational costs and are much slower to respond. To address this challenge, we present Dualformer, a single Transformer model that seamlessly integrates both the fast and slow reasoning modes. Dualformer is obtained by training on data with randomized reasoning traces, where different parts of the traces are dropped during training. The dropping strategies are specifically tailored according to the trace structure, analogous to analyzing our thinking process and creating shortcuts with patterns. At inference time, our model can be configured to output only the solutions (fast mode) or both the reasoning chain and the final solution (slow mode), or automatically decide which mode to engage (auto mode). In all cases, Dualformer outperforms the corresponding baseline models in both performance and computational efficiency: (1) in slow mode, Dualformer optimally solves unseen 30 x 30 maze navigation tasks 97.6% of the time, surpassing the Searchformer (trained on data with complete reasoning traces) baseline performance of 93.3%, while only using 45.5% fewer reasoning steps; (2) in fast mode, Dualformer completes those tasks with an 80% optimal rate, significantly outperforming the Solution-Only model (trained on solution-only data), which has an optimal rate of only 30%. For math problems, our techniques have also achieved improved performance with LLM fine-tuning, showing its generalization beyond task-specific models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hofstadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Learning Verified Monitors for Hidden Markov Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Runtime monitors assess whether a system is in an unsafe state based on a stream of observations. We study the problem where the system is subject to probabilistic uncertainty and described by a hidden Markov model. A stream of observations is then unsafe if the probability of being in an unsafe state is above a threshold. A correct monitor recognizes the set of unsafe observations. The key contribution of this paper is the first correct-by-construction synthesis method for such monitors, represented as finite automata. The contribution combines four ingredients: First, we establish the coNP-hardness of checking whether an automaton is a correct monitor, i.e., a monitor without misclassifications. Second, we provide a reduction that reformulates the search for misclassifications into a standard probabilistic system synthesis problem. Third, we integrate the verification routine into an active automata learning routine to synthesize correct monitors. Fourth, we provide a prototypical implementation that shows the feasibility and limitations of the approach on a series of benchmarks.</description>
