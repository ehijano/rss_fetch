      <title>Crystal formation in systems of pseudo-forced swarmalators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarmalators are active agents that move in position space and exhibit internal degrees of freedom. Due to interactions of their positions and phases of oscillation, they show on the one hand swarming, similar to the effect of flocking of birds. In addition, they exhibit synchronization behavior, analogous to what has been observed in fireflies. Previous works studied scenarios in which the phases are forced externally. Here, we consider a pseudo-force that acts on the positions of the swarmalators. Due to the resulting attraction towards the center of position space, transitions from the splintered and active phase-wave state to the static antisynchronized state are found. To quantify the crystal order of swarmalators, we introduce an order parameter that is based on the Fourier transform of their positions.</description>

      <title>Neural Policy Composition from Free Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to compose acquired skills to plan and execute behaviors is a hallmark of natural intelligence. Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability.</description>

      <title>Self-Propelled Agents and Group Social Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a given social topology. To simplify our discussion the binary choice problem is particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society, especially in the field of economics and social science.</description>
