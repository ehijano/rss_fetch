      <title>Granular gases under resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the granular temperatures in force-free granular gases under exponential resetting. When a resetting event occurs, the granular temperature attains its initial value, while between the resetting events it cools down. We show that the granular system attains a non-equilibrium steady state value and study the dependence of average granular temperature on the resetting rate. Our theory may help to explain the behavior of non-periodically driven granular systems.</description>

      <title>Glassy Dynamics in a Molecular Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal dynamical crossover temperature, Tcr, in glassy liquids, associated with the {\alpha}-\b{eta} bifurcation temperature, TB, has been observed in dielectric spectroscopy and other experiments. Tcr lies significantly above the glass transition temperature. Here, we introduce a new class of glass-forming liquids, binary mixtures of prolate and oblate ellipsoids. This model system exhibits sharp thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies, such as the specific heat jump during heating and a sharp variation in the thermal expansion coefficient around a temperature identified as the glass transition temperature, Tg. The same temperature is obtained from the fit of the calculated relaxation times to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) form. As the temperature is lowered, the single peak rotational relaxation spectrum splits into two at a temperature TB significantly above the estimated Tg. Similar bifurcation is also observed in the distribution of short-to-intermediate time translational diffusion. Interrogation of the two peaks reveals a lower extent of dynamic heterogeneity in the population of the faster mode. We observe an unexpected appearance of a sharp peak in the product of rotational relaxation time {\tau}2 and diffusion constant D at a temperature Tcr, close to TB, but above the glass transition temperature. Additionally, we coarse-grain the system into cubic boxes, each containing, on average, ~62 particles, to study the average dynamical properties. Clear evidence of large-scale sudden changes in the diffusion coefficient and rotational correlation time signals first-order transitions between low and high-mobility domains.</description>

      <title>Capillary-lubrication force between rotating cylinders separated by a fluid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two cylinders rotating next to each other generate a large hydrodynamic force if the intermediate space is filled with a viscous fluid. Herein, we explore the case where the cylinders are separated by two layers of viscous immiscible fluids, in the limit of small capillary deformation of the fluid interface. As the interface deformation breaks the system's symmetry, a novel force characteristic of soft lubrication is generated. We calculate this capillary-lubrication force, which is split into velocity-dependant and acceleration-dependant contributions. Furthermore, we analyze the variations induced by modifying the viscosity ratio between the two fluid layers, their thickness ratio, and the Bond number. Unlike standard elastic cases, where a repelling soft-lubrication lift force has been abundantly reported, the current fluid bilayer setting can also exhibit an attractive force due to the non-monotonic deflection of the fluid interface when varying the sublayer thickness. Besides, at high Bond numbers, the system's response becomes analogous to the one of a Winkler-like substrate with a viscous flow inside.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active repulsive mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneity is a ubiquitous feature in many biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. In addition to conservative interactions between active constituents, a non-equilibrium environment often induces effective non-reciprocal (NR) couplings. The full consequences, especially for systems with order parameters of different symmetries, still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active NR mixture exhibiting both, polar ordering and clustering using a combination of hydrodynamic theory, linear stability analysis, particle-based simulations and fluctuation analysis. We show that NR alignment interactions have profound influence on the density dynamics already far below the threshold related to spontaneous time dependency of polarization dynamics. In particular, NR alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering, and thus, partial demixing with single-species clusters chasing more dilute accumulations of the other species. Extremely large NR alignment eventually leads to a disappearance of clustered states.</description>

      <title>Memory signatures in path curvature of self-avoidant model particles are revealed by time delayed self mutual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent behavior in active systems is a complex byproduct of local, often pairwise, interactions. One such interaction is self-avoidance, which experimentally can arise as a response to self-generated environmental signals; such experiments have inspired non-Markovian mathematical models. In previous work, we set out to find ``hallmarks of self-avoidant memory" in a particle model for environmentally responsive swimming droplets. In our analysis, we found that transient self-trapping was a spatial hallmark of the particle's self-avoidant memory response. The self-trapping results from the combined effects of behaviors at multiple scales: random reorientations, which occur on the diffusion scale, and the self-avoidant memory response, which occurs on the ballistic (and longer) timescales. In this work, we use the path curvature as it encodes the self-trapping response to estimate an ``effective memory lifetime" by analyzing the decay of its time-delayed mutual information and subsequently determining the longevity of significant nonlinear correlations. This effective memory lifetime (EML) is longer in systems where the curvature is a product of both self-avoidance and random reorientations as compared to systems without self-avoidance.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-guided inverse design of self-assembling multiscale DNA origami tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances enable the creation of nanoscale building blocks with complex geometries and interaction specificities for self-assembly. This nearly boundless design space necessitates design principles for defining the mutual interactions between multiple particle species to target a user-specified complex structure or pattern. In this article, we develop a symmetry-based method to generate the interaction matrices that specify the assembly of two-dimensional tilings which we illustrate using equilateral triangles. By exploiting the allowed 2D symmetries, we develop an algorithmic approach by which any periodic 2D tiling can be generated from an arbitrarily large number of subunit species, notably addressing an unmet challenge of engineering 2D crystals with periodicities that can be arbitrarily larger than subunit size. To demonstrate the utility of our design approach, we encode specific interactions between triangular subunits synthesized by DNA origami and show that we can guide their self-assembly into tilings with a wide variety of symmetries, using up to 12 unique species of triangles. By conjugating specific triangles with gold nanoparticles, we fabricate gold-nanoparticle supercrystals whose lattice parameter spans up to 300 nm. Finally, to generate economical design rules, we compare the design economy of various tilings. In particular, we show that (1) higher symmetries allow assembly of larger unit cells with fewer subunits and (2) linear supercrystals can be designed more economically using linear primitive unit cells. This work provides a simple algorithmic approach to designing periodic assemblies, which may open new doors to the multiscale assembly of superlattices of nanostructured "metatoms" with engineered plasmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Resin Molecular Weight on Drying Kinetics and Sag of Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work herein investigates the impact of resin molecular weight and solvent choice on drying kinetics and sag velocity in polymer films. These films, ranging in thickness from ~60 micrometer to ~120 micrometer were formulated with 45% by weight polymer resin in one of two solvent packages with different relative evaporation rates (RER). Gravimetry was initially used to track drying kinetics and a one-dimensional diffusion model was utilized to compute the apparent solvent diffusivity. In addition, the film thickness was tracked with optical profilometry. Results from these measurements showed that for fixed molecular weight the drying kinetics increased by approximately two-fold for the high RER solvent, whereas the apparent diffusivity tended to increase with increasing polymer molecular weight. Films formulated from higher molecular weight resins had greater initial viscosities and thicknesses for identical draw down blade clearance. By extension, the higher apparent diffusivities at greater molecular weights were attributed to effects of prolonged evaporation times for the thicker films. The sag velocity was measured through the thickness of the film for these systems at a 5 degree incline using the Variable Angle Inspection Microscope (VAIM). Measurements showed an increase in sag velocity for thinner and less viscous films, which was somewhat surprising both because a thinner film will experience lower gravitational stress and quicker drying times as compared to a thicker film. From these data we conclude that formulating a coating with higher molecular weight resin, although likely to increase drying time, will tend to deter sag because of the large impact of viscosity on these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling function ansatz for finite-temperature jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We cast a nonzero-temperature analysis of the jamming transition into the framework of a scaling ansatz. We show that four distinct regimes for scaling exponents of thermodynamic derivatives of the free energy such as pressure, bulk and shear moduli, can be consolidated by introducing a universal scaling function with two branches. Both the original analysis and the scaling theory assume that the system always resides in a single basis in the energy landscape. The two branches are separated by a line $T^*(\Delta \phi)$ in the $T-\Delta \phi$ plane, where $\Delta \phi=\phi-\phi_c^\Lambda$ is the deviation of the packing fraction from its critical, jamming value, $\phi_c^\Lambda$, for that basin. The branch for $T&lt;T^*(\Delta \phi)$ reduces at $T=0$ to an earlier scaling ansatz that is restricted to $T=0$, $\Delta \phi \ge 0$, while the branch for $T&gt;T^*(\Delta \phi)$ reproduces exponents observed for thermal hard spheres. In contrast to the usual scenario for critical phenomena, the two branches are characterized by different exponents. We suggest that this unusual feature can be resolved by the existence of a dangerous irrelevant variable $u$, which can appear to modify exponents if the leading $u=0$ term is sufficiently small in the regime described by one of the two branches of the scaling function.</description>

      <title>Basal force fluctuations and granular rheology: Linking macroscopic descriptions of granular flows to bed forces with implications for monitoring signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Granular flows are ubiquitous in nature with single flows traversing a wide range of dynamic conditions from initiation to deposition. Many of these flows are responsible for significant hazards and have the ability to generate remotely detectable seismic signals. These signals provide a potential for real-time flow measurements from a safe distance. To fully realize the benefit of seismic measurements, basal granular forces must be linked to macroscopic internal flow dynamics across a wide range of flow conditions. We utilize discrete element simulations to observe dry and submerged granular flows under plane-shear and inclined flow configurations, relating bulk kinematics to basal force distributions. We find that force fluctuations scale with non-dimensional shear-rate ($I$), and this scaling tracks three flow regimes that can be described by $\mu(I)$ rheology, as well as a fourth regime that marks a `phase change' from a liquid-like to a gas-like state: (1) an unsteady particle rearrangement regime when $I&lt;10^{-3}$, where basal forces are dominated by low frequencies; (2) an intermediate regime when $10^{-3}&lt; I&lt;10^{-2}$, where basal forces start to become noise-like, (3) a transitional regime at $10^{-2}&lt;I&lt;10^{-1}$, where the increase in basal tractions with increasing shear-rates stalls as the granular bed dilates, partially destroying the contact network and memory stored in the particle contact network, and (4) a fully collisional regime when $I&gt;10^{-1}$, where the signal is nearly flat up to a cutoff frequency. This effort suggests that basal forces can be used to interpret complex granular processes in geophysical flows.</description>

      <title>Flipping Out: Role of Arginine in Hydrophobic Polymer Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arginine has been a mainstay in biological formulation development for decades. To date, the way arginine modulates protein stability has been widely studied and debated. Here, we employed a hydrophobic polymer to decouple hydrophobic effects from other interactions relevant to protein folding. While existing hypotheses for the effects of arginine can generally be categorized as either direct or indirect, our results indicate that direct and indirect mechanisms of arginine co-exist and oppose each other. At low concentrations, arginine was observed to stabilize hydrophobic polymer collapse via a sidechain-dominated direct mechanism, while at high concentrations, arginine stabilized polymer collapse via a backbone-dominated indirect mechanism. These findings highlight the modular nature of the widely used additive arginine, with relevance in the design of stable biological formulations.</description>

      <title>Superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory for colloidal suspensions under homogeneous steady-shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superadiabatic dynamical density functional theory (superadiabatic-DDFT) is a promising new method for the study of colloidal systems out-of-equilibrium. Within this approach the viscous forces arising from interparticle interactions are accounted for in a natural way by treating explicitly the dynamics of the two-body correlations. For bulk systems subject to spatially homogeneous shear we use the superadiabatic-DDFT framework to calculate the steady-state pair distribution function and the corresponding viscosity for low values of the shear-rate. We then consider a variant of the central approximation underlying this superadiabatic theory and obtain an inhomogeneous generalization of a rheological bulk theory due to Russel and Gast. This paper thus establishes for the first time a connection between DDFT approaches, formulated to treat inhomogeneous systems, and existing work addressing nonequilibrium microstructure and rheology in bulk colloidal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Learning protocols for the fast and efficient control of active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to learn protocols that effect fast and efficient state-to-state transformations in simulation models of active particles. By encoding the protocol in the form of a neural network we use evolutionary methods to identify protocols that take active particles from one steady state to another, as quickly as possible or with as little energy expended as possible. Our results show that protocols identified by a flexible neural-network ansatz, which allows the optimization of multiple control parameters and the emergence of sharp features, are more efficient than protocols derived recently by constrained analytical methods. Our learning scheme is straightforward to use in experiment, suggesting a way of designing protocols for the efficient manipulation of active matter in the laboratory.</description>
