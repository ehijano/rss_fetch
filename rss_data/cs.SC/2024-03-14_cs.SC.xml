      <title>Motifs, Phrases, and Beyond: The Modelling of Structure in Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling musical structure is vital yet challenging for artificial intelligence systems that generate symbolic music compositions. This literature review dissects the evolution of techniques for incorporating coherent structure, from symbolic approaches to foundational and transformative deep learning methods that harness the power of computation and data across a wide variety of training paradigms. In the later stages, we review an emerging technique which we refer to as "sub-task decomposition" that involves decomposing music generation into separate high-level structural planning and content creation stages. Such systems incorporate some form of musical knowledge or neuro-symbolic methods by extracting melodic skeletons or structural templates to guide the generation. Progress is evident in capturing motifs and repetitions across all three eras reviewed, yet modelling the nuanced development of themes across extended compositions in the style of human composers remains difficult. We outline several key future directions to realize the synergistic benefits of combining approaches from all eras examined.</description>

      <title>Solving the p-Riccati Equations and Applications to the Factorisation of Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solutions of the equation f^{ (p--1) }+ f^p = h^p in the unknown function f overan algebraic function field of characteristic p are very closely linked to the structure and fac-torisations of linear differential operators with coefficients in function fields of characteristic p.However, while being able to solve this equation over general algebraic function fields is necessaryeven for operators with rational coefficients, no general resolution method has been developed.We present an algorithm for testing the existence of solutions in polynomial time in the ``size''of h and an algorithm based on the computation of Riemann-Roch spaces and the selection ofelements in the divisor class group, for computing solutions of size polynomial in the ``size'' of hin polynomial time in the size of h and linear in the characteristic p, and discuss its applicationsto the factorisation of linear differential operators in positive characteristic p.</description>
