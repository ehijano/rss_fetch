      <title>Parametric Algorithms for the 5-Modular Analog of ES (Sierpi\'nski): Structure of Solutions, Parameterization, and Constructive Proofs (SERP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of representing the fraction $5/P$ as a sum of three distinct unit fractions $1/A+1/B+1/C$ with $A&lt;B&lt;C$ and $A,B,C\in\mathbb{N}$. The case of primes $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ is analyzed, where two constructive types of solutions arise: ED1 (exactly one denominator divisible by $P$, namely $C=cP$) and ED2 (exactly two denominators divisible by $P$, namely $B=bP$ and $C=cP$). Parametric constructions and enumeration algorithms are developed, including explicit transitions between ED1 and ED2.
  A deterministic algorithm is proposed, based on the intersection of a parametric lattice defined by pairs $(\alpha,d')$ with bounded boxes. For each fixed prime $P\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ the algorithm constructively produces a solution. Using analytic methods such as the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem and the Chebotarev density theorem, it is shown that the density of admissible parameters is high, which yields polylogarithmic search complexity in the average case. A strict complexity guarantee for all primes remains conditional and depends on the finite covering hypothesis.
  This study extends previous work for coefficient $4$ (the Erd\H{o}s--Straus conjecture) to coefficient $5$, transferring the same structure of parametrization and constructive solutions. Analytic applications provide averaging tools used for density estimates in parametric boxes.</description>

      <title>Explicit Burgess inequalities for cubefree moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burgess proved that for $\chi_q$ a primitive Dirichlet character modulo $q$ with $q$ cubefree, $\Big|\sum_{M&lt; n\le M+N}\chi_q(n)\Big| \ll N^{1-\frac{1}{r}}q^{\frac{r+1}{4r^2}+\epsilon}$ for all integers $r\ge1.$ More recently, explicit versions with prime moduli $q$ were computed by Booker, McGown, Trevi\~{n}o, and Francis, with applications to finding the least $k$-th power residue, and bounding the size of Dirichlet $L$-functions just to name a few. Jain-Sharma, Khale, and Liu proved an explicit estimate for $r=2.$ We improve their explicit constant for $r = 2$ and compute an explicit Burgess bound for cubefree $q$ for $r\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Lower bound on N\'{e}ron-Tate height of Abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field $K$ and $\hat{h}$ be the N\'eron-Tate height on $A(\overline{K})$ corresponding to a symmetric ample line bundle on $A$. Let $\mathcal{K}/K$ be an asymptotically positive infinite extension as defined in \cite{AB-SK} which includes infinite Galois extensions with finite local degree at a non-archimedean place. In this article, we prove that the N\'eron-Tate height of non-torsion points in $A(\mathcal{K})$ is bounded below by an absolute constant depending only on $A$, $K$, and $\mathcal{K}$. As a consequence, we obtain the Bogomolov property for totally $p$-adic points of an abelian variety $A/\mathbb{Q}$ in the case when $A$ has good reduction at $p$. This is the first instance where such a result has been obtained in the good reduction case; previously, it was known only in the bad reduction case via Gubler's tropical equidistribution theorem. Moreover, our result also implies the finiteness of torsion points in $A(\mathcal{K})$.</description>

      <title>A $q$-analogue of the Koecher-Leshchiner generating function of odd zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1980s, Koecher and, independently, Leshchiner found an elegant formula for the generating function of odd zeta values. In this short note, we derive a $q$-analogue of this formula, which provides a $q$-version of the accelerated series for $\zeta(3)$ used by Ap\'ery in his famous proof of irrationality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diophantine subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ play a key role in the negative answer to Hilbert's tenth problem. The definition of diophantine set generalizes in several ways to other commutative rings. We compare these definitions. Along the way, we prove that for every finitely presented scheme $Y$ over a ring $R$, there exists an affine $R$-scheme $X$ with a finitely presented $R$-morphism $X \to Y$ such that $X(R') \to Y(R')$ is surjective for every $R$-algebra $R'$.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of function field-valued points on exceptional Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C/k$ be a smooth curve over a finite field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We prove that there are finitely many principally polarized abelian schemes of given dimension $g$ over $C$ up to $p$-power isogeny. For curves over $\overline{k}$, we prove that the moduli space of such abelian schemes is finite type up to $p$-power isogeny.
  Moreover, we generalize this result to arbitrary (not necessarily abelian type) Shimura varieties $S$ and sufficiently large primes $p$ in terms of $S$: The space of generically ordinary morphisms $C\to S_{k}$ (resp. $C\to S_{\overline{k}})$ is finite (resp. finite type) up to $p$-Hecke orbits.</description>

      <title>Variations of the Hardy Z-Function and the Montgomery Pair Correlation Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\mathcal{RH}_N(\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $\beta=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.</description>

      <title>On the non-generic part of cohomology of compact unitary Shimura varieties of signature $(1,n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we prove a result about the non-generic part of the cohomology of certain compact unitary Shimura varieties for good $p$, partially extending a result of Boyer in the case of Harris--Taylor unitary Shimura varieties. Our arguments are different to those of Boyer -- we work in the context of the work of Fargues--Scholze, using ideas introduced by Koshikawa to study the generic part of cohomology.</description>

      <title>The shifted convolution problem for Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms of degree $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a power-saving bound for certain smoothed shifted convolution sums for Fourier coefficients of Siegel cusp forms. This result is the first nontrivial estimate for a shifted convolution sum with two cusp forms on a group of higher rank than $\GL_2$. Our approach is based on a novel automorphic reinterpretation of the delta method of Duke, Friedlander, and Iwaniec. The method reduces the problem to the estimation of Fourier coefficients of Siegel Poincare series, which is ultimately based on the Weil bound.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of a Family of Painlev\'e Functions with Applications to CUE Derivative Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert method is employed to carry out an asymptotic analysis of a family of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e V functions associated with Hankel determinants involving the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind. In the large-matrix limit, this family degenerates to a family of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ functions, whose precise asymptotic behavior is also obtained. Both families of Painlev\'e functions arise in the study of the joint moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a CUE random matrix and the polynomial itself, whose asymptotics are closely related to the moments of the Riemann zeta function and the Hardy $\mathsf{Z}$-function on the critical line. One of our main results establishes a representation of the leading coefficients of these joint moments in terms of $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III$'$ functions for general real exponents. The other main result resolves a question of Assiotis et al. in [Probab. Math. Physics. 2(2021), 613-642, Remark 2.5] concerning the existence of a probability density for a random variable arising in the ergodic decomposition of Hua-Pickrell measures.</description>

      <title>On zero-sum problems over metacyclic groups $C_n \rtimes_s C_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. A finite collection of elements from $G$, where the order is disregarded and repetitions are allowed, is said to be a product-one sequence if its elements can be ordered such that their product in $G$ equals the identity element of $G$. Then, the Gao's constant $\mathsf E (G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $\ell$ such that every sequence of length at least $\ell$ has a product-one subsequence of length $|G|$. For a positive integer $n$, we denote by $C_n$ a cyclic group of order $n$. Let $G = C_n \rtimes_s C_2$ with $s^2\equiv 1\pmod n$ be a metacyclic group. The direct and inverse problems of $\mathsf E (G)$ were settled recently, except for the case that $G=C_{3n_2}\rtimes_s C_2$ with $n_2\neq 1$, $\gcd(n_2,6)=1$, $s\equiv -1 \pmod 3$, and $s\equiv 1\pmod {n_2}$. In this paper, we complete the remaining case and hence for all metacyclic groups of the form $G=C_n \rtimes C_2$, the Gao's constant and the associated inverse problem are now fully settled (see Theorem 1.2).</description>

      <title>Computing basis of solutions of any Mahler equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mahler equations arise in a wide range of contexts including the study of finite automata, regular sequences, algebraic series over Fp(z), and periods of Drinfeld modules. Introduced a century ago by K. Mahler to study the transcendence of certain complex numbers, they have recently been the subject of several works establishing a deep connection between such transcendence properties and the nature of their solutions. While numerous studies have investigated these solutions, existing algorithms can only compute them in specific rings: rational functions, power series, Puiseux series, or Hahn series. This paper solves the problem by providing an algorithm that computes a complete basis of solutions for any Mahler equation, along with a decomposition of each solution over the field of Puiseux series. Along the way, we describe an algorithm that computes a fundamental matrix of solutions for any Mahler system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amdeberhan and Merca recently studied arithmetic properties of the sequence $a(n)$, the reciprocal of the crank parity function, which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$ whose even parts are monochromatic and whose odd parts may appear in one of three colors (OEIS A298311). A key result of their work was the congruence $a(7n + 2) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ for all $n \geq 0$. We prove new congruences for the reciprocal crank parity function modulo powers of $7$.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of abelian varieties over $\overline{\mathbb Q(t)}$ with no power isogenous to a Jacobian. Moreover, given a positive integer $N$, we prove the existence of abelian varieties over $\overline{\mathbb Q(t)}$ with maximal monodromy such that the $n$th power is not isogenous to a Jacobian for $n \leq N$. We make use of an Arakelov inequality established by Lu and Zuo, as well as intersection theoretic methods, to prove our main results.</description>

Abstract: Given an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and non-zero integer $r$, the Lang--Trotter conjecture predicts a striking asymptotic formula for the number of good primes $p\leqslant x$, denoted by $\pi_{E,r}(x)$, such that the Frobenius trace of $E$ at $p$ is equal to the given integer $r$. We focus on the CM case in this memoir, and show how to realize the following two goals:
  (1) to give an unconditional estimate for $\pi_{E,r}(x)$, which confirms the upper bound part of the conjecture up to a constant multiple;
  (2) to give a conditional explicit asymptotic formula for $\pi_{E,r}(x)$ based on the Hardy--Littlewood conjecture on primes represented by quadratic polynomials.
  For completeness, we also summarize classical results on quadratic, cubic and quartic residues, as well as the corresponding reciprocity laws. This part should be of independent interests and could provide useful materials for more junior readers. We also highlight some possible extensions of the arguments in this memoir that may work for other statistical problems of CM elliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any rational cubic hypersurface of dimension at least 33 defined over a number field $K$ vanishes on a $K$-rational projective line, reducing the previous lower bound of Wooley by two. For $K=\mathbb Q$ we can reduce the bound to 29. The main ingredients are a result on linear spaces on quadratic forms over suitable non-real quadratic field extensions, and recent work of Bernert and Hochfilzer on cubic forms over imaginary quadratic number fields for the rational case.</description>

      <title>Linear quadratic Chabauty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new quadratic Chabauty method to compute the integral points on certain even degree hyperelliptic curves. Our approach relies on a nontrivial degree zero divisor supported at the two points at infinity to restrict the $p$-adic height to a linear function; we can then express this restriction in terms of holomorphic Coleman integrals under the standard quadratic Chabauty assumption. Then we use this linear relation to extract the integral points on the curve. We also generalize our method to integral points over number fields. Our method is significantly simpler and faster than all other existing versions of the quadratic Chabauty method. We give examples over $\Q$ and $\Q(\sqrt{7})$.</description>

Abstract: We study the integral Brauer--Manin obstruction for affine diagonal cubic surfaces, which we employ to construct the first counterexamples to the integral Hasse principle in this setting. We then count in three natural ways how such counterexamples are distributed across the family of affine diagonal cubic surfaces and how often such surfaces satisfy integral strong approximation off $\infty$.</description>

      <title>Minimal torsion curves in geometric isogeny classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the study of minimal torsion curves within a fixed geometric isogeny class. For a $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-isogeny class $\mathcal{E}$ of elliptic curves and $N \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, we wish to determine the least degree of a point on the modular curve $X_1(N)$ associated to any $E \in \mathcal{E}$. In the present work, we consider the cases where $\mathcal{E}$ is rational, i.e., contains an elliptic curve with rational $j$-invariant, or where $\mathcal{E}$ consists of elliptic curves with complex multiplication (CM). If $N=\ell^k$ is a power of a single prime, we give a complete characterization upon restricting to points of odd degree, and also in the case where $\mathcal{E}$ is CM. We include various partial results in the more general setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For all infinite rings $R$ that are finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}$, we show that Hilbert's tenth problem has a negative answer. This is accomplished by constructing elliptic curves $E$ without rank growth in certain quadratic extensions $L/K$. To achieve such a result unconditionally, our key innovation is to use elliptic curves $E$ with full rational $2$-torsion which allows us to combine techniques from additive combinatorics with $2$-descent.</description>

Abstract: We prove Witten zeta function of a root system $\Phi$ has high-order vanishing at negative even integers, using an integral representation involving the Hurwitz zeta function. This settles a conjecture of Kurokawa and Ochiai for a large class of compact Lie groups. We also provide a qualitative description of the corresponding leading coefficient in terms of Riemann zeta values, in which the highest root of $\Phi$ makes a natural appearance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D. Klarner on the question of P. Erd\"os about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</description>

Abstract: Denote by $\pi(x;q,a)$ the number of primes $p\leqslant x$ with $p\equiv a\bmod q.$ We prove new upper bounds for $\pi(x;q,a)$ when $q$ is a large prime very close to $\sqrt{x}$, improving upon the classical work of Iwaniec (1982). The proof reduces to bounding a quintilinear sum of Kloosterman sums, to which we introduce a new shifting argument inspired by Vinogradov--Burgess--Karatsuba, going beyond the classical Fourier-analytic approach thanks to a deep algebro-geometric result of Kowalski--Michel--Sawin on sums of products of Kloosterman sums.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Siegel modular forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f$ and $f'$ be genus $2$ cuspidal Siegel paramodular newforms. We prove that if their Hecke eigenvalues $a_p$ and $a_p'$ satisfy a non-trivial polynomial relation $P(a_p, a_p') = 0$ for a set of primes $p$ of positive density, then $f$ is a scalar multiple of a quadratic twist of $f'$. This result extends the strong multiplicity one theorem, which handles the case $P(x,y) = x - y$, to arbitrary polynomial relations.
  Our proof analyses the image of the product Galois representation attached to the pair $(f, f')$: we show that this image is as large as possible, unless $f$ is a twist of $f'$.
  Our results also apply to elliptic modular forms. They therefore provide a unified method for distinguishing both elliptic and Siegel modular forms based on their Hecke data, including their Hecke eigenvalues, Satake parameters, Sato--Tate angles, and the coefficients of their $L$-functions. We apply our methods to recover and generalise a range of existing results and to prove new ones in both the elliptic and Siegel settings.</description>

Abstract: We study small gaps between Goldbach primes $\mathbb{P} \cap (N-\mathbb{P})$ using the Bombieri-Davenport method and the Maynard-Tao method, and compare the two.
  We show that for almost all even integers $N$, the smallest gap in $\mathbb{P} \cap (N-\mathbb{P})$ is at most $0.765\ldots$ times the average gap, using the Bombieri-Davenport method. This improves a recent result of Tsuda. We also demonstrate that a straightforward application of the Maynard-Tao method is insufficient to improve this bound. However, it allows us to establish the existence of bounded gaps between Goldbach primes with bounded error for almost all even integers $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we construct an arithmetic hyperbolic $6-$orbifold $\mathcal{O}$ such that, any square-rootable Salem number of degree at most $4$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is realized as the exponential of the length of a closed geodesic in $\mathcal{O}$. We also prove that $n=6$ is the minimal dimension among arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds of the first type where it can be obtained. In an appendix, we establish a general relation between the discriminant of a Salem number and the determinant of a quadratic space which realizes it. In particular, for any $m,d&gt;0$ we present a geometric proof of the existence of Salem numbers of degree $2m$ with discriminant $(-1)^{m+1}d$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twin prime conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by two. While recent advances have improved our understanding of bounded prime gaps, the conjecture remains unresolved. This paper refines the weighted sieve method to estimate a sum over twin prime pairs, where each term is of the form \((1/p)(log(x^{{\alpha}}/p))^k\). We establish a strict positive lower bound for this sum, which implies the infinitude of twin prime pairs.</description>

      <title>The metric theory of small gaps for a sequence of real numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of distinct positive integers. The metric theory of minimal gaps for the sequence $\{\alpha a_n \text{ mod }1, 1\leq n \leq N\}$ as $N \to \infty$ was initiated by Rudnick, who established that the minimal gap admits an asymptotic upper bound expressible in terms of the additive energy of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$ for almost every $\alpha$. Later, Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch demonstrated that the metric theory of minimal gaps for such sequences is governed not by the additive energy, but by the cardinality of the difference set of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$. They established a sharp convergence test for the typical asymptotic order of the minimal gap and proved general upper and lower bounds that are readily applicable. A key element of their proof relies on the resolution of the Duffin--Schaeffer conjecture by Koukoulopoulos and Maynard. In this article, we generalise several results from the article of Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch on \emph{integer} sequences to the case of \emph{real} sequences. While an upper bound for $\delta_{\min}^{\alpha}(N)$ remains elusive, we obtain one for its floored counterpart $\lfloor \delta^{\alpha}_{\min} \rfloor (N)$ for real sequences $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ of distinct numbers. Our theorems recover Theorems 1-3, as well as the result from Section 4.3 of the article by Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the minimal gaps of well-spaced sequences and, more generally, of a broader family that contains them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Lusztig's semi-infinite Deligne--Lusztig variety for $\mathrm{GSp}$ (and its inner form) is isomorphic, as a set with action, to an affine Deligne--Lusztig variety at infinite level, generalizing a result of Chan--Ivanov. Furthermore, we show that a component of some affine Deligne--Lusztig variety $X^0_{w_r}(b)_{\mathcal{L}}$ for $\mathrm{GSp}$ can be written, up to perfection, as a direct product of a classical Deligne--Lusztig variety with an affine space. We also study the varieties $X_h$ defined by Chan and Ivanov, and show that $X_h$ at infinite level can be realized as a subset of semi-infinite Deligne--Lusztig varieties defined using components of affine Deligne--Lusztig varieties such as $X^0_{w_r}(b)_{\mathcal{L}}$ above, even in the $\mathrm{GSp}$ case. This reinterprets previous constructions of representations from $X_h$ as instances of Lusztig's conjectural picture.</description>

      <title>Topological Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to duality theorems for $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of rigid analytic spaces, we study the category of Topological Vector Spaces in the setting of condensed mathematics. We prove that it contains, as full subcategories, both the category of (topologically) bounded algebraic Vector Spaces and the category of perfect complexes on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. Vector Spaces coming from $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of smooth partially proper rigid analytic varieties are examples of sheaves belonging to the former category.</description>

      <title>An efficient quantum algorithm for computing $S$-units and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide details on the proofs of the quantum polynomial time algorithm of Biasse and Song (SODA 16) for computing the $S$-unit group of a number field. This algorithm directly implies polynomial time methods to calculate class groups, S-class groups, relative class group and the unit group, ray class groups, solve the principal ideal problem, solve certain norm equations, and decompose ideal classes in the ideal class group. Additionally, combined with a result of Cramer, Ducas, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2016), the resolution of the principal ideal problem allows one to find short generators of a principal ideal. Likewise, methods due to Cramer, Ducas and Wesolowski (Eurocrypt 2017) use the resolution of the principal ideal problem and the decomposition of ideal classes to find so-called ``mildly short vectors'' in ideal lattices of cyclotomic fields.</description>
