      <title>Enhancing Fake News Detection in Social Media via Label Propagation on Cross-modal Tweet Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fake news detection in social media has become increasingly important due to the rapid proliferation of personal media channels and the consequential dissemination of misleading information. Existing methods, which primarily rely on multimodal features and graph-based techniques, have shown promising performance in detecting fake news. However, they still face a limitation, i.e., sparsity in graph connections, which hinders capturing possible interactions among tweets. This challenge has motivated us to explore a novel method that densifies the graph's connectivity to capture denser interaction better. Our method constructs a cross-modal tweet graph using CLIP, which encodes images and text into a unified space, allowing us to extract potential connections based on similarities in text and images. We then design a Feature Contextualization Network with Label Propagation (FCN-LP) to model the interaction among tweets as well as positive or negative correlations between predicted labels of connected tweets. The propagated labels from the graph are weighted and aggregated for the final detection. To enhance the model's generalization ability to unseen events, we introduce a domain generalization loss that ensures consistent features between tweets on seen and unseen events. We use three publicly available fake news datasets, Twitter, PHEME, and Weibo, for evaluation. Our method consistently improves the performance over the state-of-the-art methods on all benchmark datasets and effectively demonstrates its aptitude for generalizing fake news detection in social media.</description>

      <title>Full-reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment Using Spectral Graph Wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point clouds in 3D applications frequently experience quality degradation during processing, e.g., scanning and compression. Reliable point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) is important for developing compression algorithms with good bitrate-quality trade-offs and techniques for quality improvement (e.g., denoising). This paper introduces a full-reference (FR) PCQA method utilizing spectral graph wavelets (SGWs). First, we propose novel SGW-based PCQA metrics that compare SGW coefficients of coordinate and color signals between reference and distorted point clouds. Second, we achieve accurate PCQA by integrating several conventional FR metrics and our SGW-based metrics using support vector regression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce SGWs for PCQA. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed PCQA metric is more accurately correlated with subjective quality scores compared to conventional PCQA metrics.</description>

      <title>SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model for Audio-Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task holds significant potential for applications. Compared to traditional unimodal approaches, the multi-modal input of AVQA makes feature extraction and fusion processes more challenging. Euclidean space is difficult to effectively represent multi-dimensional relationships of data. Especially when extracting and processing data with a tree structure or hierarchical structure, Euclidean space is not suitable as an embedding space. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers is effective in capturing the dynamic relationships between elements in a sequence. However, the self-attention mechanism's limitations in window modeling and quadratic computational complexity reduce its effectiveness in modeling long sequences. To address these limitations, we propose SHMamba: Structured Hyperbolic State Space Model to integrate the advantages of hyperbolic geometry and state space models. Specifically, SHMamba leverages the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to represent hierarchical structures and complex relationships in audio-visual data. Meanwhile, the state space model captures dynamic changes over time by globally modeling the entire sequence. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive curvature hyperbolic alignment module and a cross fusion block to enhance the understanding of hierarchical structures and the dynamic exchange of cross-modal information, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHMamba outperforms previous methods with fewer parameters and computational costs. Our learnable parameters are reduced by 78.12\%, while the average performance improves by 2.53\%. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among all current major methods and is more suitable for practical application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Understanding Pedestrian Movement Using Urban Sensing Technologies: The Promise of Audio-based Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While various sensors have been deployed to monitor vehicular flows, sensing pedestrian movement is still nascent. Yet walking is a significant mode of travel in many cities, especially those in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Understanding pedestrian volumes and flows is essential for designing safer and more attractive pedestrian infrastructure and for controlling periodic overcrowding. This study discusses a new approach to scale up urban sensing of people with the help of novel audio-based technology. It assesses the benefits and limitations of microphone-based sensors as compared to other forms of pedestrian sensing. A large-scale dataset called ASPED is presented, which includes high-quality audio recordings along with video recordings used for labeling the pedestrian count data. The baseline analyses highlight the promise of using audio sensors for pedestrian tracking, although algorithmic and technological improvements to make the sensors practically usable continue. This study also demonstrates how the data can be leveraged to predict pedestrian trajectories. Finally, it discusses the use cases and scenarios where audio-based pedestrian sensing can support better urban and transportation planning.</description>

      <title>SSTFB: Leveraging self-supervised pretext learning and temporal self-attention with feature branching for real-time video polyp segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyps are early cancer indicators, so assessing occurrences of polyps and their removal is critical. They are observed through a colonoscopy screening procedure that generates a stream of video frames. Segmenting polyps in their natural video screening procedure has several challenges, such as the co-existence of imaging artefacts, motion blur, and floating debris. Most existing polyp segmentation algorithms are developed on curated still image datasets that do not represent real-world colonoscopy. Their performance often degrades on video data. We propose a video polyp segmentation method that performs self-supervised learning as an auxiliary task and a spatial-temporal self-attention mechanism for improved representation learning. Our end-to-end configuration and joint optimisation of losses enable the network to learn more discriminative contextual features in videos. Our experimental results demonstrate an improvement with respect to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our ablation study also confirms that the choice of the proposed joint end-to-end training improves network accuracy by over 3% and nearly 10% on both the Dice similarity coefficient and intersection-over-union compared to the recently proposed method PNS+ and Polyp-PVT, respectively. Results on previously unseen video data indicate that the proposed method generalises.</description>

      <title>Enhancing multimodal cooperation via sample-level modality valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One primary topic of multimodal learning is to jointly incorporate heterogeneous information from different modalities. However most models often suffer from unsatisfactory multimodal cooperation which cannot jointly utilize all modalities well. Some methods are proposed to identify and enhance the worse learnt modality but they are often hard to provide the fine-grained observation of multimodal cooperation at sample-level with theoretical support. Hence it is essential to reasonably observe and improve the fine-grained cooperation between modalities especially when facing realistic scenarios where the modality discrepancy could vary across different samples. To this end we introduce a sample-level modality valuation metric to evaluate the contribution of each modality for each sample. Via modality valuation we observe that modality discrepancy indeed could be different at sample-level beyond the global contribution discrepancy at dataset-level. We further analyze this issue and improve cooperation between modalities at sample-level by enhancing the discriminative ability of low-contributing modalities in a targeted manner. Overall our methods reasonably observe the fine-grained uni-modal contribution and achieve considerable improvement.

      <title>CinePile: A Long Video Question Answering Dataset and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current datasets for long-form video understanding often fall short of providing genuine long-form comprehension challenges, as many tasks derived from these datasets can be successfully tackled by analyzing just one or a few random frames from a video. To address this issue, we present a novel dataset and benchmark, CinePile, specifically designed for authentic long-form video understanding. This paper details our innovative approach for creating a question-answer dataset, utilizing advanced LLMs with human-in-the-loop and building upon human-generated raw data. Our comprehensive dataset comprises 305,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), covering various visual and multimodal aspects, including temporal comprehension, understanding human-object interactions, and reasoning about events or actions within a scene. Additionally, we evaluate recent video-centric LLMs, both open-source and proprietary, on the test split of our dataset. The findings reveal that even state-of-the-art video-centric LLMs significantly lag behind human performance in these tasks, highlighting the complexity and challenge inherent in video understanding. The dataset is available at https://hf.co/datasets/tomg-group-umd/cinepile</description>

      <title>Robust Latent Representation Tuning for Image-text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large models have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in computer vision and natural language processing. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing these models with multimodal processing abilities. However, addressing the challenges posed by scenarios where one modality is absent remains a significant hurdle. In response to this issue, we propose a robust latent representation tuning method for large models. Specifically, our approach introduces a modality latent translation module to maximize the correlation between modalities, resulting in a robust representation. Following this, a newly designed fusion module is employed to facilitate information interaction between the modalities. Within this framework, common semantics are refined during training, and robust performance is achieved even in the absence of one modality. Importantly, our method maintains the frozen state of the image and text foundation models to preserve their capabilities acquired through large-scale pretraining. We conduct experiments on several public datasets, and the results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>
