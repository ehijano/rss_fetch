      <title>Finite energy subspace for time-periodic Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $N$-body Schr\"o\-dinger operators with
  time-periodic short-range pair-potentials we show by a time-dependent commutator method that all channel wave operators
  exist. For $N=2$ we prove asymptotic completeness by a simplified version of the method, recovering Yajima's completeness result \cite{Yaj1} proven by a stationary method.
  We propose a definition of a \emph{finite energy
  subspace}, intuitively consisting of states with `finite asymptotic energy'. This
  geometric notion is used to characterize the \emph{wave operator
  subspace} given as the direct sum of the ranges of the channel wave operators. Thus our main result states that the two subspaces coincide. In turn they coincide for $N= 2$ with the orthogonal subspace of the pure point subspace of
  the monodromy operator (by asymptotic
  completeness). For $N\geq 3$ asymptotic
  completeness for time-periodic short-range potentials remains an open problem. The main result of the paper may in this case potentially serve as an
  intermediate step for proving (or possibly disproving) asymptotic completeness. Another potential ingredient could be a key intermediate result of the paper, asserting that the states orthogonal to the pure point subspace obey a (sharp) \emph{minimal velocity bound}. Thus it remains an open problem possibly to derive a good maximal velocity bound for $N\geq 3$. Our results apply to $N$-body systems of particles in a time-periodic external electric field with time-mean equal to zero, for example the AC-Stark model.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory for Borel PMP Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of spectral theory for bounded-degree Borel pmp graphs. Specifically, we study spectral properties of the associated adjacency and Laplacian operators. We start with proving a spectral characterization of approximate measurable bipartiteness. Next, we adapt classical theorems of Wilf and Hoffman to give novel upper and lower bounds on the approximate measurable chromatic number. Using similar techniques, we then show that the approximate measurable chromatic number of a pmp graph generated by $n$ bounded-to-one functions is at most $2n + 1$. Next, concerning matchings, we introduce a measurable version of Tutte's condition and show that a spectral assumption analogous to the one from a classical theorem of Brouwer and Haemers implies this measurable Tutte condition. Finally, we show that the spectrum is continuous under local-global convergence.</description>

      <title>Cheeger inequalities on simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cheeger-type inequalities in which the decomposability of a graph and the spectral gap of its Laplacian mutually control each other play an important role in graph theory and network analysis, in particular in the context of expander theory. The natural problem to extend such inequalities to simplicial complexes and their higher order Eckmann Laplacians has been open for a long time. Before proving any inequality, however, one needs to identify the right Cheeger-type constant for which such an inequality can hold. Here, we solve this problem. Our solution involves and combines constructions from simplicial topology, signed graphs, Gromov filling radii and an interpolation between the standard 2-Laplacians and the analytically more difficult 1-Laplacians, for which, however, the inequalities become equalities. It is then natural to develop a general theory for $p$-Laplacians on simplicial complexes and investigate the related Cheeger-type inequalities.</description>
