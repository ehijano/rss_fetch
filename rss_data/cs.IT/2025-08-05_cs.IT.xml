      <title>Construction of $(n,n)$-functions with low differential-linear uniformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential-linear connectivity table (DLCT), introduced by Bar-On et al. at EUROCRYPT'19, is a novel tool that captures the dependency between the two subciphers involved in differential-linear attacks. This paper is devoted to exploring the differential-linear properties of $(n,n)$-functions. First, by refining specific exponential sums, we propose two classes of power functions over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ with low differential-linear uniformity (DLU). Next, we further investigate the differential-linear properties of $(n,n)$-functions that are polynomials by utilizing power functions with known DLU. Specifically, by combining a cubic function with quadratic functions, and employing generalized cyclotomic mappings, we construct several classes of $(n,n)$-functions with low DLU, including some that achieve optimal or near-optimal DLU compared to existing results.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Communication with Massive Movable Antennas: A Functional Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has provided new opportunities for capacity improvement via strategic antenna deployment, especially when the near-field effect is pronounced due to antenna proliferation. In this paper, we investigate the optimal antenna placement for maximizing the achievable rate of a point-to-point near-field channel, where the transmitter is deployed with massive movable antennas. First, we propose a novel design framework to explore the relationship between antenna positions and achievable data rate. By introducing the continuous antenna position function (APF) and antenna density function (ADF), we reformulate the antenna position design problem from the discrete to the continuous domain, which maximizes the achievable rate functional with respect to ADF. Leveraging functional analysis and variational methods, we derive the optimal ADF condition and propose a gradient-based algorithm for numerical solutions under general channel conditions. Furthermore, for the near-field line-of-sight (LoS) scenario, we present a closed-form solution for the optimal ADF, revealing the critical role of edge antenna density in enhancing the achievable rate. Finally, we propose a flexible antenna array-based deployment method that ensures practical implementation while mitigating mutual coupling issues. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with uniform circular arrays emerging as a promising geometry for balancing performance and deployment feasibility in near-field communications.</description>

      <title>Towed Movable Antenna (ToMA) Array for Ultra Secure Airborne Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel towed movable antenna (ToMA) array architecture to enhance the physical layer security of airborne communication systems. Unlike conventional onboard arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the ToMA array employs multiple subarrays mounted on flexible cables and towed by distributed drones, enabling agile deployment in three-dimensional (3D) space surrounding the central aircraft. This design significantly enlarges the effective array aperture and allows dynamic geometry reconfiguration, offering superior spatial resolution and beamforming flexibility. We consider a secure transmission scenario where an airborne transmitter communicates with multiple legitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. To ensure security, zero-forcing beamforming is employed to nullify signal leakage toward eavesdroppers. Based on the statistical distributions of locations of users and eavesdroppers, the antenna position vector (APV) of the ToMA array is optimized to maximize the users' ergodic achievable rate. Analytical results for the case of a single user and a single eavesdropper reveal the optimal APV structure that minimizes their channel correlation. For the general multiuser scenario, we develop a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm by leveraging Riemannian manifold optimization. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ToMA array achieves significant performance gains over conventional onboard FPA arrays, especially in scenarios where eavesdroppers are closely located to users under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channels.</description>

      <title>New constant-dimension subspace codes from parallel cosets of optimal Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes and multilevel inserting constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constant-dimension subspace codes (CDCs), a special class of subspace codes, have attracted significant attention due to their applications in network coding. A fundamental research problem of CDCs is to determine the maximum number of codewords under the given parameters. The paper first proposes the construction of parallel cosets of optimal Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes (FDRMCs) by employing the list of CDCs and inverse list of CDCs. Then a new class of CDCs is obtained by combining the parallel cosets of optimal FDRMCs with parallel linkage construction. Next, we present a novel set of identifying vectors and provide a new construction of CDCs via the multilevel constuction. Finally, the coset construction is inserted into the multilevel construction and three classes of large CDCs are provided, one of which is constructed by using new optimal FDRMCs. Our results establish at least 65 new lower bounds for CDCs with larger sizes than the previously best known codes.</description>

      <title>Information Rates of Approximate Message Passing for Bandlimited Direct-Detection Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity of bandlimited direct-detection channels is difficult to compute or approach because of the receiver nonlinearity. A generalized vector approximate message passing (GVAMP) detector is designed to achieve high rates with reasonable complexity. The rates increase by using multi-level coding and successive interference cancellation. The methods are applied to optical fiber channels with long intersymbol interference, as encountered in practice. Bipolar modulation operates within 0.3 bits per channel use (bpcu) of the real-alphabet coherent capacity for optically-amplified links, improving the best existing gap of 1 bpcu based on theory. Remarkably, bipolar modulation gains 6 decibels (dB) in power efficiency over unipolar modulation, and 3 dB for unamplified links. The detector is robust to changes in channel parameters such as the fiber length. The GVAMP complexity, measured in multiplications per information bit (mpib), is proportional to the number of iterations and the logarithm of the block length, and is substantially less than state-of-the-art neural networks. The receiver requires approximately 38 iterations to achieve a rate of 5 bpcu with 80 mpib.</description>

      <title>Explicit Function-Correcting Code Constructions for Lee Metric Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function-Correcting Codes (FCCs) are a novel class of codes designed to protect function evaluations of messages against errors while minimizing redundancy. A theoretical framework for systematic FCCs to channels matched to the Lee metric has been studied recently, which introduced function-correcting Lee codes (FCLCs) and also derived upper and lower bounds on their optimal redundancy. In this paper, we propose a Plotkin-like bound for irregular Lee-distance codes, which improves an existing bound. We construct explicit FCLCs for specific classes of functions, including the Lee weight, Lee weight distribution, modular sum, and locally bounded function. For these functions, lower bounds on redundancy are obtained, and our constructions are shown to be optimal in certain cases. Finally, a comparative analysis with classical Lee error-correcting codes and codes correcting errors in function values demonstrates that FCLCs can significantly reduce redundancy while preserving function correctness.</description>

      <title>Implementing Neural Networks Over-the-Air via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) OAC systems designed to emulate the fully-connected (FC) layer of a neural network (NN) via analog OAC, where the RIS and the transceivers are jointly adjusted to engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the weights of the target FC layer. We refer to this novel computational paradigm as AirFC. We first study the case in which the precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to minimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system parameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely centralized training and distributed training. In the centralized training approach, training is performed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the channel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the other terminal. In the distributed training approach, the transmitter and receiver iteratively update their parameters through back and forth transmissions by leveraging channel reciprocity, thereby avoiding CSI acquisition and significantly reducing computational complexity. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to a multi-RIS scenario by exploiting its spatial diversity gain to enhance the system performance. Simulation results show that the AirFC system realized by the RIS-aided MIMO configuration achieves satisfactory classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Robust Detection of Planted Subgraphs in Semi-Random Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs has been extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary, despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and open new directions in the study of semi-random models, computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference problems.</description>

      <title>Sequence Reconstruction over Coloring Channels for Protein Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the sequence reconstruction problem for a channel inspired by protein identification. We introduce a coloring channel, where a sequence is transmitted through a channel that deletes all symbols not belonging to a fixed subset (the coloring) of the alphabet. By extending this to a coloring profile, a tuple of distinct colorings, we analyze the channel's information rate and capacity. We prove that optimal (i.e., achieving maximum information rate) coloring profiles correspond to 2-covering designs and identify the minimal covering number required for maximum information rate, as well as the minimum number for which any coloring profile is optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) are transforming wireless physical layer technologies through their robust generalization, multitask processing, and multimodal capabilities. This article reviews recent advancements in LAM applications for physical layer communications, addressing limitations of conventional AI-based approaches. LAM applications are classified into two strategies: leveraging pre-trained LAMs and developing native LAMs designed specifically for physical layer tasks. The motivations and key frameworks of these approaches are comprehensively examined through multiple use cases. Both strategies significantly improve performance and adaptability across diverse wireless scenarios. Future research directions, including efficient architectures, interpretability, standardized datasets, and collaboration between large and small models, are proposed to advance LAM-based physical layer solutions for next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Properties and Decoding of Twisted GRS Codes and Their Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that are not equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are called non-GRS MDS codes. Alongside near MDS (NMDS) codes, they are applicable in communication, cryptography, and storage systems. From theoretical perspective, it is particularly intriguing to investigate families of linear codes in which each element can be determined to be either a non-GRS MDS or an NMDS code. Two promising candidates for such families emerge from what is known as twisted GRS (TGRS) construction. These candidates are the $(+)$-TGRS codes and their extended versions, called $(+)$-extended TGRS (ETGRS) codes.
  Although many of their properties have been characterized, there are gaps to fill. Which among the codes are non-GRS MDS? Can we improve on their decoding by using their error-correcting pairs or deep holes? In this paper we solve these problems. The answer to the first problem leads us to two classes of non-GRS MDS Hermitian self-dual TGRS codes and a proof that there is no Galois self-dual ETGRS code. Addressing the second problem, we present an explicit decoding algorithm for ETGRS codes that outperforms existing decoding algorithms given some conditions. By considering the duals of TGRS codes which are MDS, we determine the covering radius and a class of deep holes of the recently constructed non-GRS MDS codes due to Han and Zhang.</description>

      <title>CSI Obfuscation: Single-Antenna Transmitters Can Not Hide from Adversarial Multi-Antenna Radio Localization Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the minimum length of functional batch and PIR codes of fixed dimension and for a fixed list size, over an arbitrary finite field. We recover, generalize, and refine several results that were previously obtained for binary codes. We present new upper and lower bounds for the minimum length, and discuss the asymptotic behaviour of this parameter. We also compute its value for several parameter sets. The paper also offers insights into the "correct" list size to consider for the Functional Batch Conjecture over non-binary finite fields, and establishes various supporting results.</description>

      <title>RC-Gossip: Information Freshness in Clustered Networks with Rate-Changing Gossip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A clustered gossip network is considered in which a source updates its information over time, and end-nodes, organized in clusters through clusterheads, are keeping track of it. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we assess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart mechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip (RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that need it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number of fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we present an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based approach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness of nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared to traditional gossiping techniques.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial intelligence, offering unprecedented capabilities in reasoning, generalization, and zero-shot learning. These strengths open new frontiers in wireless communications, where increasing complexity and dynamics demand intelligent and adaptive solutions. This article explores the role of LLMs in transforming wireless systems across three key directions: adapting pretrained LLMs for core communication tasks, developing wireless-specific foundation models to balance versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional methods. Finally, we outline open challenges and research opportunities, including multimodal fusion, collaboration with lightweight models, and self-improving capabilities, charting a path toward intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous wireless networks of the future.</description>

Abstract: The article explores an encoding and structural information processing approach using sparse bit vectors and fixed-length linear vectors. The following are presented: a discrete method of speculative stochastic dimensionality reduction of multidimensional code and linear spaces with linear asymptotic complexity; a geometric method for obtaining discrete embeddings of an organised code space that reflect the internal structure of a given modality. The structure and properties of a code space are investigated using three modalities as examples: morphology of Russian and English languages, and immunohistochemical markers. Parallels are drawn between the resulting map of the code space layout and so-called pinwheels appearing on the mammalian neocortex. A cautious assumption is made about similarities between neocortex organisation and processes happening in our models.</description>

      <title>Estimating Reliability of Electric Vehicle Charging Ecosystem using the Principle of Maximum Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of estimating the reliability of an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging systems when facing risks such as overheating, unpredictable, weather, and cyberattacks. Traditional methods for predicting failures often rely on past data or limiting assumptions, making them ineffective for new or less common threats that results in failure. To solve this issue, we utilize the Principle of Maximum Entropy (PME), a statistical tool that estimates risks even with limited information. PME works by balancing known constraints to create an unbiased predictions without guessing missing details. Using the EV charging ecosystem as a case study, we show how PME models stress factors responsible for failure. Our findings reveal a critical insight: even minor, localized stress events can trigger disproportionately large drops in overall system reliability, similar to a domino effect. The our PME model demonstrates how high-impact components, such as the power grid, are more likely to fail as stress accumulates, creating network-wide tipping points. Beyond EVs, this approach applies to any complex system with incomplete data, such as smart grids, healthcare devices, or logistics networks. By mathematically establishing an inverse relationship between uncertainty (entropy) and reliability, our work quantifies how greater system unpredictability directly degrades robustness. This offers a universal tool to improve decision-making under unpredictable conditions. This work bridges advanced mathematics with real-world engineering, providing actionable insights for policymakers and industries to build safer, more efficient systems in our increasingly connected world.</description>

      <title>An Unconditionally Secure Encryption Scheme for IoBT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system consisting of multiple devices that want to securely communicate with each other during a mission in the presence of an adversary with unbounded computational power. The adversary has complete access to listen/read the ciphertext without tampering with the communication line. We provide an unconditionally secure encryption scheme to exchange messages among devices in the system. The main idea behind the scheme is to provide secret keys to exchange messages using a random binary matrix that is securely shared among all the devices, and pair-wise random secret keys established between each pair of devices attempting to communicate before the mission. The scheme is implemented by using finite group modular addition. We show that the scheme is absolutely semantically secure, i.e., the scheme guarantees that an adversary with unbounded computational power cannot get even one bit of information about a message, except for an exponentially small probability in a security parameter. Besides that, we show that even if the random binary matrix is revealed to the adversary, the provided scheme is computationally secure against the key recovery attack.</description>

      <title>On the Characterization and Evaluation of Doppler Squint in Wideband ODDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation has been demonstrated to enjoy excellent reliability over doubly-dispersive channels. However, most of the prior analysis tends to ignore the interactive dispersion caused by the wideband property of ODDM signal, which possibly leads to performance degradation. To solve this problem, we investigate the input-output relation of ODDM systems considering the wideband effect, which is also known as the Doppler squint effect (DSE) in the literature. The extra delay-Doppler (DD) dispersion caused by the DSE is first explicitly explained by employing the time-variant frequency response of multipath channels. Its characterization is then derived for both reduced cyclic prefix (RCP) and zero padded (ZP)-based wideband ODDM systems, where the extra DD spread and more complicated power leakage outside the peak region are presented theoretically. Numerical results are finally provided to confirm the significance of DSE. The derivations in this paper are beneficial for developing accurate signal processing techniques in ODDM-based integrated sensing and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Future Networks and Communications: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) in recent years has catalyzed transformative advances in wireless communications and networks. Among the members of the GenAI family, Diffusion Models (DMs) have risen to prominence as a powerful option, capable of handling complex, high-dimensional data distribution, as well as consistent, noise-robust performance. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and practical applications of DMs across future communication systems. We first provide an extensive tutorial of DMs and demonstrate how they can be applied to enhance optimizers, reinforcement learning and incentive mechanisms, which are popular approaches for problems in wireless networks. Then, we review and discuss the DM-based methods proposed for emerging issues in future networks and communications, including channel modeling and estimation, signal detection and data reconstruction, integrated sensing and communication, resource management in edge computing networks, semantic communications and other notable issues. We conclude the survey with highlighting technical limitations of DMs and their applications, as well as discussing future research directions.</description>

      <title>Distributed fault-tolerant quantum memories over a 2xL array of qubit modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for a quantum memory distributed over a $2 \times L$ array of modules equipped with a cyclic shift implemented via flying qubits. The logical information is distributed across the first row of $L$ modules and quantum error correction is executed using ancilla modules on the second row equipped with a cyclic shift. This work proves that quantum LDPC codes such as BB codes can maintain their performance in a distributed setting while using solely one simple connector: a cyclic shift. We propose two strategies to perform quantum error correction on a $2 \times L$ module array: (i) The cyclic layout which applies to any stabilizer codes, whereas previous results for qubit arrays are limited to CSS codes. (ii) The sparse cyclic layout, specific to bivariate bicycle (BB) codes. For the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, using the sparse cyclic layout we obtain a quantum memory with $12$ logical qubits distributed over $12$ modules, containing $12$ physical qubits each. We propose physical implementations of this architecture using flying qubits, that can be faithfully transported, and include qubits encoded in ions, neutral atoms, electrons or photons. We performed numerical simulations when modules are long ion chains and when modules are single-qubit arrays of ions showing that the distributed BB code achieves a logical error rate below $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ when the physical error rate is $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Balancing Information Accuracy and Response Timeliness in Networked LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false) queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$ LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of double and four circulant codes, which are quasi-cyclic codes of index two and four respectively. Exact enumeration results are derived for these families of codes with the prescribed hull dimension. These formulas, in turn, are the most used tools to prove the good behavior of double circulant and four circulant codes asymptotically. Computational results on the code families in consideration are provided as well.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Handover Criterion for Low-Altitude Wireless Network (LAWNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, the demand for cellular-enabled low-altitude wireless networks (LAWN) is rising significantly. The three-dimensional mobility of drones will lead to frequent handovers (HOs) in cellular networks, while traditional reference signal received power (RSRP)-based criteria may fail to capture the dynamic environment, causing redundant HOs or HO failures. To address this issue and motivated by the underutilization of sensing information in conventional HO mechanisms, we propose a novel HO activation criterion for drone systems that integrates both sensing parameters provided by integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signals and RSRP. First, we construct an ISAC signal model tailored for low-altitude scenarios and derive the Cram\'er--Rao lower bound for sensing distance estimation. Subsequently, we propose a novel joint HO criterion that extends the conventional RSRP-based method by integrating sensing information from ISAC signals, enabling more reliable HOs in dynamic drone environments. Simulation results show that the joint HO criterion outperforms the baseline RSRP-based criterion under different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensing pilot ratio conditions. Particularly, when the SNR exceeds 0dB and the sensing pilot ratio is 20%, the proposed joint HO criterion reduces the average HO region length by 75.20% and improves the activation probability by 76.31%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multi-operator wireless communication system is studied where each operator is equipped with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance its communication quality. RISs controlled by different operators affect the system performance of one another due to the inherently rapid phase shift adjustments that occur on an independent basis. The system performance of such a communication scenario is analytically studied for the practical case where spatial correlation occurs at RIS of arbitrary size. The proposed framework is quite general since it is analyzed under Nakagami-$m$ channel fading conditions. Finally, the derived analytical results are verified via numerical and simulation trials as well as some new and useful engineering outcomes are revealed.</description>

      <title>Handoff Design in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks Using DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff (HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA) observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF). Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a response time less than 0.4 ms.</description>

      <title>Distributed Iterative ML and Message Passing for Grant-Free Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing (MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks: Stochastic Performance Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and counteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive single-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as well as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's location. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays the role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly distributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for target localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. We characterize the boundary of the CRB-secrecy rate region, and interpret the performance tradeoffs between communication and sensing while guaranteeing a level of security and privacy in the random ISAC networks.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output (CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix design is employed.</description>

      <title>More on the sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function</title>

Abstract: In two papers entitled ``Two generalizations of almost perfect nonlinearity" and ``On the vector subspaces of $\mathbb F_{2^n}$ over which the multiplicative inverse function sums to zero", the first author has introduced and studied the notion of sum-freedom of vectorial functions, which expresses that a function sums to nonzero values over all affine subspaces of $\Bbb F_{2^n}$ of a given dimension $k\geq 2$, and he then focused on the $k$th order sum-freedom of the multiplicative inverse function $x\in \Bbb F_{2^n}\mapsto x^{2^n-2}$. Some general results were given for this function (in particular, the case of affine spaces that do not contain 0 was solved positively), and the cases of $k\in \{3,n-3\}$ and of $k$ not co-prime with $n$ were solved as well (negatively); but the cases of those linear subspaces of dimension $k\in [\![ 4;n-4]\!]$, co-prime with $n$, were left open. The present paper is a continuation of the previous work. After studying, from two different angles, the particular case of those linear subspaces that are stable under the Frobenius automorphism, we deduce from the second approach that, for $k$ small enough (approximately, $3\le k\leq n/10$), the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free. Finally, we extend a result previously obtained in the second paper mentioned above, and we deduce in particular that, for any even $n$ and every $2\leq k\leq n-2$, the multiplicative inverse function is not $k$th order sum-free.</description>

      <title>MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond-Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel in terms of singular values and their functions (e.g., achievable rate and harvestable power) for improved wireless performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering model and adopt a Beyond-Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for passive signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical tight bounds are derived under typical RIS deployment scenarios to unveil the channel shaping potentials of BD-RIS regarding communication Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. An efficient numerical method is then proposed to optimize BD-RIS for any locally Lipschitz function of channel singular values, and showcased to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) approach and a low-complexity shaping approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of channel singular values and the tradeoff in manipulating them, thus offering enhanced data rate, harvestable power, and physical-layer security. These advantages become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements, group size, or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission and achieve the asymptotic DoF at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its proficiency in channel shaping.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithm for Sparse Fourier Transform of Generalized $q$-ary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the Fourier transform of a $q$-ary function $f:\mathbb{Z}_{q}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which maps $q$-ary sequences to real numbers, is an important problem in mathematics with wide-ranging applications in biology, signal processing, and machine learning. Previous studies have shown that, under the sparsity assumption, the Fourier transform can be computed efficiently using fast and sample-efficient algorithms. However, in most practical settings, the function is defined over a more general space -- the space of generalized $q$-ary sequences $\mathbb{Z}_{q_1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_n}$ -- where each $\mathbb{Z}_{q_i}$ corresponds to integers modulo $q_i$. Herein, we develop GFast, a coding theoretic algorithm that computes the $S$-sparse Fourier transform of $f$ with a sample complexity of $O(Sn)$, computational complexity of $O(Sn \log N)$, and a failure probability that approaches zero as $N=\prod_{i=1}^n q_i \rightarrow \infty$ with $S = N^\delta$ for some $0 \leq \delta &lt; 1$. We show that a noise-robust version of GFast computes the transform with a sample complexity of $O(Sn^2)$ and computational complexity of $O(Sn^2 \log N)$ under the same high probability guarantees. Additionally, we demonstrate that GFast computes the sparse Fourier transform of generalized $q$-ary functions $8\times$ faster using $16\times$ fewer samples on synthetic experiments, and enables explaining real-world heart disease diagnosis and protein fitness models using up to $13\times$ fewer samples compared to existing Fourier algorithms applied to the most efficient parameterization of the models as $q$-ary functions.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Space Channel Estimation and Spatial Equalization in Wideband Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fluid Antenna System (FAS) overcomes the spatial degree-of-freedom limitations of conventional static antenna arrays in wireless communications.This capability critically depends on acquiring full Channel State Information across all accessible ports. Existing studies focus exclusively on narrowband FAS, performing channel estimation solely in the spatial domain. This work proposes a channel estimation and spatial equalization framework for wideband FAS, revealing for the first time an inherent group-sparse structure in aperture-limited FAS channels. First, we establish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics in FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from limited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By deriving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property, we prove tight recovery bounds for a convex $\ell_1/\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization formulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop a descending correlation group orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that systematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This approach enables FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior performance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or GOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, complement this with a greedy algorithm maintaining near-optimal performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel estimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables recovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence rate. The SE framework suppresses deep fading phenomena and largely reduces time consumption overhead while maintaining equivalent link reliability.</description>

      <title>LZ Penalty: An information-theoretic repetition penalty for autoregressive language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.</description>

      <title>Markov Blanket Density and Free Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05794v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics, including the minimization of variational and expected free energy, naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.</description>
