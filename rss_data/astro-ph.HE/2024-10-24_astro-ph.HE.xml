      <title>Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $53$ to $30$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also identify and measure a novel GW-gas coupling term in the in-spiral rate that makes gas effects an order of magnitude stronger than the gas-only contribution. We show that the evolution rate ($\dot a$) of the MBHB can be neatly expressed as the sum of the GW rate ($\dot a_{\rm GW}$), the pure gas-driven rate ($\dot a_{\rm gas}$), and their cross-term $\propto\dot a_{\rm GW}\dot a_{\rm gas}$. The source-frame gas-induced dephasing in the GW waveform is equivalent to losing $\sim0.5$ GW cycles over the expected $\sim1700$ cycles in a vacuum, which LISA should detect at redshift $z=1$. We also propose a phenomenological model that captures the essence of simulations and can be used to perform Bayesian inference. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications on multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Origins of the fastest stars from merger-disruption of He-CO white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) are stellar remnants moving at speeds exceeding the Milky Way's escape velocity. The origins of the fastest HVWDs are enigmatic, with proposed formation scenarios facing challenges explaining both their extreme velocities and observed properties. Here we report a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a merger between two hybrid helium-carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (HeCO WDs with masses of 0.68 and 0.62 M$_\odot$). We find that the merger leads to a partial disruption of the secondary WD, coupled with a double-detonation explosion of the primary WD. This launches the remnant core of the secondary WD at a speed of $~2000$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with observed HVWDs. The low mass of the ejected remnant and its heating from the primary WD's ejecta explain the observed luminosities and temperatures of hot HVWDs, which are otherwise difficult to reconcile with previous models. This discovery establishes a new formation channel for HVWDs and points to a previously unrecognized pathway for producing peculiar Type Ia supernovae and faint explosive transients.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Observations of SMC X-1's Excursions (MOOSE) III: X-ray Spectroscopy of a Warped, Precessing Accretion Disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MOOSE (Monitoring Observations of SMC X-1 Excursions) program uses the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer Mission (NICER) to monitor the high mass X-ray binary SMC X-1 during its superorbital period excursions. Here we perform X-ray spectral analyses of 26 NICER observations of SMC X-1, taken at the tail-end of the excursion between 2021-04-01 and 2022-01-05. We use a single spectral model to fit spectra observed in high, intermediate and low states, using a combination of a partial covering fraction model, a black-body disc, and a power-law component. We find that the partial covering fraction varies significantly with the superorbital state during superorbital excursion. Our findings suggest that the low/high state in SMC X-1 is caused by a very high obscuration of the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Blast: a Web Application for Characterizing the Host Galaxies of Astrophysical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the host galaxies of astrophysical transients is important to many areas of astrophysics, including constraining the progenitor systems of core-collapse supernovae, correcting Type Ia supernova distances, and probabilistically classifying transients without photometric or spectroscopic data. Given the increasing transient discovery rate in the coming years, there is substantial utility in providing public, transparent, reproducible, and automatic characterization for large samples of transient host galaxies. Here we present Blast, a web application that ingests live streams of transient alerts, matches transients to their host galaxies, and performs photometry on coincident archival imaging data of the host galaxy. The photometry is then used to infer both global host-galaxy properties and galaxy properties within 2 kpc of the transient location by using the Prospector Bayesian inference framework, with an acceleration in evaluation speed achieved via simulation-based inference. Blast provides host-galaxy properties to users via a web browser or an application program interface. The software can be extended to support alternative photometric or SED-fitting algorithms, and can be scaled via an asynchronous worker queue across multiple compute nodes to handle the processing of large volumes of transient alerts for upcoming transient surveys. Blast has been ingesting newly discovered transients from the Transient Name Server since mid-2024, and has currently measured SED parameters for more than 6000 transients. The service is publicly available at https://blast.scimma.org/.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the population properties of merging black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Third-generation gravitational-wave detectors will observe up to millions of merging binary black holes. With such a vast dataset, stacking events into population analyses will arguably be more important than analyzing single sources. We present the first application of population-level Fisher-matrix forecasts tailored to third-generation gravitational-wave interferometers. We implement the formalism first derived by Gair et al. and explore how future experiments such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will constrain the distributions of black-hole masses, spins, and redshift. Third-generation detectors will be transformative, improving constraints on the population hyperparameters by several orders of magnitude compared to current data. At the same time, we highlight that a single third-generation observatory and a network of detectors will deliver qualitatively similar performances. Obtaining precise measurements of some population features (e.g. peaks in the mass spectrum) will require only a few months of observations while others (e.g. the fraction of binaries with aligned spins) will instead require years if not decades. We argue population forecasts of this kind should be featured in white papers and feasibility studies aimed at developing the science case of future gravitational-wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Emission Mechanisms of Blazar PKS 1510-089: I. Multi-Wavelength Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1510-089 is one of the most active blazars in $\gamma$-rays, exhibiting phases of very high activity. This study investigates its variability over a decade across a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Utilizing the non-thermal dominance parameter, we analyze the H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, and $\lambda5100\text{ \AA}$ continuum light curves to discern the primary source of continuum emission, either from the accretion disk or the jet, during different activity phases. Our findings underscore the dominance of jet emission in the continuum during flare-like events. We observed an approximately 80-day delay between the H$\beta$ and continuum emissions, which we attribute to the spatial separation between the optical emission zone and the broad-line region. Near-zero delays between optical and near-infrared emissions suggest that the emitting regions within the jet are co-spatial. Synchrotron self-Compton was identified as the primary mechanism for $\gamma$-ray emission during flares, supported by the minimal delay observed between optical/near-infrared emissions and $\gamma$-rays. Additionally, we found a delay of about 60 days between the leading optical/near-infrared emissions and X-rays, indicating that inverse Compton scattering within the jet predominantly drives X-ray emission. However, distinguishing between synchrotron self-Compton and external inverse Compton mechanism was not feasible. Shifts in the spectral index across the 15-230 GHz range corresponded with ejections from the radio core, suggesting changes in the physical conditions of the jet.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Classification with Weighted Logistic Regression for Identifying Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important task in the study of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains the automatic classification of repeating and non-repeating sources based on their morphological properties. We propose a statistical model that considers a modified logistic regression to classify FRB sources. The classical logistic regression model is modified to accommodate the small proportion of repeaters in the data, a feature that is likely due to the sampling procedure and duration and is not a characteristic of the population of FRB sources. The weighted logistic regression hinges on the choice of a tuning parameter that represents the true proportion $\tau$ of repeating FRB sources in the entire population. The proposed method has a sound statistical foundation, direct interpretability, and operates with only 5 parameters, enabling quicker retraining with added data. Using the CHIME/FRB Collaboration sample of repeating and non-repeating FRBs and numerical experiments, we achieve a classification accuracy for repeaters of nearly 75\% or higher when $\tau$ is set in the range of $50$ to $60$\%. This implies a tentative high proportion of repeaters, which is surprising, but is also in agreement with recent estimates of $\tau$ that are obtained using other methods.</description>

      <title>The disk reverberation mapping of the lensed quasar Q0957+561</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of continuum time lags in lensed quasars can effectively probe the accretion physics of quasars. This is because microlensing observations of lensed quasars can provide constraints on the half-light radii of quasar accretion disks. By combining the microlensing results with time lag measurements, one can, for the first time, estimate the propagation velocity of the physical process that drives inter-band time lags and cross-correlations among disk emission (i.e. in UV/optical bands). In this study, we perform the disk reverberation mapping study for the well-studied lensed quasar, Q0957+561. The cross-correlation between the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) $g$ and $r$ bands was measured; the $g$ variations lead the $r$ ones by $6.4\pm 2.6$ days in the rest frame. In combination with the half-light radius from the existing literature, we find that the propagation velocity of the variability mechanism should be $1.7^{+1.5}_{-0.7}$ times the speed of light. We discuss the possible outcomes of this result. Similar studies can be applied to other lensed quasars by utilizing the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) observations.</description>

      <title>Superluminous supernova SN 2018ibb: Circumstellar shell and spectral effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I explore observational effects of the cirsumstellar gas around superluminous supernova SN~2018ibb. High velocity Fe II narrow absorptions are reproduced in the model of fragmented cold dense shell. Unusual selective absorption in the emission doublet of [O I] is explained as an effect of the radiation scattering in Si II doublet lines in the supernova envelope.The strong emission of [O III] doublet at t_max + 565 days is proposed to originate from the supernova envelope, whereas its asymmetry is explained by the dust formation in the unshocked ejecta. Circumstellar interaction modeling combined with observational data suggests the cirsumstellar shell mass of about 0.14 Msun.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger signature of cosmic rays from the microquasar V4641 Sgr propagating along a Galactic Magnetic Field line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently detected extended, very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from the microquasar V4641 Sgr reveals a puzzling 200-parsec-long jet-like structure significantly misaligned with its radio jet. We propose that this gamma-ray structure is produced by high-energy cosmic-ray particles escaping from the microquasar along ordered field lines of the Galactic Magnetic Field and interacting with the interstellar medium. We show that if the gamma-ray emission is produced by interactions of high-energy cosmic ray nuclei, the system is detectable by future multi-km3 neutrino detectors. We argue that gamma-ray observations of jet-like features adjacent to high-energy sources in the Milky Way provide a new method to measure the regular and turbulent components of the Galactic magnetic field at different locations in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Studying the X-ray absorption characteristics of Centaurus X-3 using nearly 14 years of MAXI/GSC data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centaurus X-3 is a persistent high-mass X-ray binary with the long-term light curve from the source exhibiting orbit-to-orbit intensity variations with no apparent superorbital periodicity. We used $\sim$13.5 years of MAXI/GSC data to study the long-term behaviour of X-ray absorption caused by the stellar wind from the companion star and any absorbing structures present in the binary. We used orbital-phase-resolved spectroscopy to study the variation in the photoelectric absorption along the line of sight of the source for both the intensity-averaged data and intensity-resolved data after dividing all the data binned with orbital period into three intensity levels. We find an asymmetric variation in the photoelectric absorption along the line of sight across an orbit of the source. The orbital-phase-resolved spectra show a clear increase in photoelectric absorption after $\phi_\text{orb}\sim$ 0.5, which deviates from a spherically symmetric stellar wind model. The flux of Cen X-3 shows significant variation between consecutive orbits. An intensity-resolved spectral analysis of the source was performed, followed by an intensity-resolved and orbital-phase-resolved spectral analysis, which showed that at the medium and high intensity levels, the orbital-phase-resolved photoelectric absorption is slightly asymmetric with respect to mid-phase ($\phi_\text{orb}=$ 0.5). The asymmetry is very pronounced at the lowest intensity level and cannot be explained by a spherically symmetric wind from the companion star. The differences in the orbital phase-dependence of absorption for different intensity levels suggest that the presence of an accretion wake, photoionization wake, or tidal stream is more prominent at a lower intensity level for Centaurus X-3 than at a higher intensity level.</description>

      <title>Constraining the CSM structure and progenitor mass-loss history of interacting supernovae through 3D hydrodynamic modeling: The case of SN 2014C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate SN 2014C using three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, focusing on its early interaction with dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Our objective is to uncover the pre-supernova (SN) CSM structure and constrain the progenitor star's mass-loss history prior to core collapse. Our comprehensive model traces the evolution from the progenitor star through the SN event and into the SN remnant (SNR) phase. We simulate the remnant's expansion over approximately 15 years, incorporating a CSM derived from the progenitor star's outflows through dedicated hydrodynamic simulations. Analysis reveals that the remnant interacted with a dense toroidal nebula extending from $4.3\times 10^{16}\,$cm to $1.5\times 10^{17}$ cm in the equatorial plane, with a thickness of approximately $1.2\times 10^{17}$ cm. The nebula's density peaks at approximately $3\times 10^6\,$cm$^{-3}$ at the inner boundary, gradually decreasing as $\approx r^{-2}$ at greater distances. This nebula formed due to intense mass-loss from the progenitor star between approximately 5000 and 1000 years before collapse. During this period, the maximum mass-loss rate reached about $8\times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$, ejecting $\approx 2.5\,M_{\odot}$ of stellar material into the CSM. Our model accurately reproduces Chandra and NuSTAR spectra, including the Fe K line, throughout the remnant's evolution. Notably, the Fe line is self-consistently reproduced, originating from shocked ejecta, with $\approx 0.05\,M_{\odot}$ of pure-Fe ejecta shocked during the remnant-nebula interaction. These findings suggest that the 3D geometry and density distribution of the CSM, as well as the progenitor star's mass-loss history, align with a scenario where the star was stripped through binary interaction, specifically common envelope evolution.</description>

      <title>GR-RMHD Simulations of Super-Eddington Accretion Flows onto a Neutron Star with Dipole and Quadrupole Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) are believed to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto a magnetized neutron star (NS), the detailed structures of the inflow-outflow and magnetic fields are still not well understood. We perform general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GR-RMHD) simulations of super-Eddington accretion flows onto a magnetized NS with dipole and/or quadrupole magnetic fields. Our results show that an accretion disk and optically thick outflows form outside the magnetospheric radius, while inflows aligned with magnetic field lines appear inside. When the dipole field is more prominent than the quadrupole field at the magnetospheric radius, accretion columns form near the magnetic poles, whereas a quadrupole magnetic field stronger than the dipole field results in the formation of a belt-like accretion flow near the equatorial plane. The NS spins up as the angular momentum of the accreting gas is converted into the angular momentum of the electromagnetic field, which then flows into the NS. Even if an accretion column forms near one of the magnetic poles, the observed luminosity is almost the same on both sides with the accretion column and the side without it because the radiation energy is transported to both sides through scattering. Our model suggests that galactic ULXP, Swift J0243.6+6124, has a quadrupole magnetic field of $2\times10^{13}~{\rm G}$ and a dipole magnetic field of less than $4\times10^{12}~{\rm G}$.</description>

      <title>Multimuons in cosmic-ray events as seen in ALICE at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALICE is a large experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Located 52 meters underground, its detectors are suitable to measure muons produced by cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere. In this paper, the studies of the cosmic muons registered by ALICE during Run 2 (2015--2018) are described. The analysis is limited to multimuon events defined as events with more than four detected muons ($N_\mu&gt;4$) and in the zenith angle range $0^{\circ}&lt;\theta&lt;50^{\circ}$. The results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations using three of the main hadronic interaction models describing the air shower development in the atmosphere: QGSJET-II-04, EPOS-LHC, and SIBYLL 2.3. The interval of the primary cosmic-ray energy involved in the measured muon multiplicity distribution is about $ 4 \times 10^{15}&lt;E_\mathrm{prim}&lt; 6 \times 10^{16}$~eV. In this interval none of the three models is able to describe precisely the trend of the composition of cosmic rays as the energy increases. However, QGSJET is found to be the only model capable of reproducing reasonably well the muon multiplicity distribution, assuming a heavy composition of the primary cosmic rays over the whole energy range, while SIBYLL and EPOS-LHC underpredict the number of muons in a large interval of multiplicity by more than $20\%$ and $30\%$, respectively. The rate of high muon multiplicity events ($N_\mu&gt;100$) obtained with QGSJET and SIBYLL is compatible with the data, while EPOS-LHC produces a significantly lower rate ($55\%$ of the measured rate). For both QGSJET and SIBYLL, the rate is close to the data when the composition is assumed to be dominated by heavy elements, an outcome compatible with the average energy $E_\mathrm{prim} \sim 10^{17}$~eV of these events. This result places significant constraints on more exotic production mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Radio sensitivity to a new population of millisecond pulsars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveal an excess of extended gamma-ray emission likely caused by an undiscovered population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). However, additional evidence, such as multi-wavelength searches, is necessary to confirm this theory. A significant discovery could be made if radio pulsations from individual MSPs in the Sgr dSph are detected. In this study, we investigate the possibility of detecting MSPs in the Sgr dSph with present and upcoming radio surveys using a phenomenological model based on the observed luminosity function of MSPs in the Milky Way's globular clusters. Our findings suggest that the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is the most sensitive instrument for detecting these objects. We demonstrate that to observe one MSP with MeerKAT, we would need to perform a pointing observation of the core region of the Sgr dSph for about two hours. In this same observation time, SKA can identify $9^{+5}_{-3}$ MSPs in the entire system. Based on the distance of the Sgr dSph galaxy and our dispersion measure distance estimate, we find it possible to differentiate between MSPs belonging to the Sgr dSph and those of the Galactic disk and bulge. Furthermore, the MSPs hypothesis for the Sgr dSph gamma-ray excess could be confirmed at the 99.7\% confidence level by detecting at least six MSPs in a two-hour SKA observation of the Sgr dSph.</description>

      <title>LEIA discovery of the longest-lasting and most energetic stellar X-ray flare ever detected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LEIA (Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy) detected a new X-ray transient on November 7, 2022, identified as a superflare event occurring on a nearby RS CVn-type binary HD 251108. The flux increase was also detected in follow-up observations at X-ray, UV and optical wavelengths. The flare lasted for about 40 days in soft X-ray observations, reaching a peak luminosity of ~1.1 * 10^34 erg/s in 0.5-4.0 keV, which is roughly 60 times the quiescent luminosity. Optical brightening was observed for only one night. The X-ray light curve is well described by a double "FRED" (fast rise and exponential decay) model, attributed to the cooling process of a loop arcade structure formed subsequent to the initial large loop with a half-length of ~1.9 times the radius of the host star. Time-resolved X-ray spectra were fitted with a two-temperature apec model, showing significant evolution of plasma temperature, emission measure, and metal abundance over time. The estimated energy released in the LEIA band is ~3 * 10^39 erg, suggesting this is likely the most energetic X-ray stellar flare with the longest duration detected to date.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic waveforms in LISA's science objectives with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. The scientific potential of these sources can only be fully realized with fast and accurate waveform models. In this work, we extend the \textsc{FastEMRIWaveform} (\texttt{FEW}) framework by providing fully relativistic waveforms at adiabatic order for circular, equatorial orbits in Kerr spacetime, for mass ratios up to $10^{-3}$. We study the importance of including relativistic corrections in the waveform for both vacuum and non-vacuum environments. For EMRIs in vacuum, we find that non-relativistic waveforms can result in $\sim 35\%$ error in the predicted source's horizon redshift. By developing relativistic non-vacuum EMRI waveforms, we demonstrate significant improvements in detecting environmental effects. Our analysis shows that incorporating relativistic corrections enhances constraints on accretion disks, modeled through power-law torques, and improves the constraints on disk parameters (error $\sim6\%$), representing a significant improvement from previous estimates. We also estimated the evidence for models in a scenario where ignoring the accretion disk causes bias in parameter estimation (PE) and report a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of $1.1$ in favor of the accretion disk model. Additionally, in a fully relativistic setup, we estimate the parameters of superradiant scalar clouds with high accuracy, achieving errors below $5\%$ for the scalar cloud's mass and below $0.5\%$ for the ultralight field's mass. These results demonstrate that incorporating relativistic effects greatly enhances the accuracy and reliability of waveform predictions, essential for PE and model selection.</description>

      <title>Development of convective envelopes in massive stars: Implications for gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of stellar envelopes strongly influences the course and outcome of binary mass transfer, in particular of common envelope (CE) evolution. Convective envelopes can most easily be ejected during CE events, leading to short-period binaries and potentially gravitational wave (GW) sources. Conversely, radiative envelope are thought to lead to CE mergers and Thorne-Zytkow objects (TZOs) or quasi-stars (QS). Rapid binary models based on Hurley et al. (2000) often assume that any CE event with a Hertzsprung gap donor results in a CE merger, in tension with literature. We improve this with a more self-consistent criterion based on the presence of a convective envelope. Using 1D stellar models (MESA), we systematically investigate the development of convective envelopes in massive stars. We provide fitting formulae for rapid binary codes and implement them into the StarTrack population synthesis code to refine the CE treatment and examine the impact on GW sources, TZOs, and QSs. We show that convective envelopes in massive stars are highly sensitive to the treatment of superadiabacity and the mixing length. Our revised CE model significantly reduces (factor 20) the predicted merger rate of binary black hole (BH-BH) mergers with total masses between roughly 20 and 50 Msun. This leads to a bimodal mass distribution with a strong metallicity dependence. We also predict that the current TZO/QS formation rate in the Galaxy (up to roughly 10-4 yr-1), combined with their predicted lifetimes, makes their detection unlikely. Our study strongly suggests that the role of CE evolution in the formation of BH-BH mergers has been considerably overestimated for BH-BH mergers with Mtot &gt; 20 Msun. We highlight that any prediction from the CE channel for massive BH-BH mergers (&gt;50 Msun) heavily hinges on our limited understanding of stellar structure and mass loss close to the Eddington limit.</description>

      <title>Early formation of supermassive black holes from the collapse of strongly self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence for high-redshift supermassive black holes challenges standard scenarios for how such objects form in the early universe. Here, we entertain the possibility that a fraction of the cosmological dark matter could be ultra-strongly self interacting. This would imply that gravothermal collapse occur at early times in the cores of dark matter halos, followed by accretion. We study under which conditions on the abundance and interaction strength and structure of such ultra self-interacting dark matter the black holes resulting from the end-point of gravothermal core collapse can seed the observed, early-forming supermassive black holes. We find, depending on the velocity dependence of the self-interaction cross section, a bimodal structure in the favored parameter space, where data points to either a small collapsing dark matter fraction with a large cross section, or a large fraction and a relatively small cross section. While self-interaction cross sections with different velocity dependence can explain observations, we find that the best, self-consistent results correspond to a Rutherford-like self-interaction, typical of long-range dark-sector forces with light mediators. We discuss complementary observational probes if this scenario is realized in nature, focusing especially on the expected intermediate mass black holes predicted to exist in smaller galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial state of the spherical gravitational collapse in general relativity has been studied with different methods, especially by using {\it a priori} given equations of state that describe the matter as a perfect fluid. We propose an alternative approach, in which the energy density of the perfect fluid is given as a polynomial function of the radial coordinate that is well-behaved everywhere inside the fluid. We then solve the corresponding differential equations, including the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equilibrium condition, using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and obtain a consistent model with a central perfect-fluid core surrounded by dust. We analyze the Hamiltonian constraint, the mass-to-radius relation, the boundary and physical conditions, and the stability and convergence properties of the numerical solutions. The energy density and pressure of the resulting matter distribution satisfy the standard physical conditions. The model is also consistent with the Buchdahl limit and the speed of sound conditions, even by using realistic values of compact astrophysical objects such as neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: Mennekens and Vanbeveren (2014) studied the effect of double compact star mergers on the Galactic chemical enrichment of r-process elements. LIGO merger detections since 2015 and new r-process element yields as function of neutron star + neutron star and neutron star + black hole mass requires an update of the 2014 computations.

      <title>Reconciling PTA and JWST and preparing for LISA with \texttt{POMPOCO}: a Parametrisation Of the Massive black hole POpulation for Comparison to Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a parametrised model to describe the formation and evolution of massive black holes, designed for comparisons with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. Using an extended Press-Schechter formalism, we generate dark matter halo merger trees. We then seed and evolve massive black holes through parameterised prescriptions. This approach, which avoids solving differential equations, is computationally efficient, enabling us to analyse observational data and infer the parameters of our model in a fully Bayesian framework. We find that observations of the black hole luminosity function are compatible with the nHz gravitational wave signal (likely) measured by PTAs, provided we allow for an increased luminosity function at high redshift ($4-7$), as recently suggested by JWST observations. Our model can simultaneously reproduce the bulk of the $M_*-M_{\rm BH}$ relation at $z-0$, as well as its outliers, something cosmological simulations struggle to do. The inferred model parameters are consistent with expectations from observations and more complex simulations: They favour heavier black hole seeds and short delays between halo and black hole mergers, while requiring supper-Edington accretion episodes lasting a few tens of million years, which in our model are linked to galaxy mergers. We find accretion to be suppressed in the most massive black holes below $z\simeq 2.5$, consistently with the anti-hierarchical growth hypothesis. Finally, our predictions for LISA, although fairly broad, are in agreement with previous models. Our model offers a new perspective on the apparent tensions between the black hole luminosity function and the latest JWST and PTA results. Its flexibility makes it ideal to fully exploit the potential of future gravitational wave observations of massive black hole binaries with LISA.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant perturbations of relativistic non-perfect fluids in spherical spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects are usually studied using a perfect fluid model. However, in astrophysical processes out-of-equilibrium, dissipative effects become important to describe the dynamics of the system. In this work, we obtain gauge-invariant non-spherical perturbations of a self-gravitating non-perfect fluid in spherical spacetime. We use the Gerlach-Sengupta formalism to work with gauge-invariant metric perturbations, and the Gundlach-Mart\'in-Garc\'ia approach to transform the equations of tensor perturbations into scalar equations. We calculate the dynamics of the dissipative contributions, e.g., viscosity and heat flux, using the M\"uller-Israel-Stewart equations in the gauge-invariant formalism. We obtain a set of field equations for the evolution of matter and metric perturbations in the polar and axial sectors. Specifically, in the former we find two wave equations sourced by the anisotropic contributions, and the evolution of all matter perturbations for radiative modes ($l\geq 2$). In the axial sector, we find one wave equation coupled to the evolution of matter perturbations. Finally, we comment on the contribution of dissipative effects in the lower-order multipoles ($l=0,1$) for both sectors.</description>

      <title>Formation of a magnetized hybrid star with a purely toroidal field from phase-transition-induced collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly magnetized neutron stars are popular candidates for producing detectable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals. Gravitational collapses of neutron stars triggered by a phase transition from hadrons to deconfined quarks in the cores could also release a considerable amount of energy in the form of gravitational waves and neutrinos. Hence, the formation of a magnetized hybrid star from such a \emph{phase-transition-induced collapse} is an interesting scenario for detecting all these signals. These detections may provide essential probes for the magnetic field and composition of such stars. Thus far, a dynamical study of the formation of a magnetized hybrid star from a \emph{phase-transition-induced collapse} has yet to be realized. Here, we investigate the formation of a magnetized hybrid star with a purely toroidal field and its properties through dynamical simulations. We find that the maximum values of rest-mass density and magnetic field strength increase slightly and these two quantities are coupled in phase during the formation. We then demonstrate that all microscopic and macroscopic quantities of the resulting hybrid star vary drastically when the maximum magnetic field strength goes beyond a threshold of $\sim 5 \times 10^{17}$ G but they are insensitive to the magnetic field below this threshold. Specifically, the magnetic deformation makes the rest-mass density drop significantly, suppressing the matter fraction in the mixed phase. These behaviors agree with those in the equilibrium models of previous studies. Therefore, this work provides a solid support for the magnetic effects on a hybrid star.</description>

      <title>Variable ionized disk wind in MAXI J1803-298 revealed by NICER</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results from the NICER observation data of MAXI J1803-298 across the entire 2021 outburst. In the intermediate and soft state, we detect significant absorption lines at $\sim 7.0$ keV and $\sim 6.7$ keV, arising from the X-ray disk wind outflowing with a velocity of hundreds of km per second along our line of sight. The fitting results from photoionized model suggest that the wind is driven by thermal pressure and the mass-loss rate is low. We find a clear transition for iron from predominantly H-like to predominantly He-like during the intermediate-to-soft state transition. Our results indicate this transition for iron is caused by the evolution of the illuminating spectrum and the slow change of the geometric properties of the disk wind together. The coexistence of disk wind and QPOs features in intermediate state is also reported. Our study makes MAXI J1803-298 the first source in which a transition from optical wind to X-ray wind is detected, offering new insights into the evolution of disk winds across an entire outburst and long-term coupling of accretion disks and mass outflows around accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength observations of the Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient AT2023fhn</title>

Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transients notable for their rapid rise and fade times, blue colour and accompanying luminous X-ray and radio emission. Only a handful have been studied in detail since the prototypical example AT2018cow. Their origins are currently unknown, but ongoing observations of previous and new events are placing ever stronger constraints on their progenitors. We aim to put further constraints on the LFBOT AT2023fhn, and LFBOTs as a class, using information from the multi-wavelength transient light-curve, its host galaxy and local environment. Our primary results are obtained by fitting galaxy models to the spectral energy distribution of AT2023fhn's host and local environment, and by modelling the radio light-curve of AT2023fhn as due to synchrotron self-absorbed emission from an expanding blast-wave in the circumstellar medium. We find that neither the host galaxy nor circumstellar environment of AT2023fhn are unusual compared with previous LFBOTs, but that AT2023fhn has a much lower X-ray to ultraviolet luminosity ratio than previous events. We argue that the variety in ultraviolet-optical to X-ray luminosity ratios among LFBOTs is likely due to viewing angle differences, and that the diffuse, yet young local environment of AT2023fhn - combined with a similar circumstellar medium to previous events - favours a progenitor system containing a massive star with strong winds. Plausible progenitor models in this interpretation therefore include black hole/Wolf-Rayet mergers or failed supernovae.</description>

      <title>Two black widow pulsars in the optical and X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Two millisecond pulsars, PSR J1513$-$2550 and PSR J2017$-$1614, with spin periods of about 2.1 and 2.3 ms were recently discovered in the radio and $\gamma$-rays and classified as black widow pulsars in tight binary stellar systems with orbital periods of about 4.3 and 2.3 h. Aims. Our goals are to reveal fundamental parameters of both systems and their binary components using multi-wavelength observations. Methods. We carried out the first time-series multi-band optical photometry of the objects with the 2.1-metre telescope of the Observatorio Astron\'omico Nacional San Pedro M\'artir, the 6.5-metre \magel-1 telescope, and the 10.4-metre Gran Telescopio Canarias. To derive the parameters of both systems, we fitted the obtained light curves with a model assuming heating of the companion by the pulsar. We also analysed archival X-ray data obtained with the XMM-Newton observatory. Results. For the first time, we firmly identified J1513$-$2550 in the optical and both pulsars in X-rays. The optical light curves of both systems have a single peak per orbital period with peak-to-peak amplitude of $\gtrsim2$ magnitudes. The J2017$-$1614 light curves are symmetric, while J1513$-$2550 demonstrates strong asymmetry whose nature remains unclear. Conclusions. We constrained the orbital inclinations, pulsar masses, companion temperatures and masses, as well as the distances to both systems. We also conclude that J2017$-$1614 may contain a massive neutron star of 2.4$\pm$0.6 M$_{\odot}$. The X-ray spectra of both sources can be fitted by power laws with parameters typical for black widow systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the nanohertz gravitational wave background using a $t$-process power spectral density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), which induce correlated changes in millisecond pulsars' timing residuals. PTA collaborations around the world have recently announced evidence of a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), which may be produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The GWB is often modeled as following a power-law power spectral density (PSD); however, a GWB produced by a cosmological population of SMBHBs is expected to have a more complex power spectrum due to the discrete nature of the sources. In this paper, we investigate using a $t$-process PSD to model the GWB, which allows us to fit for both the underlying power-law amplitude and spectral index as well as deviations from that power law, which may be produced by individual nearby binaries. We create simulated data sets based on the properties of the NANOGrav 15-year data set, and we demonstrate that the $t$-process PSD can accurately recover the PSD when deviations from a power-law are present. With longer timed datasets and more pulsars, we expect the sensitivity of our PTAs to improve, which will allow us to precisely measure the PSD of the GWB and study the sources producing it.</description>

      <title>GRB 211024B: an ultra-long GRB powered by magnetar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (ULGRBs) are characterized by exceptionally long-duration central engine activities, with characteristic timescales exceeding 1000 seconds. We present ground-based optical afterglow observations of the ultra-long gamma-ray burst GRB 211024B, detected by \textit{Swift}. Its X-ray light curve exhibits a characteristic ``internal plateau" with a shallow decay phase lasting approximately $\sim 15$ ks, followed by a steep decline ($\alpha_{\rm drop}\sim-7.5$). Moreover, the early optical emission predicted by the late r-band optical afterglow is significantly higher than the observed value, indicating an external shock with energy injection. To explain these observations, we propose a magnetar central engine model. The magnetar collapse into a black hole due to spin-down or hyperaccretion, leading to the observed steep break in the X-ray light curve. The afterglow model fitting reveals that the afterglow injection luminosity varies with different assumptions of the circumburst medium density, implying different potential energy sources. For the interstellar medium (ISM) case with a fixed injection end time, the energy may originate from the magnetar's dipole radiation. However, in other scenarios, relativistic jets produced by the magnetar/black hole system could be the primary energy source.</description>

      <title>TeV to PeV neutrinos from AGN coronae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to explain the TeV-PeV neutrinos observed by IceCube assuming that their sources are active galactic nuclei (AGN). The results are obtained in the model where the accretion disc emits in the UV-optical range inside the electron plasma cloud. Using the Monte-Carlo approach to model photopion interactions in jets and then after taking into account the cosmological evolution it is shown that the resulting spectrum can explain the observed neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Measuring the curvature of the universe based on the dust-scattering ring of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the use of dust-scattering rings from GRB 221009A to measure cosmic curvature. We derive the relationship between scattering angle and time delay in non-flat universes and attempt to constrain cosmological parameters by fitting theoretical predictions to observational data. The results show that this method is limited in its effectiveness due to the small geometric scale of observations. While unable to provide significant constraints, this study introduces a novel approach to cosmological measurements using GRB scattering rings. We discuss the method's limitations and potential future applications with larger-scale observations.</description>

      <title>f-mode oscillations of anisotropic neutron stars in full general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate f-mode oscillations of static anisotropic stable neutron stars within the framework of full general relativity. We present equations governing unperturbed stellar structures and oscillations with an ansatz to account for the anisotropy. We solve those equations for two different equations of states. We see that, moderately anisotropic neutron stars with the tangential pressure larger than the radial pressure can give more massive neutron stars than the isotropic or very anisotropic ones. We find that the frequency of the f-mode exhibits a linear relationship with the square root of the average density of the stars and the slope of the fit depends on the anisotropic strength. For any given value of the anisotropic strength, the frequency increases with the increase of the mass of the neutron star, linearly for lower masses, and rapidly at higher masses. However, this non-linear rise in the frequency with the mass is not prominent when the radial pressure is larger than the tangential pressure. For a fixed value of a small mass, higher anisotropy leads to a larger value of the frequency, but when the fixed mass is above a threshold value, higher anisotropy leads to a smaller value of the frequency. The nature of the variation in the frequency with the change in the anisotropic strength is similar for the two equations of state, but for a fixed mass and the same amount of the anisotropy, the softer equations of state gives higher frequency. We also find that the damping time of the f-mode oscillation decreases as the mass of the neutron star increases for all values of the anisotropic strength. For a fixed mass of the neutron star and for the same amount of the anisotropy, the value of the damping time is lower for the softer equation of state, but the nature of the variation in the damping time with the change in the anisotropic strength is similar.</description>

      <title>A novel category of environmental effect in gravitational waves from binaries perturbed by periodic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) emission of sources perturbed by periodic dynamical forces which do not cause secular evolution in the orbital elements. We construct a corresponding post-Newtonian waveform model and provide estimates for the detectability of the resulting GW phase perturbations, for both space-based and future ground-based detectors. We validate our results by performing a set of Bayesian parameter recovery experiments with post-Newtonian waveforms. We find that, in stark contrast to the more commonly studied secular dephasing, periodic phase perturbations do not suffer from degeneracies with any of the tested vacuum binary parameters. We discuss the applications of our findings to a range of possible astrophysical scenarios, finding that such periodic perturbations may be detectable for massive black hole binaries embedded in circum-binary discs, extreme mass-ratio inspirals in accretion discs, as well as stellar-mass compact objects perturbed by tidal fields. We argue that modelling conservative sub-orbital dynamics opens up a promising new avenue to detect environmental effects in binary sources of GWs that should be included in state-of-the-art waveform templates.</description>

      <title>Cosmological inhomogeneities, primordial black holes, and a hypothesis on the death of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of the expansion of the universe on a broad class of objects, including black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, and others. Using metrics that incorporate primordial inhomogeneities, the effects of a hypothetical "center of the universe" on inflation are calculated. Dynamic coordinates for black holes that account for expansions or contractions with arbitrary rates are provided. We consider the possibility that the universe may be bound to evolve into an ultimate state of "total dilution", wherein stable particles are so widely separated that physical communication among them will be impossible for eternity. This is also a scenario of "cosmic virtuality", as no wave-function collapse would occur again. We provide classical models evolving this way, based on the Majumdar-Papapetrou geometries. More realistic configurations, instead, indicate that gravitational forces locally counteract expansion, except in the universe's early stages. We comment on whether quantum phenomena may dictate that total dilution is indeed the cosmos' ultimate destiny.</description>
