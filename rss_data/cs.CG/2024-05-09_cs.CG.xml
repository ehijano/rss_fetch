      <title>Persistent homology of featured time series data and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have actively employed persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis technique, to analyze the topological information in time series data. Many successful studies have utilized graph representations of time series data for PH calculation. Given the diverse nature of time series data, it is crucial to have mechanisms that can adjust the PH calculations by incorporating domain-specific knowledge. In this context, we introduce a methodology that allows the adjustment of PH calculations by reflecting relevant domain knowledge in specific fields. We introduce the concept of featured time series, which is the pair of a time series augmented with specific features such as domain knowledge, and an influence vector that assigns a value to each feature to fine-tune the results of the PH. We then prove the stability theorem of the proposed method, which states that adjusting the influence vectors grants stability to the PH calculations. The proposed approach enables the tailored analysis of a time series based on the graph representation methodology, which makes it applicable to real-world domains. We consider two examples to verify the proposed method's advantages: anomaly detection of stock data and topological analysis of music data.</description>

      <title>Computing the Gromov--Hausdorff distance using gradient methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gromov--Hausdorff distance measures the difference in shape between metric spaces and poses a notoriously difficult problem in combinatorial optimization. We introduce its quadratic relaxation over a convex polytope whose solutions provably deliver the Gromov--Hausdorff distance. The optimality guarantee is enabled by the fact that the search space of our approach is not constrained to a generalization of bijections, unlike in other relaxations such as the Gromov--Wasserstein distance.
  We suggest conditional gradient descent for solving the relaxation in cubic time per iteration, and demonstrate its performance on metric spaces of hundreds of points. In particular, we use it to obtain a new bound of the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between the unit circle and the unit hemisphere equipped with Euclidean metric. Our approach is implemented as a Python package dGH.</description>

      <title>On RAC Drawings of Graphs with Two Bends per Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that every $n$-vertex graph that admits a 2-bend RAC drawing in the plane, where the edges are polylines with two bends per edge and any pair of edges can only cross at a right angle, has at most $20n-24$ edges for $n\geq 3$. This improves upon the previous upper bound of $74.2n$; this is the first improvement in more than 12 years. A crucial ingredient of the proof is an upper bound on the size of plane multigraphs with polyline edges in which the first and last segments are either parallel or orthogonal.</description>
