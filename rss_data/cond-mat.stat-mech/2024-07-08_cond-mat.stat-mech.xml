      <title>Bayesian Analysis Reveals the Key to Extracting Pair Potentials from Neutron Scattering Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse problem of statistical mechanics is an unsolved, century-old challenge to learn classical pair potentials directly from experimental scattering data. This problem was extensively investigated in the 20th century but was eventually eclipsed by standard methods of benchmarking pair potentials to macroscopic thermodynamic data. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that existing force field models fail to reliably reproduce fluid structures even in simple liquids, which can result in reduced transferability and substantial misrepresentations of thermophysical behavior and self-assembly. In this study, we revisited the structure inverse problem for a classical Mie fluid to determine to what extent experimental uncertainty in neutron scattering data influences the ability to recover classical pair potentials. Bayesian uncertainty quantification was used to show that structure factors with random noise smaller than 0.005 to $\sim30$ A$^{-1}$ are required to accurately recover pair potentials from neutron scattering. Notably, modern neutron instruments can achieve this precision to extract classical force models to within approximately $\pm$ 1.3 for the repulsive exponent, $\pm$ 0.068 A$^{-1}$ for atomic size, and 0.024 kcal/mol in the potential well-depth with 95\% confidence. Our results suggest the exciting possibility of improving molecular simulation accuracy through the incorporation of neutron scattering data, advancement in structural modeling, and extraction of model-independent measurements of local atomic forces in real fluids.</description>

      <title>Universal energy and magnetisation distributions in the Blume-Capel and Baxter-Wu models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the probability distribution functions of the energy and magnetisation of the two-dimensional Blume-Capel and Baxter-Wu models with spin values $S \in \{1/2,1, 3/2\}$ in the presence of a crystal field $\Delta$. By employing extensive single-spin flip Monte Carlo simulations and a recently developed method of studying the zeros of the energy probability distribution we are able to probe, with a good numerical accuracy, several critical characteristics of the transitions. Additionally, the universal aspects of these transitions are scrutinised by computing the corresponding probability distribution functions. The energy distribution has been underutilised in the literature when compared to that of the magnetisation. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the former appears to be more robust in characterising the universality class for both models upon varying the crystal field $\Delta$ than the latter. Finally, our analysis suggests that in contrast to the Blume-Capel ferromagnet, the Baxter-Wu model appears to suffer from strong finite-size effects, especially upon increasing $\Delta$ and $S$, that obscure the application of traditional finite-size scaling approaches.</description>

      <title>Work extraction with feedback control using limited resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical, biological, and even social systems are faced with the problem of how to efficiently harvest free energy from any of many possible environmental states, yet only have a limited number of harvesting strategies to choose among. We formalize this general situation within the framework of work extraction from nonequilibirum systems using feedback control. Specifically, we analyze the combined and separate effects of noisy measurements, memory limitations, and the access to only a limited set of possible control operations, quantifying the amount of extractable work under all such constraints. Such analysis allows us to provide a general recipe to construct repertoires of allowed control operations that minimize the expected losses during the feedback protocol, i.e., that minimize expected entropy production. Our results highlight the importance and benefits of feedback control over uninformed (random) actions beyond the information gain under control restrictions and are applied to several situations including uncertain initial distributions.</description>

      <title>Geometry of optimal control in chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although optimal control (OC) has been studied in stochastic thermodynamics for systems with continuous state variables, less is known in systems with discrete state variables, such as Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). Here, we develop a general theoretical framework to study OC of CRNs for changing the system from an initial distribution of states to a final distribution with minimum dissipation. We derive a ``Kirchhoff's law" for the probability current in the adiabatic limit, from which the optimal kinetic rates are determined analytically for any given probability trajectory. By using the optimal rates, we show that the total dissipation is determined by a $L_2$-distance measure in the probability space and derive an analytical expression for the metric tensor that depends on the probability distribution, network topology, and capacity of each link. Minimizing the total dissipation leads to the geodesic trajectory in the probability space and the corresponding OC protocol is determined by the Kirchhoff's law. To demonstrate our general approach, we use it to find a lower bound for the minimum dissipation that is tighter than existing bounds obtained with only global constraints. We also apply it to simple networks, e.g., fully connected 3-state CRNs with different local constraints and show that indirect pathway and non-functional transient state can play a crucial role in switching between different probability distributions efficiently. Future directions in studying OC in CRNs by using our general framework are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Swirl Structures Powered by Microswimmers in Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematics, in their pure form, have demonstrated a plethora of dynamic and steady state behaviors, including large-scale dynamic structures, collective flows, and intricate multi-spatial temporal dynamics. This complexity further increases in the presence of external polar agents. We investigate active nematics interspersed with polar microswimmers, akin to active apolar cells infused with active impurities, microswimmers. Our comprehensive numerical study reveals that varying the microswimmers' motility induces a novel spatiotemporal state in the active nematics backdrop. This state is marked by macroscopic swirl-like structures and a reduction in the overall order of the active nematics. Interestingly, this state emerges at intermediate motility levels, where microswimmers form local clusters and exhibit coherent motion. However, at higher motility levels, the swirls become less coherent, and microswimmer clustering intensifies. We show that the effect of the polar microswimmers on active nematics can be interpreted as a spatiotemporally correlated colored noise on active nematics, which promotes bend instability in active nematics, leading to the observed swirling dynamics. Our findings indicate that the spatiotemporal states are highly sensitive to the microswimmers' motility, offering potential avenues for pathogen identification based on known motility characteristics</description>

      <title>Competing nucleation pathways in nanocrystal formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite numerous efforts from numerical approaches to complement experimental measurements, several fundamental challenges have still hindered one's ability to truly provide an atomistic picture of the nucleation process in nanocrystals. Among them, our study resolves three obstacles: (1) Machine-learning force fields including long-range interactions able to capture the finesse of the underlying atomic interactions, (2) Data-driven characterization of the local ordering in a complex structural landscape associated with several crystal polymorphs and (3) Comparing results from a large range of temperatures using both brute-force and rare-event sampling. Altogether, our simulation strategy has allowed us to study zinc oxide crystallization from nano-droplet melt. Remarkably, our results show that different nucleation pathways compete depending on the investigated degree of supercooling.</description>

      <title>Functional Decomposition and Estimation of Irreversibility in Time Series via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel, simple, and flexible method to quantify irreversibility in generic high-dimensional time series based on the well-known mapping to a binary classification problem. Our approach utilizes gradient boosting for estimation, providing a model-free, nonlinear analysis able to handle large-dimensional systems while requiring minimal or no calibration. Our procedure is divided into three phases: trajectory encoding, Markovian order identification, and hypothesis testing for variable interactions. The latter is the key innovation that allows us to selectively switch off variable interactions to discern their specific contribution to irreversibility. When applied to financial markets, our findings reveal a distinctive shift: during stable periods, irreversibility is mainly related to short-term patterns, whereas in unstable periods, these short-term patterns are disrupted, leaving only contributions from stable long-term ones. This observed transition underscores the crucial importance of high-order variable interactions in understanding the dynamics of financial markets, especially in times of turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation after a global quench is a natural way to probe thermalization in closed quantum systems. When a system relaxes after the quench, thermal observables emerge in the absence of constraints, provided long-time averaging or a large system. We demonstrate a thermalization mechanism based on averaging the observables over realizations of a global quench protocol that does not rely on a system's size or long-time evolution. The quench abruptly establishes all-to-all couplings of random strength in a few-body system and initializes the dynamics. Shortly after the quench, the observables averaged over realizations of random couplings become stationary. The average occupation probabilities of many-body energy states equilibrate toward the Gibbs distribution with a finite positive or negative absolute temperature that depends on the initial state's energy, with the negative temperatures occurring due to the confined spectrum of the system. Running an experiment on an IBM Quantum computer (IBMQ) for four qubits, we report the utility of the digital quantum computer for predicting thermal observables and their fluctuations for positive or negative absolute temperatures. Implementing thermalization on IBMQ, this result facilitates probing the dynamical emergence of thermal equilibrium and, consequently, equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a neural-network architecture based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to find the ground states of quantum long-range models, specifically the transverse-field Ising model for spin-1/2 chains across different interaction regimes. Harnessing the transformer's capacity to capture long-range correlations, we compute the full phase diagram and critical properties of the model, in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. Our findings show that the ViT maintains high accuracy across the full phase diagram. We compare these results with previous numerical studies in the literature and, in particular, show that the ViT has a superior performance than a restricted-Boltzmann-machine-like ansatz.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Designing self-adaptive network with thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For real-world complex system constantly enduring perturbation, to achieve survival goal in changing yet unknown environments, the central problem is designing a self-adaptation strategy instead of fixed control strategies, which enables system to adjust its internal multi-scale structure according to environmental feedback. Inspired by thermodynamics, we develop a self-adaptive network utilizing only macroscopic information to achieve desired landscape through reconfiguring itself in unknown environments. By continuously estimating environment entropy, our designed self-adaptive network can adaptively realize desired landscape represented by topological measures. The adaptability of this network is achieved under several scenarios, including confinement on phase space and geographic constraint. The adaptation process is described by relative entropy corresponding to the Boltzmann H function, which decreases with time following unique power law distinguishing our self-adaptive network from memoryless systems. Moreover, we demonstrate the transformability of our self-adaptive network, as a critical mechanism of complex system resilience, allowing for transitions from one target landscape to another. Compared to data-driven methods, our self-adaptive network is understandable without careful choice of learning architecture and parameters. Our designed self-adaptive network could help to understand system intelligence through the lens of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Smectic-like bundle formation of planktonic bacteria upon nutrient starvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria aggregate through various intercellular interactions to build biofilms, but the effect of environmental changes thereupon remains largely unexplored. Here, by using an experimental device that overcomes past difficulties, we observed the collective response of Escherichia coli aggregates against dynamic changes in the growth condition. We discovered that nutrient starvation caused bacterial cells to arrange themselves into bundle-shaped clusters, developing a structure akin to that of smectic liquid crystal. The degree of the smectic-like bundle order was evaluated by a deep learning approach. Our experiments suggest that both the depletion attraction by extracellular polymeric substances and the growth arrest are essential for the bundle formation. Since these effects of nutrient starvation at the single-cell level are common to many bacterial species, bundle formation might also be common collective behavior that bacterial cells may exhibit under harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Emergent Mesoscale Correlations in Active Solids with Noisy Chiral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the linear response theory for an elastic solid composed of active Brownian particles with intrinsic individual chirality, deriving both a normal mode formulation and a continuum elastic formulation. Using this theory, we compute analytically the velocity correlations and energy spectra under different conditions, showing an excellent agreement with simulations. We generate the corresponding phase diagram, identifying chiral and achiral disordered regimes (for high chirality or noise levels), as well as chiral and achiral states with mesoscopic-range order (for low chirality and noise). The chiral ordered states display mesoscopic spatial correlations and oscillating time correlations, but no wave propagation. In the high chirality regime, we find a peak in the elastic energy spectrum that leads to a non-monotonic behavior with increasing noise strength that is consistent with the emergence of the `hammering' state recently identified in chiral glasses. Finally, we show numerically that our theory, despite its linear response nature, can be applied beyond the idealized homogeneous solid assumed in our derivations. Indeed, by increasing the level of activity, we show that it remains a good approximation of the system dynamics until just below the melting transition. In addition, we show that there is still an excellent agreement between our analytical results and simulations when we extend our results to heterogeneous solids composed of mixtures of active particles with different intrinsic chirality and noise levels. Our work provides a thorough analytical and numerical description of the emergent states in a densely packed system of chiral self-propelled Brownian disks, thus allowing a detailed understanding of the phases and dynamics identified in a minimal chiral active systems.</description>

      <title>Vortex reversal is a precursor of confined bacterial turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active turbulence, or chaotic self-organized collective motion, is often observed in concentrated suspensions of motile bacteria and other systems of self-propelled interacting agents. To date, there is no fundamental understanding of how geometrical confinement orchestrates active turbulence and alters its physical properties. Here, by combining large-scale experiments, computer modeling, and analytical theory, we have discovered a generic sequence of transitions occurring in bacterial suspensions confined in cylindrical wells of varying radii. With increasing the well's radius, we observed that persistent vortex motion gives way to periodic vortex reversals, four-vortex pulsations, and then well-developed active turbulence. Using computational modeling and analytical theory, we have shown that vortex reversal results from the nonlinear interaction of the first three azimuthal modes that become unstable with the radius increase. The analytical results account for our key experimental findings. To further validate our approach, we reconstructed equations of motion from experimental data. Our findings shed light on the universal properties of confined bacterial active matter and can be applied to various biological and synthetic active systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercriticality in the Ising Model and Rydberg Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercriticality, featured with universal scaling behaviors, emerges as an intriguing phenomenon proximate to the classical liquid-gas critical point. In this study, we extend this significant concept to quantum many-body systems near the quantum critical point (QCP), employing tensor network calculations and scaling analyses of the Ising model and Rydberg atom array. The supercritical, fluid-like, quantum states are found to be strongly fluctuating and highly entangled, as characterized by the universal scalings in susceptibility $\chi_z \sim (h_x-h_x^c)^{-\gamma}$, correlation length $\xi \sim (h_x-h_x^c)^{-\nu}$, fidelity susceptibility $\chi_F \sim (h_x - h_x^c)^{d\nu - 2}$, and entanglement entropy $S_{\rm E} \sim \ln{(h_x - h_x^c)}$. Here, $\gamma$ and $\nu$ represent critical exponents, $d$ is the dimension of the system, and $h_x^c$ is the critical transverse field of the Ising QCP. The universal scaling behaviors are revealed in the regime enclosed by two quantum supercritical crossover lines in the longitudinal-transverse field ($h_z$-$h_x$) plane, $|h_z| \propto (h_x - h_x^c)^{\beta + \gamma}$ relating to critical exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, where the response functions, measures of entanglement, and fidelity susceptibility reach their maxima. We propose that Rydberg atom arrays and quantum Ising magnets provide available platforms for exploring emergent supercritical phenomena and identifying the universal scalings. The present work establishes a foundation for exploring quantum supercriticality in magnetic systems and through quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Anomalous behaviour of transport properties in a supercooled water-glycerol mixture</title>

Abstract: Glycerol acts as a natural cryoprotectant by depressing the temperature of ice nucleation and slowing down the dynamics of water mixtures. In this work we characterize dynamics -- diffusion, viscosity, and hydrogen-bond dynamics -- as well as density anomaly and structure of water mixtures with 1\% to 50\% w/w glycerol at low temperatures via molecular dynamics simulations using all-atom and coarse-grained models. Simulations reveal distinct violations of the Stokes-Einsten relation in the low temperature regime for water and glycerol. Deviations are positive for water at all concentrations, and positive for glycerol in very dilute solutions but turning negative in concentrated ones. The all-atom and coarse-grained models reveal an unexpected crossover in the dynamics of the 1% and 10 % w/w glycerol at the lowest simulated temperatures. This crossover manifests in the diffusion coefficients of water and glycerol, as well as in the viscosity and lifetime of hydrogen-bonds in water. We interpret that the crossover originates on the opposing dependence with glycerol concentration of the two factors controlling the solution's slow-down: the increase in tetrahedrally coordinated water and the dynamics and clustering of the glycerol molecules. We anticipate that this dynamic crossover will also occur for solution of water with other polyols.</description>

      <title>Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures</title>

Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay concerning distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been established for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement is corroborated to exist by the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the `entanglement Hamiltonian' or `Hamiltonian of mean force.' As one outcome of our analyses, we enhance the prior clustering theorem concerning bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional quantum spin glasses guided by neural network states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to simulate the ground state of a short-range quantum spin-glass model, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian with transverse field, featuring Gaussian nearest-neighbor couplings. We numerically demonstrate that guiding wave functions based on self-learned neural networks suppress the population control bias below modest statistical uncertainties, at least up to a hundred spins. By projecting a two-fold replicated Hamiltonian, the spin overlap is determined. A finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate the critical transverse field where the spin-glass transition occurs, as well as the critical exponents of the correlation length and the spin-glass susceptibility. For the latter two, good agreement is found with recent estimates from the literature for different random couplings. We also address the spin-overlap distribution within the spin-glass phase, finding that, for the workable system sizes, it displays a non-trivial double-peak shape with large weight at zero overlap.</description>

      <title>Persistent coherent many-body oscillations in a non-integrable quantum Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify persistent oscillations in a nonintegrable quantum Ising chain left behind by a rapid transition into a ferromagnetic phase. In the integrable chain with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions, the nature, origin, and decay of post-transition oscillations are tied to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when coupling to the next nearest neighbor (NNN) is added, the resulting nonintegrable Ising chain (still in the quantum Ising chain universality class) supports persistent post-transition oscillation: KZM-like oscillations turn into persistent oscillations of transverse magnetization. Their longevity in our simulations is likely limited only by the numerical accuracy. Their period differs from the decaying KZM oscillation but their amplitude depends on quench rate. Moreover, they can be excited by driving in resonance with the excitations' energy gap. Thus, while one might have expected that the integrability-breaking NNN coupling would facilitate relaxation, the oscillations we identify are persistent. At low to medium transverse fields, they are associated with Cooper pairs of Bogoliubov quasiparticles -- kinks. This oscillation of the pair condensate is a manifestation of quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Freezing and Shielding under Global Quenches for Long-Range Interacting Many-Body Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of a Fermi-Hubbard model with long range hopping following a sudden quench of the local interactions among different spin species. The quasi-particle spectrum consists of gapped low-energy levels while the high energy modes accumulate at a single point. When the low energy gaps are large enough, turning on the local interactions does not effectively mix high and low energy modes, leading to the freezing of the dynamical evolution. In general, the states within the excited subspace are shielded from the long-range signatures of the model, which are responsible for the low energy extended states, and the dynamics effectively look as if long-range hopping were absent. This cooperative shielding mechanism becomes evident in presence of disorder. It is shown that shielding and freezing are a universal feature of long-range interacting systems and conjecture that they are related to the existence of quasi-stationary states.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gated First-Passage Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gated first-passage processes, where completion depends on both hitting a target and satisfying additional constraints, are prevalent across various fields. Despite their significance, analytical solutions to basic problems remain unknown, e.g. the detection time of a diffusing particle by a gated interval, disk, or sphere. In this paper, we elucidate the challenges posed by continuous gated first-passage processes and present a renewal framework to overcome them. This framework offers a unified approach for a wide range of problems, including those with single-point, half-line, and interval targets. The latter have so far evaded exact solutions. Our analysis reveals that solutions to gated problems can be obtained directly from the ungated dynamics. This, in turn, reveals universal properties and asymptotic behaviors, shedding light on cryptic intermediate-time regimes and refining the notion of high-crypticity for continuous-space gated processes. Moreover, we extend our formalism to higher dimensions, showcasing its versatility and applicability. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of continuous gated first-passage processes and offers analytical tools for studying them across diverse domains.</description>

Abstract: The distribution of the first-passage time (FPT)$T_a$ for a Brownian particle with drift $\mu$ subject to hitting an absorber at a level $a&gt;0$ is well-known and given by its density $\gamma(t) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2 \pi t^3} } e^{-\frac{(a-\mu t)^2}{2 t}}, t&gt;0$, which is normalized only if $\mu \geq 0$. This article demonstrates the existence of two additional diffusion process categories (one with one parameter and the other with two) that have the same first passage-time distributions when $\mu &lt;0$. For both, we identify the transition densities and thoroughly investigate the processes. A substantial implication is that the first-passage time distribution does not indicate whether the process originates from a drifted Brownian motion or from one of the new processes presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and kinetics of crystallization of nanoparticles, as opposed to bulk phases, may be influenced by surface and size effects. We investigate the importance of such factors in the crystallization process of gold, silver, and iron nanodroplets using numerical simulations in the form of molecular dynamics combined with path sampling. This modeling strategy is targeted at obtaining representative ensembles of structures located at the transition state of the crystallization process. A structural analysis of the transition state ensembles reveals that both the average size and location of the critical nucleation cluster are influenced by surface and nanoscale size effets. Furthermore, we also show that transition state structures in smaller nanodroplets exhibit a more ordered liquid phase, and differentiating between a well-ordered critical cluster and its surrounding disordered liquid phase becomes less evident. All in all, these findings demonstrate that crystallization mechanisms in nanoparticles go beyond the assumptions of classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a classic result that certain interacting integrable spin chains host robust edge modes known as strong zero modes (SZMs). In this work, we extend this result to the Floquet setting of local quantum circuits, focusing on a prototypical model providing an integrable Trotterization for the evolution of the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. By exploiting the algebraic structures of integrability, we show that an exact SZM operator can be constructed for these integrable quantum circuits in certain regions of parameter space. Our construction, which recovers a well-known result by Paul Fendley in the continuous-time limit, relies on a set of commuting transfer matrices known from integrability, and allows us to easily prove important properties of the SZM, including normalizabilty. Our approach is different from previous methods and could be of independent interest even in the Hamiltonian setting. Our predictions, which are corroborated by numerical simulations of infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, are potentially interesting for implementations of the XXZ quantum circuit on available quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations in the average speed or current of a self-interacting diffusion (SID) on a ring, mimicking the non-Markovian behaviour of an agent influenced by its own path. We derive the SID's phase diagram, showing a delocalisation-localisation phase transition from self-repelling to self-attracting. Current fluctuations are analysed using: (i) an adiabatic approximation, where the system reaches its stationary distribution before developing current fluctuations, and (ii) an original extension of level 2.5 large deviations for Markov processes. The latter, combined with perturbation theory, provides an upper bound to current fluctuations, which is tight in the self-repelling region, while the former approximates current fluctuations well in all regimes. Both methods accurately estimate the asymptotic variance and suggests a phase transition at the onset of the localised regime.</description>

Abstract: We use dynamic equations to derive a relation between correlation functions and response or relaxation functions in many-body systems. The relation is very general and holds both in equilibrium, when the usual fluctuation-dissipation theorem is valid, and to linear order in an expansion about arbitrary non-equilibrium states, when it is not. We illustrate our results by discussing fluids, both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium states, as well as several active-matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models, which is a trade-off relationship between the speed and accuracy of data generation in diffusion models. Our result implies that the entropy production rate in the forward process affects the errors in data generation. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the conservative force in stochastic thermodynamics and the geodesic of space by the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models with different noise schedules such as the cosine schedule, the conditional optimal transport, and the optimal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1802.04588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct pseudo-Gaussian orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $ \mathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When $\lambda \mu &gt;0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu &lt;0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues display intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01736v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in the 2d Ising Model with a weak bidimensional quasi-periodic disorder in the interaction, the critical behavior is the same as in the non-disordered case, that is the critical exponents for the specific heat and energy-energy correlations are identical and no logarithmic corrections are present. The disorder produces a quasi-periodic modulation of the amplitude of the correlations and a renormalization of the velocities, that is the coefficients of the rescaling of positions, and of the critical temperature. The result establishes the validity of the prediction based on the Harris-Luck criterion and it provides the first rigorous proof of universality in the Ising model in presence of quasi-periodic disorder in both directions and for any angle. Small divisors are controlled assuming a Diophantine condition on the frequencies and convergence of the series is proved by Renormalization Group analysis.</description>

      <title>$1/f$ noise in semiconductors arising from the heterogeneous detrapping process of individual charge carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07009v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of $1/f$ noise in semiconductors based on the drift of individual charge carriers and their interaction with the trapping centers. We assume that the trapping centers are homogeneously distributed in the material. The trapping centers are assumed to be heterogeneous and have unique detrapping rates. We show that uniform detrapping rate distribution emerges as a natural consequence of the vacant trap depths following the Boltzmann distribution, and the detrapping process obeying Arrhenius law. When these laws apply, and if the trapping rate is low in comparison to the maximum detrapping rate, $1/f$ noise in the form of Hooge's relation is recovered. Hooge's parameter, $\alpha_{H}$, is shown to be a ratio between the characteristic trapping rate and the maximum detrapping rate. The proposed model implies that $1/f$ noise arises from the temporal charge carrier number fluctuations, not from the spatial mobility fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The Resident Space Objects Network: a complex system approach for shaping space sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14795v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near-Earth space continues to be the focus of critical services and capabilities provided to the society. With the steady increase of space traffic, the number of Resident Space Objects (RSOs) has recently boomed in the context of growing concern due to space debris. The need of a holistic and unified approach for addressing orbital collisions, assess the global in-orbit risk, and define sustainable practices for space traffic management has emerged as a major societal challenge. Here, we introduce and discuss a versatile framework rooted on the use of the complex network paradigm to introduce a novel risk index for space sustainability criteria. With an entirely data-driven, but flexible, formulation, we introduce the Resident Space Object Network (RSONet) by connecting RSOs that experience near-collisions events over a finite-time window. The structural collisional properties of RSOs are thus encoded into the RSONet and analysed with the tools of network science. We formulate a geometrical index highlighting the key role of specific RSOs in building up the risk of collisions with respect to the rest of the population. Practical applications based on Two-Line Elements and Conjunction Data Message databases are presented.</description>

      <title>Controlled expansion for transport in a class of non-Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids arise when strong interactions destroy stable fermionic quasiparticles. The simplest models featuring this phenomenon involve a Fermi surface coupled to fluctuating gapless bosonic order parameter fields, broadly referred to as "Hertz-Millis" models. We revisit a controlled approach to Hertz-Millis models that combines an expansion in the inverse number ($N$) of fermion species with an expansion in the deviation of the boson dynamical critical exponent $z$ from 2. The structure of the expansion is found to be qualitatively different in the quantum critical regime $\Omega \ll q$ and in the transport regime $\Omega \gg q$. In particular, correlation functions in the transport regime involve infinitely many diagrams at each order in perturbation theory. We provide an explicit and tractable recipe to classify and resum these diagrams. For the simplest Hertz-Millis models, we show that this recipe is consistent with non-perturbative anomaly arguments and correctly captures the fixed point optical conductivity as well as leading corrections from irrelevant operators. We comment on potential applications of this expansion to transport in more complicated Hertz-Millis models as well as certain beyond-Landau metallic quantum critical points.</description>

      <title>Easy bootstrap for the 3D Ising model: a hybrid approach of the lightcone bootstrap and error minimization methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a simple lattice model that exhibits a phase transition, the Ising model plays a fundamental role in statistical and condensed matter physics. The Ising transition is realized by physical systems, such as the liquid-vapor transition. Its continuum limit also furnishes a basic example of interacting quantum field theories and universality classes. Motivated by a recent hybrid bootstrap study of the quantum quartic oscillator, we revisit the conformal bootstrap approach to the 3D Ising model at criticality, without resorting to positivity constraints. We use at most 10 nonperturbative crossing constraints at low derivatives from the Taylor expansion around a crossing symmetric point. The high-lying contributions are approximated by simple analytic formulae deduced from the lightcone singularity structure. Surprisingly, the low-lying properties are determined to good accuracy by this computationally very cheap approach. For instance, the results for the two relevant scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma,\Delta_\epsilon)\approx (0.518153,1.41278)$ are close to the most precise rigorous bounds obtained at a much higher computational cost.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Magnetism and Superconductivity in Isolated Correlated Flat Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-orbital electronic models hosting a non-trivial band-topology in the regime of strong electronic interactions are an ideal playground for exploring a host of complex phenomenology. We consider here a sign-problem-free and time-reversal symmetric model with isolated topological (chern) bands involving both spin and valley degrees of freedom in the presence of a class of repulsive electronic interactions. Using a combination of numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo computations and analytical field-theoretic considerations we analyze the phase-diagram as a function of the flat-band filling, temperature and relative interaction strength. The low-energy physics is described in terms of a set of intertwined orders -- a spin-valley hall (SVH) insulator and a spin-singlet superconductor (SC). Our low-temperature phase diagram can be understood in terms of an effective SO(4) pseudo-spin non-linear sigma model. Our work paves the way for building more refined and minimal models of realistic materials, including moir\'e systems, to study the universal aspects of competing insulating phases and superconductivity in the presence of non-trivial band-topology.</description>

      <title>Local heat current flow in ballistic phonon transport of graphene nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the non-equilibrium Green's function method, we study the local heat current flow of phonons in nanoscale ballistic graphene nanoribbon, where boundary scattering leads to the formation of atomic-scale current vortices. We further map out the atomic temperature distribution in the ribbon with B\"uttiker's probe approach. From the heat current and temperature distribution, we observe inverted temperature response in the ribbon, where the heat current direction goes from the colder to the hotter region. Moreover, we show that atomic scale defect can generate heat vortex at certain frequency, but it is averaged out when including contributions from all the phonon modes. Meanwhile, our results have recovered residual-resistivity dipole features manifested at the vicinity of local defects. These results extend the study of local heat vortex and negative temperature response in the bulk hydrodynamic regime to the atomic-scale ballistic regime, further confirming boundary scattering is crucial to generate backflow of heat current.</description>

      <title>Rationally independent free fermions with local hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rationally independent free fermions are those where sums of single-particle energies multiplied by arbitrary rational coefficients vanish only if the coefficients are all zero. This property guaranties that they have no degeneracies in the many-body spectrum and gives them relaxation properties more similar to those of generic systems. Using classic results from number theory we provide minimal examples of rationally independent free fermion models for every system size in one dimension. This is accomplished by considering a free fermion model with a chemical potential, and hopping terms corresponding to all the divisors of the number of sites, each one with an incommensurate complex amplitude. We further discuss the many-body spectral statistics for these models and show that local probes -- like the ratio of consecutive level spacings -- look very similar to what is expected for the Poisson statistics. We however demonstrate that free fermion models can never have Poisson statistics with an analysis of the moments of the spectral form factor.</description>

      <title>One point functions in large $N$ vector models at finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the thermal one point function of higher spin currents in the critical model of $U(N)$ complex scalars interacting with a quartic potential and the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model of Dirac fermions at large $N$ and strong coupling using the Euclidean inversion formula. These models are considered in odd space time dimensions $d$ and held at finite temperature and finite real chemical potential $\mu$ measured in units of the temperature. We show that these one point functions simplify both at large spin and large $d$. At large spin, the one point functions behave as though the theory is free, the chemical potential appears through a simple pre-factor which is either $\cosh\mu$ or $\sinh\mu$ depending on whether the spin is even or odd. At large $d$, but at finite spin and chemical potential, the 1-point functions are suppressed exponentially in $d$ compared to the free theory. We study a fixed point of the critical Gross-Neveu model in $d=3$ with 1-point functions exhibiting a branch cut in the chemical potential plane. The critical exponent for the free energy or the pressure at the branch point is $3/2$ which coincides with the mean field exponent of the Lee-Yang edge singularity for repulsive core interactions.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for 1-matric quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of Krylov complexity, a measure of operator growth, within the framework of 1-matrix quantum mechanics (1-MQM). Krylov complexity quantifies how an operator evolves over time by expanding it in a series of nested commutators with the Hamiltonian. We analyze the Lanczos coefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear growth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic behavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both ground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of complexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further studies in more complex holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Probing Random-Bond Disorder Effects on Ferromagnetic Skyrmion Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examined the impact of disorder in a ferromagnetic skyrmion lattice by introducing random-bond disorder based on two different models for both exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions: Model I, where both interactions present the same disorder distribution and thus the same local distortion, and Model II, where both interactions have different disorder distributions. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we explored the effect of bond disorder on the emergent phases induced by an external magnetic field at different temperatures, varying the disorder amplitude across a range from weak (10%) to strong (200%) regimes. Our study shows that for both models, moderate disorder at low magnetic fields breaks the helical order and induces a topologically non-trivial bimeron phase. We also found that the skyrmion lattice phase loses its periodicity, but surprisingly, the resulting phases retain topological characteristics up to high disorder amplitudes. Moreover, a significant difference between both disorder models is found at large magnetic fields: while in the first model, the high-field skyrmion phase is suppressed by disorder, in the second model, this phase is enhanced and expanded in temperature and magnetic field. Furthermore, for the second model, intermediate values of disorder induce a diluted skyrmion phase and chiral textures emerging from the ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures. Our results are relevant for layered magnets and provide valuable insights into the intricate behavior of skyrmion systems under varying disorder conditions.</description>

      <title>The Nambu-Goto string as higher-derivative Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I propose a generalization of the Liouville action which corresponds to the Nambu-Goto string like the usual Liouville action corresponds to the Polyakov string. The two differ by higher-derivative terms which are negligible classically but revive quantumly. An equivalence with the four-derivative action suggests that the Nambu-Goto string in four dimensions can be described by the (4,3) minimal model analogouslyly to the critical Ising model on a dynamical lattice. While critical indices are the same as in the usual Liouville theory, the domain of applicability becomes broader.</description>
