      <title>On Tempered Ultradistributions in Classical Morrey Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of tempered ultradistributions in classical Morrey spaces by preserving their respective properties. Moreover we investigate some embedding results within the scale of classical Morrey spaces (local Morrey space $\mathcal{L}^{p,\beta}(\mathbb{C}^{n},\mu)$ or global Morrey space $L^{p,\beta}(\mathbb{C}^{n})$ where the underlying functions $\mu$ satisfy the growth condition by polxnomials. Finally we present some results on the new classical Morrey spaces described by tempered ultradistributions satisfying both the vanishing and slow growth conditions in form of embedding theorems.</description>

      <title>Essential Self-Adjointness of Semi-Bounded Schrodinger Operators on Birth-Death Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the essential self-adjointness of semi-bounded Schr\"{o}dinger operators on birth-death chains. First, we offer a general characterization which originates from studying a second order linear recurrence with variational coefficients which comes from the Schr\"{o}dinger operator. As this characterization is algebraically complicated, we present an additional theorem discussing the failure of essential self-adjointness. Finally, we study two specific cases of solutions to equations involving the Schr\"{o}dinger operator over birth-death chains and derive explicit formulas in these cases.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture about generalized integration operators on Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture posed by Chalmoukis in 2020 states that if $T_{g,a}:H^p\to H^q(0&lt;q&lt;p&lt;\infty)$ is bounded, then $g$ must be in $H^{\frac{pq}{p-q}}$. In this article, we provide a positive answer to the aforementioned conjecture. We also consider the compactness of $T_{g,a}:H^p\to H^q(0&lt;q&lt;p&lt;\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Duality between Y-convexity and $Y^{\times}$-concavity of linear operators between Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Y-convexity, a property which is obtained by considering a real Banach sequence lattice Y instead of $\ell^p$ for a linear operator $T : E \rightarrow X$, where E is a Banach space and X is a Banach lattice. We introduce some vector sequence spaces in order to characterize the Y-convexity of T by means of the continuity of an associated operator $\overline{T}$. Analogous results for Y-concavity are also obtained. Finally, the duality between Y-convexity and $Y^{\times}$-concavity is proven.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Ces`aro operator on the Hardy space in the upper half-plane. We provide a new simple proof of the boundedness of this operator, prove that this operator is equal to the sum of the identity operator and a unitary operator, which implies its normality.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality and Its Implications for Numerical Radius Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish an improvement of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let $x, y \in \mathcal{H},$ and let $f: (0,1) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ be a well-defined function, where $\mathbb{R}^+$ denote the set of all positive real numbers. Then \[|\langle x, y \rangle|^2 \leq \frac{f(t)}{1+f(t)} \|x\|^2 \|y\|^2 + \frac{1}{1+ f(t)} |\langle x, y \rangle | \|x\|\|y\|. \] We have applied this result to derive new and improved upper bounds for the numerical radius.</description>

      <title>New Exponential operators connected with a^2+x^2: a generalization of Post-Widder and Ismail May</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study offers a general exponential operator connected with a^2+x^2; for positive real "a". We estimate the asymptotic formula for simultaneous and ordinary approximation of the constructed operator. In the last section, we graphically interpret the created operator's convergence to two periodic functions "x sin(x)" and "-x/2*cos(pi*x)". We also consider the limiting case a tends to 0; which provides Post-Widder operator. In addition, we analyze each particular case of the defined operator and determine the optimal value of "a", that would yield the greatest approximation; this facilitates us to contrast the well-known operators existing in the literature, especially the Post-Widder operator and the operator due to Ismail-May.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-free spaces over strongly countable-dimensional spaces and approximation properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a compact, metrisable and strongly countable-dimensional topological space. Let $\mathcal{M}^T$ be the set of all metrics $d$ on $T$ compatible with its topology, and equip $\mathcal{M}^T$ with the topology of uniform convergence, where the metrics are regarded as functions on $T^2$. We prove that the set $\mathcal{A}^{T,1}$ of metrics $d\in\mathcal{M}^T$ for which the Lipschitz-free space $\mathcal{F}(T,d)$ has the metric approximation property is residual in $\mathcal{M}^T$.</description>

      <title>Composition operators between Toeplitz kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we proved that the image of a Toeplitz kernel of dimension $&gt;1$ under composition by an inner function is nearly $S^*$-invariant if and only if the inner function is an automorphism. In this paper, we build on this work and describe the minimal Toeplitz kernel containing the image of a Toeplitz kernel under a composition operator with an inner symbol. Furthermore, this work is extended to the minimal Toeplitz kernel containing the image of a Toeplitz kernel under a weighted composition operator. In particular, the corresponding cases for minimal model spaces are also formulated, generalizing known work on the action of composition operators on model spaces. Finally, the equivalences between Toeplitz kernels are used to formulate the specific maximal vectors for several Toeplitz kernels with symbols expressed in terms of composition operators and inner functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quadrilateral inequality established by C. Sch\"otz in the context of Hilbert spaces is extended to the framework of Banach spaces. Our approach is based on the theory of majorization and a substitute for the parallelogram law associated with Clarkson's notion of von Neumann-Jordan constant. Several examples (concerning matrix theory and geometry of Banach spaces) that illustrate our new results are also included.</description>

      <title>Complete characterization of symmetric Kubo-Ando operator means satisfying Moln\'ar's weak associativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of a subclass of means of positive operators in the class of symmetric Kubo-Ando means that was first introduced and studied in L. Moln\'ar, ``Characterizations of certain means of positive operators," Linear Algebra Appl. 567 (2019) 143-166. In Theorem 6 of that paper, he gives a characterization of this subclass (which we call the Moln\'ar class of means) in terms of the operator monotone functions representing the means, which includes the geometric mean. Furthermore, he leaves open the problem to determine if the geometric mean is the only such mean in that subclass. Here we give an alternative characterization of the Moln\'ar class of means in terms of the boundary-values of bounded harmonic functions on certain rectangles which completely characterizes this class of means. Moreover, we use this to construct an explicit example of a mean in the subclass that is not the geometric means thereby solving the open problem of L. Moln\'ar.</description>

      <title>Analytic Kramer sampling and quasi Lagrange-type interpolation in vector valued RKHS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses an abstract Kramer sampling theorem for functions within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of vector valued holomorphic functions. Additionally, we extend the concept of quasi Lagrange-type interpolation for functions within a RKHS of vector valued entire functions. The dependence of having quasi Lagrange-type interpolation on an invariance condition under the generalized backward shift operator has also been discussed. Furthermore, the paper establishes the connection between quasi Lagrange-type interpolation, operator of multiplication by the independent variable, and de Branges spaces of vector valued entire functions.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation for a Class of Indefinite Elliptic Systems by Comparison Theory for the Spectral Flow via an Index Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider families of strongly indefinite systems of elliptic PDE and investigate bifurcation from a trivial branch of solutions by using the spectral flow. The novelty in our approach is a refined version of a comparison principle that was originally proved by Pejsachowicz in a joint work with the third author, and which is based on an index theorem for a certain class of Fredholm operators that is of independent interest. Finally, we use our findings for a bifurcation problem on shrinking domains that originates from works of Morse and Smale.</description>

      <title>Capacitary inradius and Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a two-sided estimate on the sharp $L^p$ Poincar\'e constant of a general open set, in terms of a capacitary variant of its inradius. This extends a result by Maz'ya and Shubin, originally devised for the case $p=2$, in the subconformal regime. We cover the whole range of $p$, by allowing in particular the extremal cases $p=1$ (Cheeger's constant) and $p=N$ (conformal case), as well. We also discuss the more general case of the sharp Poincar\'e-Sobolev embedding constants and get an analogous result. Finally, we present a brief discussion on the superconformal case, as well as some examples and counter-examples.</description>

      <title>Muckenhoupt Weights Meet Brezis--Seeger--Van Schaftingen--Yung Formulae in Ball Banach Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, via first establishing a weighted variant of the profound and far-reaching inequality obtained by A. Cohen, W. Dahmen, I. Daubechies, and R. DeVore in 2003, the authors give two new characterizations of Muckenhoupt weights. As an application, the authors further establish a representation formula of gradients with sharp parameters in ball Banach function spaces, which extends the famous formula obtained by H. Brezis, A. Seeger, J. Van Schaftingen, and P.-L. Yung in 2021 from classical Sobolev spaces to various different Sobolev-type spaces and gives an affirmative answer to the question in page 29 of [Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 62 (2023), Paper No. 234]. The most novelty of this article exists in subtly revealing the mutual equivalences among the Muckenhoupt weight, the weighted variant of the inequality of Cohen et al., and the weighted upper estimate of the formula of Brezis et al.</description>

      <title>A Proof of $\mathfrak{L}^2$-Boundedness for Magnetic Pseudodifferential Super Operators via Matrix Representations With Respect to Parseval Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental result in pseudodifferential theory is the Calder\'on-Vaillancourt theorem, which states that a pseudodifferential operator defined from a H\"ormander symbol of order $0$ defines a bounded operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. In this work we prove an analog for pseudodifferential \emph{super} operator, \ie operators acting on other operators, in the presence of magnetic fields. More precisely, we show that magnetic pseudodifferential super operators of order $0$ define bounded operators on the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators $\mathfrak{L}^2 \bigl ( \mathcal{B} \bigl ( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \bigr ) \bigr )$. Our proof is inspired by the recent work of Cornean, Helffer and Purice and rests on a characterization of magnetic pseudodifferential super operators in terms of their "matrix element" computed with respect to a Parseval frame.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we give growth estimates for $\|T^n\|$ for $n\to \infty$ in the case $T$ is a strongly Kreiss bounded operator on a UMD Banach space $X$. In several special cases we provide explicit growth rates. This includes known cases such as Hilbert and $L^p$-spaces, but also intermediate UMD spaces such as non-commutative $L^p$-spaces and variable Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>Exact Exponents for Concentration and Isoperimetry in Product Polish Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive variational formulas for the asymptotic exponents (i.e., convergence rates) of the concentration and isoperimetric functions in the product Polish probability space under certain mild assumptions. These formulas are expressed in terms of relative entropies (which are from information theory) and optimal transport cost functionals (which are from optimal transport theory). Hence, our results verify an intimate connection among information theory, optimal transport, and concentration of measure or isoperimetric inequalities. In the concentration regime, the corresponding variational formula is in fact a dimension-free bound in the sense that this bound is valid for any dimension. A cardinality bound for the alphabet of the auxiliary random variable in the expression of the asymptotic isoperimetric exponent is provided, which makes the expression computable by a finite-dimensional program for the finite alphabet case. We lastly apply our results to obtain an isoperimetric inequality in the classic isoperimetric setting, which is asymptotically sharp under certain conditions. The proofs in this paper are based on information-theoretic and optimal transport techniques.</description>

Abstract: We show how the Fourier transform for distributional sections of vector bundles over symmetric spaces of non-compact type $G/K$ can be used for questions of solvability of systems of invariant differential equations in analogy to H\"ormander's proof of the Ehrenpreis-Malgrange theorem. We get complete solvability for the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$ and partial results for products $\mathbb{H}^2 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{H}^2$ and the hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3$.</description>
