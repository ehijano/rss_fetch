      <title>On the degenerate principal series of $G_{2(2)}$ induced from a Heisenberg parabolic subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study degenerate principal series representations of the split real group $G_{2(2)}$ induced from a character of a maximal parabolic subgroup whose unipotent radical is a Heisenberg group. Using the Lie algebra action on the space of $K$-finite vectors, we find the points of reducibility and the complementary series. The minimal representation and a limit of discrete series are identified as kernel of the corresponding Knapp-Stein intertwining operator. Moreover, we show that some quaternionic discrete series representations occur as the subrepresentation on which the family of intertwining operators vanishes of order two.</description>

      <title>The Orbit Method and Character Formulas for Tempered representations of a Nonconnected Reductive Real Algebraic Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a possibly disconnected reductive real Lie group. In this paper, I parametrize the set of irreductible tempered characters of G. I then describe these characters using certain ``Kirillov's formulas,'' based on the descent method near each elliptic element in G. If G is linear and connected, the parameters I use are ``final basic'' parameters in the sense of Knapp and Zuckerman.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some homological properties of the parabolic induction functor for the $p$-adic general linear group. We obtain an embedding theorem of Ext-groups in the context of parabolic induction. As an application, we establish and prove a variation of the non-tempered Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture in homological branching laws for $p$-adic general linear groups.</description>

      <title>Geometric purity and the frame of smashing ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of geometric purity in rigidly-compactly generated tt-categories by considering exact triangles that are pure at each tt-stalk. We develop a systematic study of this concept, including examples and applications. In particular, we show that geometric purity is, in general, strictly stronger than ordinary purity, and that it naturally leads to the notion of geometrically pure-injective objects. We prove that such objects arise as pushforwards of pure-injective objects from suitable tt-stalks. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis of indecomposable geometrically pure-injective objects in the derived category of the projective line. Under mild additional assumptions, we identify the geometric part of the Ziegler spectrum as a closed subset.
  As an application, we demonstrate that this new notion of purity can be used to tackle the problem of spatiality of the frame of smashing ideals via the geometric Ziegler spectrum. In particular, we show that our approach rules out the counterexamples of Balchin and Stevenson to existing methods.</description>

      <title>F-symbols and R-symbols for the Drinfeld center of the Haagerup subfactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have recently devised and implemented an algorithm for computing the Drinfeld center of a fusion category in our software package \textsc{TensorCategories.jl}. By simplifying the field of definition of the F-symbols, R-symbols, and pivotal coefficients of the Haagerup H3 category, we were now able to compute explicit F-symbols, R-symbols, and pivotal coefficients for its Drinfeld center Z(H3). In this paper, we discuss how to access this data. We also present our new general algorithm for finding a gauge of a multiplicity-free fusion category in which the symbols belong to a minimal field.</description>

      <title>Monoidal categorification from alternating snakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the authors introduced the notion of an alternating snake and a corresponding family of finite dimensional modules for the quantum affine algebra associated to $A_n$. We prove that under some restrictions, an alternating snake defines a canonical monoidal category. We prove that this category has finitely many prime objects. As a consequence we prove that the Grothendieck ring is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category $\mathscr C_\xi$ for a suitable height function. In particular it follows that the special family of alternating snakes provides a monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra of type $A_N$ for a suitable value of $N$.</description>

      <title>Dimension statistics of representations of finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses what the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group looks like in some specific cases, including unipotent and reductive groups over finite fields.
  The essence of our investigation is whether the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group can be ``geometerized'', to become equal to the cardinality of certain orbit spaces.
  The first part of this paper deals with nilpotent and reductive groups over finite fields, whereas the second part deals with the symmetric group $S_n$. The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out.</description>

      <title>AIR tilting subcategories of extended hearts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of AIR tilting subcategories of extended hearts of $t$-structures on a triangulated category associated with silting subcategories. This notion generalizes $\tau_{[d]}$-tilting pairs of extended finitely generated modules over finite-dimensional algebras to a more general framework, which includes both extended large modules over unitary rings and truncated subcategories of finite-dimensional derived categories of proper non-positive differential graded algebras. Within this setting, we establish a bijection between AIR tilting subcategories and silting subcategories. Furthermore, we define quasi-tilting and tilting subcategories of extended hearts, extending the corresponding notions from module categories, and investigate their fundamental properties along with the relationships among these tilting-related classes.</description>

      <title>Tropical symmetries of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms of cluster algebras and show that their induced action on the g-vectors can be realized by tropicalising their action on the homogeneous $\hat{y}$ (or $\mathcal{X}$) variables of a chosen initial cluster. This perspective allows us to interpret the action on g-vectors as a change of coordinates in the tropical setting. Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively.
  As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function. Furthermore, we apply our findings to scattering amplitudes in physics, providing a novel interpretation of the square root associated with the four-mass box integral via stable fixed points of quasi-automorphisms of the Grassmannian cluster algebra $\CC[\Gr(4,8)]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.06941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a relative Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for Alexander complexes (also known as Sabbah specialization complexes) by using relative regular holonomic $\mathscr D$-modules in an equivariant way, which particularly gives a "global" approach to the correspondence for Deligne's nearby cycles. Using the correspondence and zero loci of Bernstein-Sato ideals, we obtain a formula for the relative support of the Alexander complexes.</description>

      <title>On the classification of hypergeometric families of orthogonal polynomials on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14715v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several important families of orthogonal polynomials on the real line are called ``hypergeometric'' since they can be explicitly described in terms of some hypergeometric series $_pF_q$ that uses the degree $n$ of the polynomial as a parameter. It is natural to ask if one can classify all such families. Indeed many classification results have been obtained in this direction, but only under the additional assumption that the polynomials are eigenfunctions of some second order operator.
  In this paper we initiate a new approach to this classification. We propose a definition of an HG family that makes precise, but also generalizes, the notion of a ``hypergeometric'' family. Our main result is that there are exactly 10 types of orthogonal HG families, 8 from the well-known Askey scheme and 2 additional types of families that can be expressed in terms of Lommel polynomials.
  Our methods in this paper are algebraic. In particular, we classify a wider class of quasi-orthogonal HG families, and this classification is valid over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. We also define a more general class of rational HG families and prove a structure theorem for quasi-orthogonal families in this class. We provide examples for such families, that are in particular new families of orthogonal polynomials of potential interest.</description>

      <title>Highest weight vectors of tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study highest weight vectors for symmetric and alternating spaces of tensors, whose dimensions are given by generalized Kronecker coefficients. We describe the algebraic relations for classical constructions of corresponding spanning sets of highest weight vectors. The proof is based on important duality that we discover for these highest weight spaces and vectors. As applications of duality, we also give conceptual interpretations to power expansions of Cayley's first hyperdeterminant and its dual exterior form.</description>
