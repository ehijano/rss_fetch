      <title>Discovery of Spin-Crossover Candidates with Equivariant Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swift discovery of spin-crossover materials for their potential application in quantum information devices requires techniques which enable efficient identification of suitably bistable candidates. To this end, we screened the Cambridge Structural Database to develop a specialized database of 1,439 materials and computed spin-switching energies from density functional theory for each material. The database was used to train an equivariant graph convolutional neural network to predict the magnitude of the spin-conversion energy. A test mean absolute error was 360 meV. For candidate identification, we equipped the system with a relevance-based classifier. This approach leads to a nearly four-fold improvement in identifying potential spin-crossover systems of interest as compared to conventional high-throughput screening.</description>

      <title>Statistics of systemwide correlations in the random-field XXZ chain: Importance of rare events in the many-body localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent debates around the many-body localization (MBL) problem, and in particular its stability against systemwide resonances, we investigate long-distance spin-spin correlations across the phase diagram of the random-field XXZ model, with a particular focus on the strong disorder regime. Building on state-of-the-art shift-invert diagonalization techniques, we study the high-energy behavior of transverse and longitudinal correlation functions, computed at the largest possible distance, for a broad range of disorder and interaction strengths. Our results show that while transverse correlations display a fairly stable exponential decay over the entire XXZ phase diagram, longitudinal correlations exhibit markedly different behavior, revealing distinct physical regimes. More precisely, we identify an intermediate disorder region where standard observables show well-converged MBL behavior [J. Colbois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 116502 (2024)] while the distributions of longitudinal correlations reveal unexpected fat-tails towards large values. These rare events strongly influence the average decay of longitudinal correlations, which we find to be algebraic in a broad region inside the supposed MBL phase, whereas the typical decay remains mostly exponential. At stronger disorder and weaker interactions, this intermediate regime is replaced by a more conventional exponential decay with short correlation lengths for both typical and average correlators, as expected for standard localization. Our findings shed light on the systemwide instabilities and raise important questions about the impact of such rare but large long-range correlations on the stability of the MBL phase. Finally, we discuss the possible fate of the intermediate region in the context of recent perspectives in the field.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Spectral Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that noisy quantum dynamics exposed to weak measurements exhibit a spectral transition between gapless and gapped phases. To this end, we employ the Lyapunov spectrum obtained through singular values of a non-unitary matrix describing the dynamics. We discover that the gapless and gapped phases respectively correspond to the volume-law and area-law phases of the entanglement entropy for the dominant Lyapunov vector. This correspondence between the spectral gap and the scaling of entanglement offers an intriguing analogy with ground-state phase transitions. We also discuss some crucial differences from ground-state transitions, such as the scaling law of the entanglement and the exponentially small gaps. Furthermore, we show that the spectral transition leads to the transition of the timescale for the memory loss of initial states.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone &amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson &amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Electron transverse transport enhancement by composite formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive neural quantum states of Fermi Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful ansatz for variational quantum Monte Carlo studies of strongly-correlated systems. Here, we apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and autoregressive transformer neural networks to the Fermi-Hubbard and the (non-Hermitian) Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. In both cases, we observe that the convergence of the RNN ansatz is challenged when increasing the interaction strength. We present a physically-motivated and easy-to-implement strategy for improving the optimization, namely, by ramping of the model parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the autoregressive sampling property of both network architectures. For the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model, we identify convergence issues that stem from the autoregressive sampling scheme in combination with the non-Hermitian nature of the model. Our findings provide insights into the challenges of the NQS approach and make the first step towards exploring strongly-correlated electrons using this ansatz.</description>
