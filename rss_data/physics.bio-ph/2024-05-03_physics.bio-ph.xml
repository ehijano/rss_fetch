      <title>Formation of extraterrestrial peptides and their derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of protein precursors, due to the condensation of atomic carbon under the low-temperature conditions of the molecular phases of the interstellar medium, opens alternative pathways for the origin of life. We perform peptide synthesis under conditions prevailing in space and provide a comprehensive analytic characterization of its products. The application of 13C allowed us to confirm the suggested pathway of peptide formation that proceeds due to the polymerization of aminoketene molecules that are formed in the C + CO + NH3 reaction. Here, we address the question of how the efficiency of peptide production is modified by the presence of water molecules. We demonstrate that although water slightly reduces the efficiency of polymerization of aminoketene, it does not prevent the formation of peptides.</description>

      <title>Scaling of phase count in multicomponent liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixtures with many components can segregate into coexisting phases, e.g., in biological cells and synthetic materials such as metallic glass. The interactions between components dictate what phases form in equilibrium, but quantifying this relationship has proven difficult. We derive scaling relations for the number of coexisting phases in multicomponent liquids with random interactions and compositions, which we verify numerically. Our results indicate that interactions only need to increase logarithmically with the number of components for the liquid to segregate into many phases. In contrast, a stability analysis of the homogeneous state predicts a power-law scaling. This discrepancy implies an enormous parameter regime where the number of coexisting phases exceeds the number of unstable modes, generalizing the nucleation and growth regime of binary mixtures to many components.</description>

      <title>Tibial Strains are Sensitive to Speed, but not Grade, Perturbations During Running</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04139v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fatigue-failure process is hypothesized to govern the development of tibial stress fractures, where bone damage is highly dependent on the peak strain magnitude. To date, much of the work examining tibial strains during running has ignored uphill and downhill running despite the prevalence of this terrain. This study examined the sensitivity of tibial strains to changes in running grade and speed using a combined musculoskeletal-finite element modeling routine. Seventeen participants ran on a treadmill at $\pm$10{\deg}, $\pm$5{\deg}, and 0{\deg}; at each grade, participants ran at 3.33 m/s and a grade-adjusted speed - 2.50 m/s and 4.17 m/s for uphill and downhill conditions, respectively. Force and motion data were recorded in each grade and speed combination. Muscle and joint contact forces were estimated using inverse-dynamics-based static optimization. These forces were applied to a participant-informed finite element model of the tibia. None of the strain variables (50th and 95th percentile strain and strained volume $\geq$4000 $\mu\varepsilon$) differed as a function of running grade; however, all strain variables were sensitive to running speed (F(1)$\geq$9.59, p$\leq$0.03). In particular, a 1 m/s increase in running speed resulted in a 9% ($\approx$ 260 $\mu\varepsilon$) and 155% ($\approx$ 600 mm^3) increase in peak strain and strained volume, respectively. Overall, these findings suggest that faster running speed, but not changes in running grade, may be more deleterious to the tibia.</description>

      <title>Graph topological transformations in space-filling cell aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell rearrangements are fundamental mechanisms driving large-scale deformations of living tissues. In three-dimensional (3D) space-filling cell aggregates, cells rearrange through local topological transitions of the network of cell-cell interfaces, which is most conveniently described by the vertex model. Since these transitions are not yet mathematically properly formulated, the 3D vertex model is generally difficult to implement. The few existing implementations rely on highly customized and complex software-engineering solutions, which cannot be transparently delineated and are thus mostly non-reproducible. To solve this outstanding problem, we propose a reformulation of the vertex model. Our approach, called Graph Vertex Model (GVM), is based on storing the topology of the cell network into a knowledge graph with a particular data structure that allows performing cell-rearrangement events by simple graph transformations. Importantly, when these same transformations are applied to a two-dimensional (2D) polygonal cell aggregate, they reduce to a well-known T1 transition, thereby generalizing cell-rearrangements in 2D and 3D space-filling packings. This result suggests that the GVM's graph data structure may be the most natural representation of cell aggregates and tissues. We also develop a Python package that implements GVM, relying on a graph-database-management framework Neo4j. We use this package to characterize an order-disorder transition in 3D cell aggregates, driven by active noise and we find aggregates undergoing efficient ordering close to the transition point. In all, our work showcases knowledge graphs as particularly suitable data models for structured storage, analysis, and manipulation of tissue data.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched. However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response, including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.</description>
