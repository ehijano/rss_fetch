      <title>Normalizing Flows for Domain Adaptation when Identifying $\Lambda$ Hyperon Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the novel application of a normalizing flow as a method of domain adaptation. Normalizing flows offer a way to transform data points between two different distributions. The present study investigates a method of transforming latent representations of physics data to a normal distribution and then to a physics distribution again. The final distribution models a simulated distribution. Following the transformation process, the data can be classified by a neural network trained on labeled simulation data. The present study succeeds in training two normalizing flows that can transform between data (or simulation) and a Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>Physics-based signal analysis of genome sequences: GenomeBits overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive overview of the recent physics-inspired genome analysis tool, GenomeBits, is presented. This is based on traditional signal processing methods such as Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). GenomeBits can be used to extract underlying genomics features from the distribution of nucleotides, and can be further used to analyze the mutation patterns in viral genomes. Examples of the main GenomeBits findings outlining the intrinsic signal organization of genomics sequences for different SARS-CoV-2 variants along the pandemic years 2020-2022 and Monkeypox cases in 2021 are presented to show the usefulness of GenomeBits. GenomeBits results for DFT of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in different geographical regions are discussed together with the GenomeBits analysis of complete genome sequences for the first coronavirus variants reported: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon and Eta. Interesting features of the Delta and Omicron variants in the form of a unique "order-disorder" transition are uncovered from these samples as well as from their cumulative distribution function and scatter plots. This class of transitions might reveal the cumulative outcome of mutations on the spike protein. A salient feature of GenomeBits is the mapping of the nucleotide bases (A,T,C,G) into an alternating spin-like numerical sequence via a series having binary (0,1) indicators for each A,T,C,G. This leads to derive a set of statistical distribution curves. Furthermore, the quantum-based extension of the GenomeBits model to an analogous probability measure is shown to identify properties of genome sequences as wavefunctions via a superposition of states. An association of the integral of the GenomeBits coding and a binding-like energy can in principle also be established. The relevance of these different results in Bioinformatics is analyzed.</description>

      <title>QubiCSV: An Open-Source Data Storage and Visualization Platform for Collaborative Qubit Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing collaborative research platforms for quantum bit control is crucial for driving innovation in the field, as they enable the exchange of ideas, data, and implementation to achieve more impactful outcomes. Furthermore, considering the high costs associated with quantum experimental setups, collaborative environments are vital for maximizing resource utilization efficiently. However, the lack of dedicated data management platforms presents a significant obstacle to progress, highlighting the necessity for essential assistive tools tailored for this purpose. Current qubit control systems are unable to handle complicated management of extensive calibration data and do not support effectively visualizing intricate quantum experiment outcomes. In this paper, we introduce QubiCSV (Qubit Control Storage and Visualization), a platform specifically designed to meet the demands of quantum computing research, focusing on the storage and analysis of calibration and characterization data in qubit control systems. As an open-source tool, QubiCSV facilitates efficient data management of quantum computing, providing data versioning capabilities for data storage and allowing researchers and programmers to interact with qubits in real time. The insightful visualization are developed to interpret complex quantum experiments and optimize qubit performance. QubiCSV not only streamlines the handling of qubit control system data but also improves the user experience with intuitive visualization features, making it a valuable asset for researchers in the quantum computing domain.</description>
