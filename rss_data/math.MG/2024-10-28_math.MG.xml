      <title>On elliptic and quasiregularly elliptic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his book "Metric structures for Riemannian and non-Riemannian spaces", Gromov defined two properties of Riemannian manifolds, ellipticity and quasiregular ellipticity, and suggested that there may be a connection between the two. Since then, groups of researchers working independently have proved strikingly similar results about these two concepts. We obtain new topological obstructions to the two properties: most notably, we show that closed manifolds of both types must have virtually abelian fundamental group. We also give the first examples of open manifolds which are elliptic but not quasireguarly elliptic and vice versa. Whether there is a direct connection between these properties -- and, in particular, whether they are equivalent for closed manifolds -- remains elusive.</description>

      <title>On combinatorial descriptions of faces of the cone of supermodular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Five different ways of combinatorial description of non-empty faces of the cone of supermodular functions on the power set of a finite basic set $N$ are introduced. Their identification with faces of the cone of supermodular games allows one to associate to them certain polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$, known as cores (of these games) in context of cooperative game theory, or generalized permutohedra in context of polyhedral geometry. Non-empty faces of the supermodular cone then correspond to normal fans of those polytopes. This (basically) geometric way of description of faces of the cone then leads to the combinatorial ways of their description. The first combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain partitions of the set of enumerations of $N$, known as rank tests in context of algebraic statistics. The second combinatorial way is to identify faces with certain collections of posets on $N$, known as (complete) fans of posets in context of polyhedral geometry. The third combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain coverings of the power set of $N$, introduced relatively recently in context of cooperative game theory under name core structures. The fourth combinatorial way is to identify the faces with certain formal conditional independence structures, introduced formerly in context of multivariate statistics under name structural semi-graphoids. The fifth way is to identify the faces with certain subgraphs of the permutohedral graph, whose nodes are enumerations of $N$. We prove the equivalence of those six ways of description of non-empty faces of the supermodular cone. This result also allows one to describe the faces of the polyhedral cone of (rank functions of) polymatroids over $N$ and the faces of the submodular cone over $N$.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of $\alpha \beta$-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Feng-Xiong lower bound of $1/2$ for the box dimension of $\alpha\beta$-sets is tight. We also study how much of an $\alpha\beta$-orbit ``carries the dimension'': deleting an arbitararily small positive density set of times can cause the box dimension to drop to zero, but the Assouad dimension cannot drop below $1/4$.</description>

      <title>New results on embeddings of self-similar sets via renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For self-similar sets $X,Y\subseteq \mathbb{R}$, we obtain new results towards the affine embeddings conjecture of Feng-Huang-Rao (2014), and the equivalent weak intersections conjecture. We show that the conjecture holds when the defining maps of $X,Y$ have algebraic contraction ratios, and also for arbitrary $Y$ when the maps defining $X$ have algebraic-contraction ratios and there are sufficiently many of them relative to the number of maps defining $Y$. We also show that it holds for a.e. choice of the corresponding contraction ratios, and obtain bounds on the packing dimension of the exceptional parameters. Key ingredients in our argument include a new renormalization procedure in the space of embeddings, and Orponen's projection Theorem for Assouad dimension (2021).</description>

      <title>Positive Scalar Curvature Meets Ricci Limit Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of uniformly positive scalar curvature on the size of a non-collapsed Ricci limit space coming from a sequence of $n$-manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and uniformly positive scalar curvature. We prove that such a limit space splits at most $n-2$ lines or $\mathbb{R}$-factors. When this maximal splitting occurs, we obtain a uniform upper bound on the diameter of the non-splitting factor. Moreover, we obtain a volume gap estimate and a volume growth order estimate of geodesic balls on such manifolds.</description>

      <title>Ergodic maps and the cohomology of nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how the cohomology of nilpotent groups is affected by Lipschitz maps. We show that, given a smooth Lipschitz map $f$ between two simply-connected nilpotent Lie groups $G$ and $H$, there is a map $\psi$ that induces an ergodic measure on the space of functions from $G$ to $H$. We call such maps ergodic maps. We show that when $\psi$ is an ergodic map, the pullback $\psi^*\omega$ of a differential form $\omega$ admits a well-defined amenable average $\overline{\psi^{*}}\omega$, and $\overline{\psi^*}$ is a homomorphism of cohomology algebras. In the case that $f$ is a quasi-isometry, the ergodic map $\psi$ is also a quasi-isometry, and $\overline{\psi^*}$ is an isomorphism. This lets us generalize and provide a simplified, self-contained proof of the theorem due to Shalom, Sauer, and Gotfredsen-Kyed that quasi-isometric nilpotent groups have isomorphic cohomology algebras.</description>
