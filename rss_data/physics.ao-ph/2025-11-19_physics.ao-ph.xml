      <title>Reconstructing the Aerosol State from Partial Observations with Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key aerosol properties that shape climate -- such as CCN activity, scattering and absorption, and ice nucleation efficiency -- are difficult to infer from measurements that typically capture only a part of the aerosol state. We develop a conditional generative framework that maps a label (a vector of partial observations) to an ensemble of plausible aerosol states and propagates these to diagnostics, yielding mean estimates with confidence intervals. Using synthetic data, we evaluate two label configurations: a low-dimensional setup with limited number distribution and bulk-composition information, and a high-dimensional setup including complete number and total mass distributions plus species bulk masses. Generated samples maintain strong label compliance, and higher-dimensional labels markedly reduce variability. CCN activity and volume scattering are well constrained even under the low-dimensional setup, whereas dust- and BC-sensitive diagnostics (frozen fraction, absorption) benefit substantially from the additional information in the high-dimensional case. This framework clarifies which observational inputs most effectively constrain different diagnostics and demonstrates how generative machine learning can provide uncertainty-aware estimates from incomplete aerosol information.</description>

      <title>Taylors hypothesis and its impact on flux measurements in a forest clearcut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taylors hypothesis is the backbone to convert observations done over time to spatial information of the flow while carrying out turbulence measurements on a micrometeorological tower. To address its validity over a highly heterogeneous forest clearcut surface, we utilize an extensive Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Eddy Covariance (EC) datasets. The DTS measured space-time correlation curves of temperature fluctuations are used to compute the bulk convective speeds of temperature structures in buoyant conditions at a height of 3.1 m above the clearing. These convective speeds are compared with the mean wind speed and turbulent intensities of streamwise velocities obtained from the EC system at the middle of the clearcut. Depending on if is parallel or perpendicular to the forest edge, the relationships between and are significantly different. However, irrespective of the wind direction, the convective speeds of temperature structures at inertial subrange scales behave in a power-law fashion with increasing wavenumbers. The exponent of this power-law differs from a homogeneous atmospheric surface layer flow, thereby pointing towards the effects of heterogeneity. The scale-dependent convective speeds non-linearly transform the temporal frequencies to streamwise wavenumbers, which, eventually, impacts the properties of turbulence (co) spectra. More importantly, this non-linear transformation yields a critical frequency limit, beyond which the eddy length scales derived from frequencies are smaller than the physical dimension of the sonic anemometers, and therefore, cannot be faithfully resolved. This critical limit questions the EC flux estimates beyond this frequency.</description>

      <title>Appa: Bending Weather Dynamics with Latent Diffusion Models for Global Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has advanced weather forecasting, but accurate predictions first require identifying the current state of the atmosphere from observational data. In this work, we introduce Appa, a score-based data assimilation model generating global atmospheric trajectories at 0.25\si{\degree} resolution and 1-hour intervals. Powered by a 565M-parameter latent diffusion model trained on ERA5, Appa can be conditioned on arbitrary observations to infer plausible trajectories, without retraining. Our probabilistic framework handles reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting, within a single model, producing physically consistent reconstructions from various inputs. Results establish latent score-based data assimilation as a promising foundation for future global atmospheric modeling systems.</description>
