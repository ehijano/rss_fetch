      <title>European coastal wetlands datasets and their use in decision-support tools for policy restoration objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecosystem restoration is a paramount policy priority for this decade, with ambitious global and European targets requiring unprecedented levels of data-driven implementation. Achieving effective and equitable restoration, particularly for coastal wetlands, hinges on spatially explicit socio-ecological information maps that integrate habitats, ecosystem services, human activities, and pressures to guide prioritization, stakeholder negotiation, and adaptive management. This study introduces an innovative multi-layered dataset that bridges science and policy for six emblematic European coastal wetlands. The dataset consolidates ecological mapping (EUNIS 2021 and 2022) human activity and pressure documentation (aligned with EU Habitats Directive, Water Framework Directive, and Marine Strategy Framework Directive) comprehensive ecosystem services mapping (CICES) alongside robust participatory community and stakeholder data. By illustrating practical pathways for participatory engagement, trade-off negotiation, and cross-scale integration, this research equips scientists, policymakers, practitioners, and communities with the scientific foundation to propel the Nature Restoration Regulation and Biodiversity Strategy 2030 objectives, fortifying Europe climate adaptation trajectory. The approach showcased signals a new era for restoration science, where spatially explicit, multi-actor data supports policy, mobilizes citizen stewardship, and accelerates the transformative ambitions of Europe restoration decade.</description>

      <title>Verification of the Outer Space Treaty with Cosmic Protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Outer Space Treaty (OST) was opened to signatures in 1967, and since then 117 countries, including China, the United States, Russia, have become part of it. Among other stipulations the treaty bans the placement of nuclear weapons in outer space. Recently the US government has raised worries that Russia is testing nuclear-armed anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) components, with the possibility that it will place a nuclear weapon in space. Such a device, if detonated, would destroy most of the satellites in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This danger is compounded by the lack of a verification mechanism for the OST. No methodologies of verification have been proposed in the open peer reviewed literature. This study presents a concept and a feasibility study for verifying a satellite's compliance to the OST by observing the neutrons induced by spallation from the $\sim$GeV protons in the inner Van Allen radiation belts. The calculations show that a 9U CubeSat sized detection platform can identify a thermonuclear weapon from the distance of 4 km in approximately one week of observation. This conceptual study will stimulate and inform future research and development of verification platforms for OST.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for Misinformation Propagation in Complex Networks: Topology-Dependent Distortion and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misinformation is pervasive in natural, biological, social, and engineered systems, yet its quantitative characterization remains challenging. We develop a general mathematical framework for quantifying information distortion in distributed systems by modeling how local transmission errors accumulate along network geodesics and reshape each agent's perceived global state. Through a drift-fluctuation decomposition of pathwise binomial noise, we derive closed-form expressions for node-level perception distributions and show that directional bias induces only a uniform shift in the mean, preserving the fluctuation structure. Applying the framework to canonical graph ensembles, we uncover strong topological signatures of misinformation: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs exhibit a double-peaked distortion profile driven by connectivity transitions and geodesic-length fluctuations, scale-free networks suppress misinformation through hub-mediated integration, and optimally rewired small-world networks achieve comparable suppression by balancing clustering with short paths. A direct comparison across regular lattices, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, Watts-Strogatz small-world networks, and Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks reveals a connectivity-dependent crossover. In the extremely sparse regime, scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks behave similarly. At intermediate sparsity, Watts-Strogatz small-world networks exhibit the lowest misinformation. In contrast, Barab\'as-Albert scale-free networks maintain low misinformation in sparse and dense regimes, while regular lattices produce the highest distortion across connectivities. We additionally show how sparsity constraints, structural organization, and connection costs delineate regimes of minimal misinformation.</description>
