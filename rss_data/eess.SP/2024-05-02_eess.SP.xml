      <title>Indoor Synthetic Aperture Radar Measurements of Point-Like Targets Using a Wheeled Mobile Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small, low-cost radar sensors offer a lighting independent sensing capability for indoor mobile robots that is useful for localization and mapping. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers an attractive way to increase the angular resolution of small radar sensors for use on mobile robots to generate high-resolution maps of the indoor environment. This work quantifies the maximum synthesizable aperture length of our mobile robot measurement setup using radar-inertial odometry localization and offers insights into challenges for robotic millimeter-wave SAR imaging.</description>

      <title>Heart Rate and Body Temperature Relationship in Children Admitted to PICU -- A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vital signs have been essential clinical measures. Among these, body temperature (BT) and heart rate (HR) are particularly significant, and numerous studies explored their association in hospitalized adults and children. However, a lack of in-depth research persists in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) despite their critical condition requiring particular attention. Objective: In this study, we explore the relationship between HR and BT in children from 0 to 18 years old admitted to the PICU of CHU Sainte-Justine Hospital. Methods: We applied Machine learning (ML) techniques to unravel subtle patterns and dependencies within our dataset to achieve this objective. Each algorithm undergoes meticulous hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model performance. Results: Our findings align with prior research, revealing a consistent trend of decreasing HR with increasing patient age, confirming the observed inverse correlation. Furthermore, a thorough analysis identifies Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) implemented with Quantile regression (QR), as the most fitting model, effectively capturing the non-linear relationship between HR, BT, and age. Through testing the HR prediction model based on age and BT, the predictive model between the 5th and 95th percentiles accurately demonstrates the declining trend of HR with age, while HR increase with BT. Based on that, we have developed a user-friendly interface tailored to generate HR predictions at different percentiles based on three key input parameters : current HR, current BT, and patient's age. The resulting output enables caregivers to quickly determine whether a patient's HR falls within or outside the normal range, facilitating informed clinical decision-making. Thus, our results challenge previous studies' presumed direct linear association between HR and BT.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Learning-based Joint CSI Prediction and Predictive Transmitter Selection for Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mobile communication scenarios, the acquired channel state information (CSI) rapidly becomes outdated due to fast-changing channels. Opportunistic transmitter selection based on current CSI for secrecy improvement may be outdated during actual transmission, negating the diversity benefit of transmitter selection. Motivated by this problem, we propose a joint CSI prediction and predictive selection of the optimal transmitter strategy based on historical CSI by exploiting the temporal correlation among CSIs. The proposed solution utilizes the multi-task learning (MTL) framework by employing a single Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network architecture that simultaneously learns two tasks of predicting the CSI and selecting the optimal transmitter in parallel instead of learning these tasks sequentially. The proposed LSTM architecture outperforms convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture due to its superior ability to capture temporal features in the data. Compared to the sequential task learning models, the MTL architecture provides superior predicted secrecy performance for a large variation in the number of transmitters and the speed of mobile nodes. It also offers significant computational and memory efficiency, leading to a substantial saving in computational time by around 40 percent.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Positioning with Continuous Delay and Doppler Shift using AFT-MC Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel integrated localization and communication (ILAC) system using the affine Fourier transform multicarrier (AFT-MC) waveform. Specifically, we consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) AFT-MC system with ILAC and derive a continuous delay and Doppler shift channel matrix model. Based on the derived signal model, we develop a two-step algorithm with low complexity for estimating channel parameters. Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of location estimation as the fundamental limit of localization. Finally, we provide some insights about the AFT-MC parameters by explaining the impact of the parameters on localization performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the AFT-MC waveform is able to provide significant localization performance improvement compared to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) while achieving the CRLB of location estimation.</description>

      <title>Compressive Sensing Imaging Using Caustic Lens Mask Generated by Periodic Perturbation in a Ripple Tank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz imaging shows significant potential across diverse fields, yet the cost-effectiveness of multi-pixel imaging equipment remains an obstacle for many researchers. To tackle this issue, the utilization of single-pixel imaging arises as a lower-cost option, however, the data collection process necessary for reconstructing images is time-consuming. Compressive Sensing offers a promising solution by enabling image generation with fewer measurements than required by Nyquist's theorem, yet long processing times remain an issue, especially for large-sized images. Our proposed solution to this issue involves using caustic lens effect induced by perturbations in a ripple tank as a sampling mask. The dynamic characteristics of the ripple tank introduce randomness into the sampling process, thereby reducing measurement time through exploitation of the inherent sparsity of THz band signals. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network was used to conduct target classification, based on the distinctive signal patterns obtained via the caustic lens mask. The suggested classifier obtained a 95.16 % accuracy rate in differentiating targets resembling Latin letters.</description>

      <title>A Modular Pragmatic Architecture for Multiuser MIMO with Array-Fed RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a power- and hardware-efficient, pragmatic, modular, multiuser/multibeam array-fed RIS architecture particularly suited to operate in very high frequency bands (high mmWave and sub-THz), where channels are typically sparse in the beamspace and line-of-sight (LOS) is required to achieve an acceptable received signal level. The key module is an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) with a small number of active antennas placed in the near field of a RIS with a much larger number of passive controllable reflecting elements. We propose a pragmatic approach to obtain a steerable beam with high gain and very low sidelobes. Then, $K$ independently controlled beams can be achieved by stacking $K$ of such AMAF-RIS modules. Our analysis takes in full account: 1) the near-end crosstalk (NEXT) between the modules, 2) the far-end crosstalk (FEXT) due to the sidelobes; 3) a thorough energy efficiency comparison with respect to conventional {\em active arrays} with the same beamforming performance. Overall, we show that the proposed architecture is very attractive in terms of spectral efficiency, ease of implementation (hardware complexity), and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-noise pulse-compression thermography: a powerful tool for time-domain thermography analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse-compression is a correlation-based measurement technique successfully used in many NDE applications to increase the SNR in the presence of huge noise, strong signal attenuation or when high excitation levels must be avoided. In thermography, the pulse-compression approach was firstly introduced in 2005 by Mulavesaala and co-workers, and then further developed by Mandelis and co-authors that applied to thermography the concept of the thermal-wave radar developed for photothermal measurements. Since then, many measurement schemes and applications have been reported in the literature by several groups by using various heating sources, coded excitation signals, and processing algorithms. The variety of such techniques is known as pulse-compression thermography or thermal-wave radar imaging. Even despite the continuous improvement of these techniques during these years, the advantages of using a correlation-based approach in thermography are still not fully exploited and recognized by the community. This is because up to now the reconstructed thermograms' time sequences after pulse-compression were affected by the so-called sidelobes. This is a severe drawback since it hampers an easy interpretation of the data and their comparison with other thermography techniques. To overcome this issue and unleash the full potential of the approach, this paper shows how it is possible to implement a pulse-compression thermography procedure capable of suppressing any sidelobe by using a pseudo-noise excitation and a proper processing algorithm.</description>

      <title>BrainODE: Dynamic Brain Signal Analysis via Graph-Aided Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain network analysis is vital for understanding the neural interactions regarding brain structures and functions, and identifying potential biomarkers for clinical phenotypes. However, widely used brain signals such as Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) time series generated from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) often manifest three challenges: (1) missing values, (2) irregular samples, and (3) sampling misalignment, due to instrumental limitations, impacting downstream brain network analysis and clinical outcome predictions. In this work, we propose a novel model called BrainODE to achieve continuous modeling of dynamic brain signals using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). By learning latent initial values and neural ODE functions from irregular time series, BrainODE effectively reconstructs brain signals at any time point, mitigating the aforementioned three data challenges of brain signals altogether. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world neuroimaging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BrainODE and its capability of addressing the three data challenges.</description>

      <title>Improving Channel Resilience for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications: A Unified Information Bottleneck Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communications (TSC) enhance radio resource efficiency by transmitting task-relevant semantic information. However, current research often overlooks the inherent semantic distinctions among encoded features. Due to unavoidable channel variations from time and frequency-selective fading, semantically sensitive feature units could be more susceptible to erroneous inference if corrupted by dynamic channels. Therefore, this letter introduces a unified channel-resilient TSC framework via information bottleneck. This framework complements existing TSC approaches by controlling information flow to capture fine-grained feature-level semantic robustness. Experiments on a case study for real-time subchannel allocation validate the framework's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Block-As-Domain Adaptation for Workload Prediction from fNIRS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-intrusive way to measure cortical hemodynamic activity. Predicting cognitive workload from fNIRS data has taken on a diffuse set of methods. To be applicable in real-world settings, models are needed, which can perform well across different sessions as well as different subjects. However, most existing works assume that training and testing data come from the same subjects and/or cannot generalize well across never-before-seen subjects. Additional challenges imposed by fNIRS data include the high variations in inter-subject fNIRS data and also in intra-subject data collected across different blocks of sessions. To address these issues, we propose an effective method, referred to as the class-aware-block-aware domain adaptation (CABA-DA) which explicitly minimize intra-session variance by viewing different blocks from the same subject same session as different domains. We minimize the intra-class domain discrepancy and maximize the inter-class domain discrepancy accordingly. In addition, we propose an MLPMixer-based model for cognitive load classification. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed model has better performance compared with three different baseline models on three public-available datasets of cognitive workload. Two of them are collected from n-back tasks and one of them is from finger tapping. From our experiments, we also show the proposed contrastive learning method can also improve baseline models we compared with.</description>

      <title>SemantiCodec: An Ultra Low Bitrate Semantic Audio Codec for General Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the application of language modelling techniques to audio data. However, traditional codecs often operate at high bitrates or within narrow domains such as speech and lack the semantic clues required for efficient language modelling. Addressing these challenges, we introduce SemantiCodec, a novel codec designed to compress audio into fewer than a hundred tokens per second across diverse audio types, including speech, general audio, and music, without compromising quality. SemantiCodec features a dual-encoder architecture: a semantic encoder using a self-supervised AudioMAE, discretized using k-means clustering on extensive audio data, and an acoustic encoder to capture the remaining details. The semantic and acoustic encoder outputs are used to reconstruct audio via a diffusion-model-based decoder. SemantiCodec is presented in three variants with token rates of 25, 50, and 100 per second, supporting a range of ultra-low bit rates between 0.31 kbps and 1.43 kbps. Experimental results demonstrate that SemantiCodec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Descript codec on reconstruction quality. Our results also suggest that SemantiCodec contains significantly richer semantic information than all evaluated audio codecs, even at significantly lower bitrates. Our code and demos are available at https://haoheliu.github.io/SemantiCodec/.</description>

      <title>Robust Continuous-Time Beam Tracking with Liquid Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is increasingly recognized as a pivotal technology of the sixth-generation communication networks due to the large amounts of available spectrum at high frequencies. However, the huge overhead associated with beam training imposes a significant challenge in mmWave communications, particularly in urban environments with high background noise. To reduce this high overhead, we propose a novel solution for robust continuous-time beam tracking with liquid neural network, which dynamically adjust the narrow mmWave beams to ensure real-time beam alignment with mobile users. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art deep-learning-based approaches. Specifically, our scheme achieves at most 46.9% higher normalized spectral efficiency than the baselines when the user is moving at 5 m/s, demonstrating the potential of liquid neural networks to enhance mmWave mobile communication performance.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Inferring by Conditional WGAN-GP for Holographic Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The beamforming technology with large holographic antenna arrays is one of the key enablers for the next generation of wireless systems, which can significantly improve the spectral efficiency. However, the deployment of large antenna arrays implies high algorithm complexity and resource overhead at both receiver and transmitter ends. To address this issue, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence have been developed to reduce beamforming overhead. Intuitively, if we can implement the near-optimal beamforming only using a tiny subset of the all channel information, the overhead for channel estimation and beamforming would be reduced significantly compared with the traditional beamforming methods that usually need full channel information and the inversion of large dimensional matrix. In light of this idea, we propose a novel scheme that utilizes Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty to infer the full beamforming matrices based on very little of channel information. Simulation results confirm that it can accomplish comparable performance with the weighted minimum mean-square error algorithm, while reducing the overhead by over 50%.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of RIS in the Context of PLA in Wireless Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Re-configurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology has proven itself a promising candidate for the next generation of wireless networks through its enhanced performance in terms of throughput, spectral, and energy efficiency. However, the broadcast nature of RIS-assisted wireless communication makes it vulnerable to malicious attacks at the physical layer. On the other hand, physical layer authentication is an emerging area in the security domain to thwart different attacks such as cloning, spoofing, and impersonation by using the random features of the physical layer. In this paper, we investigate RIS-assisted wireless communication systems to unlock the potential of using RIS for physical layer authentication (PLA). Specifically, we exploit two distinct features of the physical layer: pathloss and channel impulse response (CIR) for PLA in RIS-assisted wireless communication. We construct hypothesis tests for the estimated features and derive the closed-form errors' expressions. Further, we chose the critical error, i.e., missed detection as our objective function for minimization by optimizing the phase shift of the RIS pannel. We compare the performance of our proposed mechanisms with baseline mechanisms which are PLA schemes using the same features but with no RIS assistance. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate our proposed schemes using performance metrics such as the probability of false alarm (PFA), the probability of missed detection (PMD), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results demonstrate the significant positive impact of RIS on PLA, as it effectively reduces PMD values to zero when determining the optimal phase shift.</description>

      <title>Discovering robust biomarkers of neurological disorders from functional MRI using graph neural networks: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a popular tool for modelling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques have been applied on fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with a particular emphasis on the robustness of biomarkers produced for neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies vary greatly across studies on the same disorder and little has been done to evaluate their robustness. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on improving the robustness of potential biomarkers discovered via GNNs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Profitability in Timely Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a communication system where a group of users, interconnected in a bidirectional gossip network, wishes to follow a time-varying source, e.g., updates on an event, in real-time. The users wish to maintain their expected version ages below a threshold, and can either rely on gossip from their neighbors or directly subscribe to a server publishing about the event, if the former option does not meet the timeliness requirements. The server wishes to maximize its profit by increasing subscriptions from users and minimizing event sampling frequency to reduce costs. This leads to a Stackelberg game between the server and the users where the sender is the leader deciding its sampling frequency and the users are the followers deciding their subscription strategies. We investigate equilibrium strategies for low-connectivity and high-connectivity topologies.</description>

      <title>Perceptive, Resilient, and Efficient Networks assisted by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>

Abstract: Wireless communications are nowadays shifting to higher operation frequencies with the aim to meet the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth. While reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are usually envisioned to restore the line-of-sight of blocked links and to efficiently counteract the increased pathloss, their functionalities can extend far beyond these basic operations. Owing to their large surface and the multitude of scatterers, RISs can be exploited to perform advanced wavefront engineering, essentially transforming the incident beam into a non-trivial reflected beam that is able to address the challenges of high frequencies more efficiently than conventional beam-forming. In this paper it is demonstrated how advanced wavefront engineering with RISs enables beam profiles that are able to focus, bend and self-heal, thus offering functionalities beyond the current state-of-the-art. Their potential as enablers of perceptive, resilient, and efficient networks is discussed, and a localization technique based on a hybrid beam-forming/beam-focusing scheme is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>TITAN: Bringing The Deep Image Prior to Implicit Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interpolation capabilities of implicit neural representations (INRs) of images. In principle, INRs promise a number of advantages, such as continuous derivatives and arbitrary sampling, being freed from the restrictions of a raster grid. However, empirically, INRs have been observed to poorly interpolate between the pixels of the fit image; in other words, they do not inherently possess a suitable prior for natural images. In this paper, we propose to address and improve INRs' interpolation capabilities by explicitly integrating image prior information into the INR architecture via deep decoder, a specific implementation of the deep image prior (DIP). Our method, which we call TITAN, leverages a residual connection from the input which enables integrating the principles of the grid-based DIP into the grid-free INR. Through super-resolution and computed tomography experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves upon classic INRs, thanks to the induced natural image bias. We also find that by constraining the weights to be sparse, image quality and sharpness are enhanced, increasing the Lipschitz constant.</description>

      <title>Inverse Unscented Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advances in designing cognitive and counter-adversarial systems have motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this setting, a cognitive 'adversary' tracks its target of interest via a stochastic framework such as a Kalman filter (KF). The target or 'defender' then employs another inverse stochastic filter to infer the forward filter estimates of the defender computed by the adversary. For linear systems, the inverse Kalman filter (I-KF) has been recently shown to be effective in these counter-adversarial applications. In the paper, contrary to prior works, we focus on non-linear system dynamics and formulate the inverse unscented KF (I-UKF) to estimate the defender's state based on the unscented transform, or equivalently, statistical linearization technique. We then generalize this framework to unknown systems by proposing reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based UKF (RKHS-UKF) to learn the system dynamics and estimate the state based on its observations. Our theoretical analyses to guarantee the stochastic stability of I-UKF and RKHS-UKF in the mean-squared sense show that, provided the forward filters are stable, the inverse filters are also stable under mild system-level conditions. We show that, despite being a suboptimal filter, our proposed I-UKF is a conservative estimator, i.e., I-UKF's estimated error covariance upper-bounds its true value. Our numerical experiments for several different applications demonstrate the estimation performance of the proposed filters using recursive Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI).</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Design of Multi-Dimensional Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because of their excellent asymptotic and finite-length performance, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check codes that is gaining increasing attention. Multi-dimensional (MD) SC codes are constructed by connecting copies of an SC code via relocations in order to mitigate various sources of non-uniformity and improve performance in many data storage and data transmission systems. As the number of degrees of freedom in the MD-SC code design increases, appropriately exploiting them becomes more difficult because of the complexity growth of the design process. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for the MD-SC code design, which is based on the gradient-descent (GD) algorithm, to design better MD codes and address this challenge. In particular, we express the expected number of short cycles, which we seek to minimize, in the graph representation of the code in terms of entries of a probability-distribution matrix that characterizes the MD-SC code design. We then find a locally-optimal probability distribution, which serves as the starting point of a finite-length algorithmic optimizer that produces the final MD-SC code. We offer the theoretical analysis as well as the algorithms, and we present experimental results demonstrating that our MD codes, conveniently called GD-MD codes, have notably lower short cycle numbers compared with the available state-of-the-art. Moreover, our algorithms converge on solutions in few iterations, which confirms the complexity reduction as a result of limiting the search space via the locally-optimal GD-MD distributions.</description>
