      <title>Deep Learning-based Epicenter Localization using Single-Station Strong Motion Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of deep learning (DL) techniques to strong motion records for single-station epicenter localization. Often underutilized in seismology-related studies, strong motion records offer a potential wealth of information about seismic events. We investigate whether DL-based methods can effectively leverage this data for accurate epicenter localization. Our study introduces AFAD-1218, a collection comprising more than 36,000 strong motion records sourced from Turkey. To utilize the strong motion records represented in either the time or the frequency domain, we propose two neural network architectures: deep residual network and temporal convolutional networks. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the efficacy of DL approaches in extracting meaningful insights from these records, showcasing their potential for enhancing seismic event analysis and localization accuracy. Notably, our findings highlight significant reductions in prediction error achieved through the exclusion of low signal-to-noise ratio records, both in nationwide experiments and regional transfer-learning scenarios. Overall, this research underscores the promise of DL techniques in harnessing strong motion records for improved seismic event characterization and localization.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Localization with RIS via Two-Dimensional Signal Path Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two-dimensional signal path classification (2D-SPC) for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted near-field (NF) localization. In the NF regime, multiple RIS-driven signal paths (SPs) can contribute to precise localization if these are decomposable and the reflected locations on the RIS are known, referred to as SP decomposition (SPD) and SP labeling (SPL), respectively. To this end, each RIS element modulates the incoming SP's phase by shifting it by one of the values in the phase shift profile (PSP) lists satisfying resolution requirements. By interworking with a conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, the user equipment can construct a 2D spectrum map that couples each SPs time of arrival (ToA) and PSP. Then, we design SPL by mapping SPs with the corresponding reflected RIS elements when they share the same PSP. Given two unlabeled SPs, we derive a geometric discriminant from checking whether the current label is correct. It can be extended to more than three SPs by sorting them using pairwise geometric discriminants between adjacent ones. From simulation results, it has been demonstrated that the proposed 2D SPC achieves consistent localization accuracy even if insufficient PSPs are given.</description>

      <title>VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved flexibility and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the calculation of the contrast variation into each of the subnetworks, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, which guarantees the physical interpretability of variables of the subnetworks. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</description>

      <title>Synchronization Scheme based on Pilot Sharing in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the impact of pilot-sharing scheme on synchronization performance in a scenario where several slave access points (APs) with uncertain carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) and timing offsets (TOs) share a common pilot sequence. First, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) with pilot contamination is derived for pilot-pairing estimation. Furthermore, a maximum likelihood algorithm is presented to estimate the CFO and TO among the pairing APs. Then, to minimize the sum of CRBs, we devise a synchronization strategy based on a pilot-sharing scheme by jointly optimizing the cluster classification, synchronization overhead, and pilot-sharing scheme, while simultaneously considering the overhead and each AP's synchronization requirements. To solve this NP-hard problem, we simplify it into two sub-problems, namely cluster classification problem and the pilot sharing problem. To strike a balance between synchronization performance and overhead, we first classify the clusters by using the K-means algorithm, and propose a criteria to find a good set of master APs. Then, the pilot-sharing scheme is obtained by using the swap-matching operations. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our derivations and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme over the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Layered Chirp Spread Spectrum Modulations for LPWANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines two chirp spread spectrum techniques specifically devised for low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) to optimize energy and spectral efficiency (SE). These methods referred to as layered CSS (LCSS) and layered dual-mode CSS (LDMCSS), involves utilizing multiple layers for multiplexing symbols with varying chirp rates. These waveform designs exemplify a high degree of SE compared to existing schemes. Additionally, LDMCSS necessitates a lesser number of layers than LCSS to attain comparable SE, thereby reducing computational complexity. These proposed techniques can employ coherent and non-coherent detection and can be adjusted to achieve various spectral efficiencies by altering the number of multiplexed layers. Unlike our proposed LCSS and LDMCSS, other CSS alternatives for LPWANs cannot provide the same level of flexibility and SE. The performance of these techniques is evaluated in terms of bit error rate under different channel conditions, as well as with phase and frequency offsets.</description>

      <title>High-SNR Comparison of Linear Precoding and DPC in RIS-Aided MIMO Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare dirty paper coding (DPC) and linear precoding methods in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)- aided high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenario, where the channel between the base station (BS) and the RIS is dominated by a line-of-sight (LOS) component. Furthermore, we consider two groups of users where one group can be efficiently served by the BS, whereas the other one has a negligible direct channel and has to be served via the RIS. These considerations allow us to analytically show fundamental differences between DPC and linear methods. In particular, our analysis addresses two essential aspects, i.e., the orthogonality of the BS-RIS channel with the direct channel and an interference term that is present only for linear precoding techniques. The interference term leads to strong limitations for the linear method, especially for random or statistical phase shifts. Moreover, we discuss under which circumstances this interference term is negligible and in which scenarios DPC and linear precoding lead to the same performance.</description>

      <title>A Digital Beamforming Receiver Architecture Implemented on a FPGA for Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning interest within the space community in digital beamforming is largely attributable to the superior flexibility that satellites with active antenna systems offer for a wide range of applications, notably in communication services. This paper delves into the analysis and practical implementation of a Digital Beamforming and Digital Down Conversion (DDC) chain, leveraging a high-speed Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) certified for space applications alongside a high-performance Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The proposed design strategy focuses on optimizing resource efficiency and minimizing power consumption by strategically sequencing the beamformer processor ahead of the complex down-conversion operation. This innovative approach entails the application of demodulation and low-pass filtering exclusively to the aggregated beam channel, culminating in a marked reduction in the requisite digital signal processing resources relative to traditional, more resource-intensive digital beamforming and DDC architectures. In the experimental validation, an evaluation board integrating a high-speed ADC and a FPGA was utilized. This setup facilitated the empirical validation of the design's efficacy by applying various RF input signals to the digital beamforming receiver system. The ADC employed is capable of high-resolution signal processing, while the FPGA provides the necessary computational flexibility and speed for real-time digital signal processing tasks. The findings underscore the potential of this design to significantly enhance the efficiency and performance of digital beamforming systems in space applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Multi-Step Spectrum Prediction Using Transformer and Stacked Bi-LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum prediction is considered as a key technology to assist spectrum decision. Despite the great efforts that have been put on the construction of spectrum prediction, achieving accurate spectrum prediction emphasizes the need for more advanced solutions. In this paper, we propose a new multichannel multi-step spectrum prediction method using Transformer and stacked bidirectional LSTM (Bi- LSTM), named TSB. Specifically, we use multi-head attention and stacked Bi-LSTM to build a new Transformer based on encoder-decoder architecture. The self-attention mechanism composed of multiple layers of multi-head attention can continuously attend to all positions of the multichannel spectrum sequences. The stacked Bi-LSTM can learn these focused coding features by multi-head attention layer by layer. The advantage of this fusion mode is that it can deeply capture the long-term dependence of multichannel spectrum data. We have conducted extensive experiments on a dataset generated by a real simulation platform. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the baselines.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Domain Pulse Design for OTFS-NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of developing an orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS)-based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system where each user is modulated using orthogonal pulses in the delay Doppler domain. Building upon the concept of the sufficient (bi)orthogonality train-pulse [1], we extend this idea by introducing Hermite functions, known for their orthogonality properties. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed Hermite functions outperform the traditional OTFS-NOMA schemes, including power-domain (PDM) NOMA and code-domain (CDM) NOMA, in terms of bit error rate (BER) over a high-mobility channel. The algorithm's complexity is minimal, primarily involving the demodulation of OTFS. The spectrum efficiency of Hermite-based OTFS-NOMA is K times that of OTFS-CDM-NOMA scheme, where K is the spreading length of the NOMA waveform.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Representation for Numbers in Clinical Narratives Using CamemBERT-bio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research aims to classify numerical values extracted from medical documents across seven distinct physiological categories, employing CamemBERT-bio. Previous studies suggested that transformer-based models might not perform as well as traditional NLP models in such tasks. To enhance CamemBERT-bio's performances, we introduce two main innovations: integrating keyword embeddings into the model and adopting a number-agnostic strategy by excluding all numerical data from the text. The implementation of label embedding techniques refines the attention mechanisms, while the technique of using a `numerical-blind' dataset aims to bolster context-centric learning. Another key component of our research is determining the criticality of extracted numerical data. To achieve this, we utilized a simple approach that involves verifying if the value falls within the established standard ranges. Our findings are encouraging, showing substantial improvements in the effectiveness of CamemBERT-bio, surpassing conventional methods with an F1 score of 0.89. This represents an over 20\% increase over the 0.73 $F_1$ score of traditional approaches and an over 9\% increase over the 0.82 $F_1$ score of state-of-the-art approaches. All this was achieved despite using small and imbalanced training datasets.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Downlink NOMA Systems: Power Allocation and Antenna Position Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel communication paradigm employing movable antennas (MAs) within a multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink framework, where users are equipped with MAs. Initially, leveraging the far-field response, we delineate the channel characteristics concerning both the power allocation coefficient and positions of MAs. Subsequently, we endeavor to maximize the channel capacity by jointly optimizing power allocation and antenna positions. To tackle the resultant non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) scheme underpinned by successive convex approximation (SCA) to converge towards a stationary point. Through numerical simulations, our findings substantiate the superiority of the MA-assisted NOMA system over both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and conventional NOMA configurations in terms of average sum rate and outage probability.</description>

      <title>FlocOff: Data Heterogeneity Resilient Federated Learning with Communication-Efficient Edge Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a fundamental learning paradigm to harness massive data scattered at geo-distributed edge devices in a privacy-preserving way. Given the heterogeneous deployment of edge devices, however, their data are usually Non-IID, introducing significant challenges to FL including degraded training accuracy, intensive communication costs, and high computing complexity. Towards that, traditional approaches typically utilize adaptive mechanisms, which may suffer from scalability issues, increased computational overhead, and limited adaptability to diverse edge environments. To address that, this paper instead leverages the observation that the computation offloading involves inherent functionalities such as node matching and service correlation to achieve data reshaping and proposes Federated learning based on computing Offloading (FlocOff) framework, to address data heterogeneity and resource-constrained challenges. Specifically, FlocOff formulates the FL process with Non-IID data in edge scenarios and derives rigorous analysis on the impact of imbalanced data distribution. Based on this, FlocOff decouples the optimization in two steps, namely : (1) Minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence via Computation Offloading scheduling (MKL-CO); (2) Minimizes the Communication Cost through Resource Allocation (MCC-RA). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FlocOff effectively improves model convergence and accuracy by 14.3\%-32.7\% while reducing data heterogeneity under various data distributions.</description>

Abstract: Optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) offers a new and effective approach to resolving the line-of-sight blockage issue in visible light communication (VLC) by enabling redirection of light to bypass obstacles, thereby dramatically enhancing indoor VLC coverage and reliability. This article provides a comprehensive overview of OIRS for VLC, including channel modeling, design techniques, and open issues. First, we present the characteristics of OIRS-reflected channels and introduce two practical models, namely, optics model and association model, which are then compared in terms of applicable conditions, configuration methods, and channel parameters. Next, under the more practically appealing association model, we discuss the main design techniques for OIRS-aided VLC systems, including beam alignment, channel estimation, and OIRS reflection optimization. Finally, open issues are identified to stimulate future research in this area.</description>

      <title>EVM Analysis of Distributed Massive MIMO with 1-Bit Radio-Over-Fiber Fronthaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the uplink performance of a distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture in which the remotely located access points (APs) are connected to a central processing unit via a fiber-optical fronthaul carrying a dithered and 1-bit quantized version of the received radio-frequency (RF) signal. The innovative feature of the proposed architecture is that no down-conversion is performed at the APs. This eliminates the need to equip the APs with local oscillators, which may be difficult to synchronize. Under the assumption that a constraint is imposed on the amount of data that can be exchanged across the fiber-optical fronthaul, we investigate the tradeoff between spatial oversampling, defined in terms of the total number of APs, and temporal oversampling, defined in terms of the oversampling factor selected at the central processing unit, to facilitate the recovery of the transmitted signal from 1-bit samples of the RF received signal. Using the so-called error-vector magnitude (EVM) as performance metric, we shed light on the optimal design of the dither signal, and quantify, for a given number of APs, the minimum fronthaul rate required for our proposed distributed massive MIMO architecture to outperform a standard co-located massive MIMO architecture in terms of EVM.</description>

      <title>Achievable Rate Optimization for Large Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces Based on Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) is an emerging design that consists of multiple layers of metasurfaces. A SIM enables holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) precoding in the wave domain, which results in the reduction of energy consumption and hardware cost. On the ground of multiuser beamforming, this letter focuses on the downlink achievable rate and its maximization. Contrary to previous works on multiuser SIM, we consider statistical channel state information (CSI) as opposed to instantaneous CSI to overcome challenges such as large overhead. Also, we examine the performance of large surfaces. We apply an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm regarding the phases of the SIM and the allocated transmit power. Simulations illustrate the performance of the considered large SIM-assisted design as well as the comparison between different CSI considerations.</description>

Abstract: Motor Imagery (MI) is gaining traction in both rehabilitation and sports settings, but its immediate influence on human postural control is not yet clearly understood. The focus of this study is to examine the effects of MI on the dynamics of the Center of Pressure (COP), a crucial metric for evaluating postural stability. In the experiment, thirty healthy young adults participated in four different scenarios: normal standing with both open and closed eyes, and kinesthetic motor imagery focused on mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) sway movements. A mathematical model was developed to characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the COP and to assess the impact of MI on these dynamics. Our results show a statistically significant increase (p-value&lt;0.05) in variables such as COP path length and Long-Range Correlation (LRC) during MI compared to the closed-eye and normal standing conditions. These observations align well with psycho-neuromuscular theory, which suggests that imagining a specific movement activates neural pathways, consequently affecting postural control. This study presents compelling evidence that motor imagery not only has a quantifiable impact on COP dynamics but also that changes in the Center of Pressure (COP) are directionally consistent with the imagined movements. This finding holds significant implications for the field of rehabilitation science, suggesting that motor imagery could be strategically utilized to induce targeted postural adjustments. Nonetheless, additional research is required to fully understand the complex mechanisms that underlie this relationship and to corroborate these results across a more diverse set of populations.</description>

      <title>Network Connectivity--Information Freshness Tradeoff in Information Dissemination Over Networks</title>

Abstract: We consider a gossip network consisting of a source generating updates and $n$ nodes connected according to a given graph structure. The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated or observed, and shares them with the gossiping network. The nodes in the network communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the timeliness of information at the nodes. We first find an upper bound for the average version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we find the average version age scaling of a node in several network graph structures, such as two-dimensional grids, generalized rings and hyper-cubes. Prior to our work, it was known that when $n$ nodes are connected on a ring the version age scales as $O(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$, and when they are connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as $O(\log n)$. Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure other than the ring and the fully-connected network, which constitute the two extremes of network connectivity. Our work helps fill the gap between these two extremes by analyzing a large variety of graphs with intermediate connectivity, thus providing insight into the relationship between the connectivity structure of the network and the version age, and uncovering a network connectivity--information freshness tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Towards a Low-SWaP 1024-beam Digital Array: A 32-beam Sub-system at 5.8 GHz</title>

Abstract: Millimeter wave communications require multibeam beamforming in order to utilize wireless channels that suffer from obstructions, path loss, and multi-path effects. Digital multibeam beamforming has maximum degrees of freedom compared to analog phased arrays. However, circuit complexity and power consumption are important constraints for digital multibeam systems. A low-complexity digital computing architecture is proposed for a multiplication-free 32-point linear transform that approximates multiple simultaneous RF beams similar to a discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Arithmetic complexity due to multiplication is reduced from the FFT complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\: \log N)$ for DFT realizations, down to zero, thus yielding a 46% and 55% reduction in chip area and dynamic power consumption, respectively, for the $N=32$ case considered. The paper describes the proposed 32-point DFT approximation targeting a 1024-beams using a 2D array, and shows the multiplierless approximation and its mapping to a 32-beam sub-system consisting of 5.8 GHz antennas that can be used for generating 1024 digital beams without multiplications. Real-time beam computation is achieved using a Xilinx FPGA at 120 MHz bandwidth per beam. Theoretical beam performance is compared with measured RF patterns from both a fixed-point FFT as well as the proposed multiplier-free algorithm and are in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Short-Reach Optical Systems: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, extensive research has been conducted to explore the utilization of machine learning algorithms in various direct-detected and self-coherent short-reach communication applications. These applications encompass a wide range of tasks, including bandwidth request prediction, signal quality monitoring, fault detection, traffic prediction, and digital signal processing (DSP)-based equalization. As a versatile approach, machine learning demonstrates the ability to address stochastic phenomena in optical systems networks where deterministic methods may fall short. However, when it comes to DSP equalization algorithms, their performance improvements are often marginal, and their complexity is prohibitively high, especially in cost-sensitive short-reach communications scenarios such as passive optical networks (PONs). They excel in capturing temporal dependencies, handling irregular or nonlinear patterns effectively, and accommodating variable time intervals. Within this extensive survey, we outline the application of machine learning techniques in short-reach communications, specifically emphasizing their utilization in high-bandwidth demanding PONs. Notably, we introduce a novel taxonomy for time-series methods employed in machine learning signal processing, providing a structured classification framework. Our taxonomy categorizes current time series methods into four distinct groups: traditional methods, Fourier convolution-based methods, transformer-based models, and time-series convolutional networks. Finally, we highlight prospective research directions within this rapidly evolving field and outline specific solutions to mitigate the complexity associated with hardware implementations. We aim to pave the way for more practical and efficient deployment of machine learning approaches in short-reach optical communication systems by addressing complexity concerns.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel FPGA-based neuromorphic cochlea, leveraging the general-purpose spike-coding algorithm, Spiketrum. The focus of this study is on the development and characterization of this cochlea model, which excels in transforming audio vibrations into biologically realistic auditory spike trains. These spike trains are designed to withstand neural fluctuations and spike losses while accurately encapsulating the spatial and precise temporal characteristics of audio, along with the intensity of incoming vibrations. Noteworthy features include the ability to generate real-time spike trains with minimal information loss and the capacity to reconstruct original signals. This fine-tuning capability allows users to optimize spike rates, achieving an optimal balance between output quality and power consumption. Furthermore, the integration of a feedback system into Spiketrum enables selective amplification of specific features while attenuating others, facilitating adaptive power consumption based on application requirements. The hardware implementation supports both spike-based and non-spike-based processors, making it versatile for various computing systems. The cochlea's ability to encode diverse sensory information, extending beyond sound waveforms, positions it as a promising sensory input for current and future spike-based intelligent computing systems, offering compact and real-time spike train generation.</description>

      <title>Application based Evaluation of an Efficient Spike-Encoder, "Spiketrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>Soft Multipath Information-Based UWB Tracking in Cluttered Scenarios: Preliminaries and Validations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate ultra-wideband (UWB) localization and tracking in cluttered environments. Instead of mitigating the multipath, we exploit the specular reflections to enhance the localizability and improve the positioning accuracy. With the assistance of the multipath, it is also possible to achieve localization purposes using fewer anchors or when the line-of-sight propagations are blocked. Rather than using single-value distance, angle, or Doppler estimates for the localization, we model the likelihoods of both the line-of-sight and specular multipath components, namely soft multipath information, and propose the multipath-assisted probabilistic UWB tracking algorithm. Experimental results in a cluttered industrial scenario show that the proposed algorithm achieves 46.4 cm and 33.1 cm 90th percentile errors in the cases of 3 and 4 anchors, respectively, which outperforms conventional methods with more than 61.8% improvement given fewer anchors and strong multipath effect.</description>

      <title>Insights from the Design Space Exploration of Flow-Guided Nanoscale Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanodevices with Terahertz (THz)-based wireless communication capabilities are providing a primer for flow-guided localization within the human bloodstreams. Such localization is allowing for assigning the locations of sensed events with the events themselves, providing benefits in precision medicine along the lines of early and precise diagnostics, and reduced costs and invasiveness. Flow-guided localization is still in a rudimentary phase, with only a handful of works targeting the problem. Nonetheless, the performance assessments of the proposed solutions are already carried out in a non-standardized way, usually along a single performance metric, and ignoring various aspects that are relevant at such a scale (e.g., nanodevices' limited energy) and for such a challenging environment (e.g., extreme attenuation of in-body THz propagation). As such, these assessments feature low levels of realism and cannot be compared in an objective way. Toward addressing this issue, we account for the environmental and scale-related peculiarities of the scenario and assess the performance of two state-of-the-art flow-guided localization approaches along a set of heterogeneous performance metrics such as the accuracy and reliability of localization.</description>

      <title>FaultFormer: Pretraining Transformers for Adaptable Bearing Fault Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of global consumption has motivated important applications of deep learning to smart manufacturing and machine health monitoring. In particular, analyzing vibration data offers great potential to extract meaningful insights into predictive maintenance by the detection of bearing faults. Deep learning can be a powerful method to predict these mechanical failures; however, they lack generalizability to new tasks or datasets and require expensive, labeled mechanical data. We address this by presenting a novel self-supervised pretraining and fine-tuning framework based on transformer models. In particular, we investigate different tokenization and data augmentation strategies to reach state-of-the-art accuracies using transformer models. Furthermore, we demonstrate self-supervised masked pretraining for vibration signals and its application to low-data regimes, task adaptation, and dataset adaptation. Pretraining is able to improve performance on scarce, unseen training samples, as well as when fine-tuning on fault classes outside of the pretraining distribution. Furthermore, pretrained transformers are shown to be able to generalize to a different dataset in a few-shot manner. This introduces a new paradigm where models can be pretrained on unlabeled data from different bearings, faults, and machinery and quickly deployed to new, data-scarce applications to suit specific manufacturing needs.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06054v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</description>
