      <title>Mathematical models for the EP2 and EP4 signaling pathways and their crosstalk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The G-protein coupled receptors EP2 and EP4 both transduce the signal of the lipid messenger Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Changes in the cell response to PGE2 can have important effects on immunity and development of diseases, however, a thorough understanding of the EP2-EP4 receptors' signaling pathways is lacking. Experimental data show that receptor activity (indicated by cAMP expression) has a different kinetics depending on which receptor is triggered by PGE2 and that crosstalk exists between EP2 and EP4. To better understand the underlying mechanisms and be able to predict cell responses to PGE2, we develop novel mathematical models for the cAMP signaling pathways of EP2 and EP4 and their crosstalk. Ligand binding dynamics plays a crucial role for both, the single receptor activity and their crosstalk. The mathematical models can predict the qualitative cAMP levels observed experimentally and provide possible explanations for the differences and commonalities in the signaling behavior of EP2 and EP4. As inhibition of PGE2 signaling is gaining increasing attention in tumor immunology, these mathematical models could contribute to design effective anti-tumor therapies targeting EP2 and EP4.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Driven Dynamical Model for Axonal Extension on Parallel Micropatterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in understanding neuronal development, a fully quantitative framework that integrates intracellular mechanisms with environmental cues during axonal growth remains incomplete. Here, we present a unified biophysical model that captures key mechanochemical processes governing axonal extension on micropatterned substrates. In these environments, axons preferentially align with the pattern direction, form bundles, and advance at constant speed. The model integrates four core components: (i) actin-adhesion traction coupling, (ii) lateral inhibition between neighboring axons, (iii) tubulin transport from soma to the growth cone, and (4) orientation dynamics guided by the substrate anisotropy. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that the saddle-node bifurcation in the actin adhesion subsystem drives a transition to a high-traction motile state, while traction feedback shifts a pitchfork bifurcation in the signaling loop, promoting symmetry breaking and robust alignment. An exact linear solution in the tubulin transport subsystem functions as a built-in speed regulator, ensuring stable elongation rates. Simulations using experimentally inferred parameters accurately reproduce elongation speed, alignment variance, and bundle spacing. The model provides explicit design rules for enhancing axonal alignment through modulation of substrate stiffness and adhesion dynamics. By identifying key control parameters, this work enables rational design of biomaterials for neural repair and engineered tissue systems.</description>
