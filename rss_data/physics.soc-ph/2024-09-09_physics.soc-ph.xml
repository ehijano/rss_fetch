      <title>Dominant strategy in repeated games on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct reciprocity, stemming from repeated interactions among players, is one of the fundamental mechanisms for understanding the evolution of cooperation. However, canonical strategies for the repeated prisoner's dilemma, such as Win-Stay-Lose-Shift and Tit-for-Tat, fail to consistently dominate alternative strategies during evolution. This complexity intensifies with the introduction of spatial structure or network behind individual interactions, where nodes represent players and edges represent their interactions. Here, we propose a new strategy, ``Cooperate-Stay-Defect-Tolerate" (CSDT), which can dominate other strategies within networked populations by adhering to three essential characteristics. This strategy maintains current behaviour when the opponent cooperates and tolerates defection to a limited extent when the opponent defects. We demonstrate that the limit of tolerance of CSDT can vary with the network structure, evolutionary dynamics, and game payoffs. Furthermore, we find that incorporating the Always Defect strategy (ALLD) can enhance the evolution of CSDT and eliminate strategies that are vulnerable to defection in the population, providing a new interpretation of the role of ALLD in direct reciprocity. Our findings offer a novel perspective on how cooperative strategy evolves on networked populations.</description>

      <title>Understanding changes in traffic demand during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluated the effects of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games on traffic demand on the Metropolitan expressway. We constructed panel data for both passenger and freight vehicles' demand using longitudinal disaggregated trip records from the Metropolitan expressway. Subsequently, we established a demand function and used a difference-in-differences method to individually estimate the impacts of toll surcharges and other Olympics-related factors by leveraging the fact that the toll surcharges were not applied to freight vehicles.
  The results indicate that toll surcharges resulted in a decrease of 25.0 % for weekdays and 36.8 % for weekends/holidays in passenger vehicle demand on the Metropolitan expressway. The estimated toll elasticities are 0.345 for weekdays and 0.615 for weekends/holidays, respectively. Notably, analysis of the Olympics-related factor demonstrated that travel demand management (TDM) strategies effectively curbed demand on weekends/holidays with a reduction of 2.9 % in traffic demand. However, on weekdays, induced demand surpassed the reduction of demand by other TDM strategies than tolling, resulting in a 4.6 % increase in traffic demand.
  Additionally, We developed a zone-based demand function and investigate the spatial heterogeneity in toll elasticity. Our findings revealed small heterogeneity for weekdays (0.283 to 0.509) and large heterogeneity for weekends/holidays (0.484 to 0.935).</description>

      <title>Indirect reciprocity under opinion synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a key explanation for the exceptional magnitude of cooperation among humans. This literature suggests that a large proportion of human cooperation is driven by social norms and individuals' incentives to maintain a good reputation. This intuition has been formalized with two types of models. In public assessment models, all community members are assumed to agree on each others' reputations; in private assessment models, people may have disagreements. Both types of models aim to understand the interplay of social norms and cooperation. Yet their results can be vastly different. Public assessment models argue that cooperation can evolve easily, and that the most effective norms tend to be stern. Private assessment models often find cooperation to be unstable, and successful norms show some leniency. Here, we propose a model that can organize these differing results within a single framework. We show that the stability of cooperation depends on a single quantity: the extent to which individual opinions turn out to be correlated. This correlation is determined by a group's norms and the structure of social interactions. In particular, we prove that no cooperative norm is evolutionarily stable when individual opinions are statistically independent. These results have important implications for our understanding of cooperation, conformity, and polarization.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on demographic mortality at high ages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10279v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of modeling and therefore predicting the trend of demographic mortality is of great scientific and social interest. The article presents and discusses the hypothesis that the demographic distribution of mortality in advanced ages converges asymptotically to an S-system distribution as lifespan increases. The statistical distribution of the S-system was introduced by the author in a 2022 paper and was derived by applying the methods of Fermi statistics to a cellular automaton acting as an "arbitrary oscillator". This distribution is here recalled and formalized analytically and its characteristics are described. The conjecture is based on two case studies: mortality in the United States from 1900 to 2017 and mortality in Italy from 1974 to 2019. The conjecture, applied to both case studies, appears reasonable. Tables and comparison figures are provided to support this. Finally, an attempt to predict demographic mortality behavior and limitations for the years to come is provided.</description>

      <title>Multiplex measures for higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide variety of complex systems are characterized by interactions of different types involving varying numbers of units. Multiplex hypergraphs serve as a tool to describe such structures, capturing distinct types of higher-order interactions among a collection of units. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive set of measures to describe structural connectivity patterns in multiplex hypergraphs, considering scales from node and hyperedge levels to the system's mesoscale. We validate our measures with three real-world datasets: scientific co-authorship in physics, movie collaborations, and high school interactions. This validation reveals new collaboration patterns, identifies trends within and across movie subfields, and provides insights into daily interaction dynamics. Our framework aims to offer a more nuanced characterization of real-world systems marked by both multiplex and higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Signature of maturity in cryptocurrency volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations, particularly the inequality of fluctuations, in cryptocurrency prices over the last ten years. We calculate the inequality in the price fluctuations through different measures, such as the Gini and Kolkata indices, and also the $Q$ factor (given by the ratio between the highest value and the average value) of these fluctuations. We compare the results with the equivalent quantities in some of the more prominent national currencies and see that while the fluctuations (or inequalities in such fluctuations) for cryptocurrencies were initially significantly higher than national currencies, over time the fluctuation levels of cryptocurrencies tend towards the levels characteristic of national currencies. We also compare similar quantities for a few prominent stock prices.</description>

      <title>A Review of Graph Neural Networks in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in studying epidemiological models. Traditional mechanistic models mathematically describe the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases. However, they often suffer from limitations of oversimplified or fixed assumptions, which could cause sub-optimal predictive power and inefficiency in capturing complex relation information. Consequently, Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) have emerged as a progressively popular tool in epidemic research. In this paper, we endeavor to furnish a comprehensive review of GNNs in epidemic tasks and highlight potential future directions. To accomplish this objective, we introduce hierarchical taxonomies for both epidemic tasks and methodologies, offering a trajectory of development within this domain. For epidemic tasks, we establish a taxonomy akin to those typically employed within the epidemic domain. For methodology, we categorize existing work into Neural Models and Hybrid Models. Following this, we perform an exhaustive and systematic examination of the methodologies, encompassing both the tasks and their technical details. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing methods from diverse perspectives and systematically propose future research directions. This survey aims to bridge literature gaps and promote the progression of this promising field, with a list of relevant papers at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/awesome-epidemic-modeling-papers. We hope that it will facilitate synergies between the communities of GNNs and epidemiology, and contribute to their collective progress.</description>

      <title>Integration vs segregation: evidence from measuring and comparing interdisciplinarity in funded and unfunded research using a network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research fuels innovation. However, research investment has been found to have become more conservative and highly interdisciplinary ideas tend to be punished during research evaluation. How does this affect the interdisciplinarity of research output? To answer this question, our study presents a novel network approach by comparing the evolution of interdisciplinarity in funded research against unfunded research. Considering the field of infectious disease research, the analysis of temporal networks reveals (i) the growing compartmentalisation of funded research, i.e., it becomes more conservative and focuses on the groups of knowledge with readily established connections, and (ii) the growth in global integration in unfunded research, i.e., it tends to be more widely exploratory and links distant knowledge. In addition, we find that in general funded research is less interdisciplinary than unfunded research but this effect decreases through time. Moreover, we observe that interdisciplinary research on prominent infectious diseases like HIV tends to have strong bridging effects facilitating global knowledge integration in the network. In terms of the coronavirus research, despite the surge in publications since COVID-19, we find its systematic impact on knowledge integration remains relatively low. Overall, this research provides detailed insights into the impact of conservatism in funding interdisciplinary research, allows for the identification of under/over-funded interdisciplinary research areas, and offers valuable implications for policymakers aiming to foster interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <title>Predictability maximization and the origins of word order harmony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.</description>
