      <title>Pseudo-Anosov Flows: A Plane Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this text we (re)-tell the theory of pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds with the orbit space as the central character; via a streamlined framework called {\em Anosov-like group actions}. This brings a simplified and unified perspective, and allows for the import of tools from 1- and 2-dimensional topological dynamics. In so doing, we are able to give a relatively efficient presentation (or re-presentation) of foundational results in the field which appeared over several decades and many papers.
  We hope that the reader, whether a beginning or more advanced topologist or dynamicist, finds this a welcoming invitation to the rich theory of pseudo-Anosov flows.</description>

      <title>Interval Estimation for Bounded Jacobian Nonlinear Systems by Zonotope Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an interval state estimation method for discrete-time bounded Jacobian nonlinear systems allying Luenberger-like observer with zonotope set computation. First, a robust observer is designed to obtain bounded-error and point-estimation with a peak-to-peak performance. This allows one to cope with the unknown but bounded process disturbance and measurement noise. Then, based on the stable dynamics of the observation error, tight interval estimation is obtained by applying zonotope set computation and analysis. To sum up, a comprehensive interval estimation algorithm is proposed by integrating the robust (in the sense of peak-to-peak performance index) point-valued estimate with the feasible zonotope set of the estimation error. Numerical simulation tests are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Localmax dynamics for attention in transformers and its asymptotic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new discrete-time attention model, termed the localmax dynamics, which interpolates between the classic softmax dynamics and the hardmax dynamics, where only the tokens that maximize the influence toward a given token have a positive weight. As in hardmax, uniform weights are determined by a parameter controlling neighbor influence, but the key extension lies in relaxing neighborhood interactions through an alignment-sensitivity parameter, which allows controlled deviations from pure hardmax behavior. As we prove, while the convex hull of the token states still converges to a convex polytope, its structure can no longer be fully described by a maximal alignment set, prompting the introduction of quiescent sets to capture the invariant behavior of tokens near vertices. We show that these sets play a key role in understanding the asymptotic behavior of the system, even under time-varying alignment sensitivity parameters. We further show that localmax dynamics does not exhibit finite-time convergence and provide results for vanishing, nonzero, time-varying alignment-sensitivity parameters, recovering the limiting behavior of hardmax as a by-product. Finally, we adapt Lyapunov-based methods from classical opinion dynamics, highlighting their limitations in the asymmetric setting of localmax interactions and outlining directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Solvability Complexity Index Classification For Koopman Operator Spectra In $L^p$ For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of the approximate point spectrum and the approximate point $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of bounded Koopman operators acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X}, d_{\mathcal{X}})$ with finite Borel measure $\omega$. Building on finite sections in a computable unconditional Schauder basis of $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$, we design residual tests that use only finitely many evaluations of the underlying map and produce compact sets on a planar grid, that converge in the Hausdorff metric to the target spectral sets, without spectral pollution. From these constructions we obtain a complete classification, in the sense of the Solvability Complexity Index, of how many limiting procedures are inherently necessary. Also we analyze the sufficiency and existence of a Wold-von Neumann decomposition analog, that was used in the special $L^2$-case.
  The main difficulty in extending from the already analyzed Hilbert setting $(p=2)$ to general $L^p$ is the loss of orthogonality and Hilbertian structure: there is no orthonormal basis with orthogonal coordinate projections in general, the canonical truncations $E_n$ in a computable Schauder dictionary need not be contractive (and may oscillate) and the Wold-von Neumann reduction has no directly computable analog in $L^p$. We overcome these obstacles by working with computable unconditional dictionaries adapted to dyadic/Lipschitz filtrations and proving stability of residual tests under non-orthogonal truncations.</description>

      <title>Analytic Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel EDMD-type algorithm that captures the spectrum of the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of analytic functions. This method, which we call analytic EDMD, relies on an orthogonal projection on polynomial subspaces, which is equivalent to a data-driven Taylor approximation. In the case of dynamics with a hyperbolic equilibrium, analytic EDMD demonstrates excellent performance to capture the lattice-structured Koopman spectrum based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system at the equilibrium. Moreover, it yields the Taylor approximation of associated principal eigenfunctions. Since the method preserves the triangular structure of the operator, it does not suffer from spectral pollution and, moreover, arbitrary accuracy on the spectrum can be reached with a fixed finite dimension of the approximation. The performance of analytic EDMD is illustrated with numerical examples and is assessed through a comparative study with related methods. Finally, the method is complemented with theoretical results, proving strong convergence of the eigenfunctions and providing error bounds on the spectrum estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we characterise the statistics of Markov chains by constructing an associated sequence of periodic differential operators. Studying the density of states of these operators reveals the absolutely continuous invariant measure of the Markov chain. This approach also leads to a direct proof of convergence to the invariant measure, along with explicit convergence rates. We show how our method can be applied to a class of related Markov chains including the logistic map, the tent map and Chebyshev maps of arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>Improved polynomial rates of memory loss for nonstationary intermittent dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonstationary dynamical systems formed by sequential concatenation of nonuniformly expanding maps with a uniformly expanding first return map. Assuming a polynomially decaying upper bound on the tails of first return times that is nonuniform with respect to location in the sequence, we derive a corresponding sharp polynomial rate of memory loss. As applications, we obtain new estimates on the rate of memory loss for random ergodic compositions of Pomeau--Manneville type intermittent maps and intermittent maps with unbounded derivatives.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of the boundaries of attracting basins of entire maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ be a transcendental entire map from the Eremenko-Lyubich class $\mathcal{B}$, and let $\zeta$ be an attracting periodic point of period $p$. We prove that the boundaries of components of the attracting basin of (the orbit of) $\zeta$ have hyperbolic (and, consequently, Hausdorff) dimension larger than $1$, provided $f^p$ has an infinite degree on an immediate component $U$ of the basin, and the singular set of $f^p|_U$ is compactly contained in $U$. The same holds for the boundaries of components of the basin of a parabolic $p$-periodic point $\zeta$, under the additional assumption $\zeta \notin \overline{{\text{Sing}}(f^p)}$. We also prove that if an immediate component of an attracting basin of an arbitrary transcendental entire map is bounded, then the boundaries of components of the basin have hyperbolic dimension larger than $1$. This enables us to show that the boundary of a component of an attracting basin of a transcendental entire function is never a smooth or rectifiable curve. The results provide a partial answer to a question from Hayman's list of problems in function theory.</description>

Abstract: We study degenerate singular points of planar vector fields inside a (degenerated) flow-box. These kind of singularities are called fake saddles and their linear parts are always zero. We characterize fake saddles with non-zero second order jet and we give the first term of an uniform asymptotic expansion of the Poincar\'e map between two transverse sections to their corresponding singular fiber, determining its stability.</description>

      <title>Homology and K-theory for self-similar actions of groups and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nekrashevych associated to each self-similar group action an ample groupoid and a $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra. We perform complete computations of the homology of the groupoid and the K-theory of the $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra for a myriad of examples, including the Grigorchuk group, the Grigorchuk--Erschler group, Gupta--Sidki groups, and self-similar actions of free abelian groups and lamplighter groups. The key development is the construction, for arbitrary self-similar group actions, of long exact sequences which compute the homology and K-theory in terms of the homology of the group and K-theory of the group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra via the transfer map and the virtual endomorphism. Results are proved more generally for self-similar groupoids. As a consequence of our results and recent results of X.~Li, we are able to show that R\"over's simple group containing the Grigorchuk group and Thompson's group $V$ is rationally acyclic but has nontrivial Schur multiplier. We prove many more R\"over--Nekrashevych groups of self-similar groups are rationally acyclic.</description>

      <title>Multi-set spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the supra-Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with universality properties of composition operators $C_f$, where the symbol $f$ is given by a transcendental entire function restricted to parts of its Fatou set. We determine universality of $C_f$ when $f$ is restricted to (subsets of) Baker and wandering domains. We then describe the behaviour of universal vectors, under the action of iterates of the symbol $f$, near periodic points of $f$ or near infinity. Finally, we establish a principal universality theorem for the more general class of weighted composition operators, which we then apply to uncover universality results in the context of various types of Fatou components of the associated symbol.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices for Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems span multiple spatial and temporal scales, making their dynamics challenging to understand and predict. This challenge is especially daunting when one wants to study localized and/or rare events. Advances in dynamical systems theory, including the development of state-dependent dynamical indices, namely local dimension and persistence, have provided powerful tools for studying these phenomena. However, existing applications of such indices rely on a predefined and fixed spatial domain, that provides a single scalar quantity for the entire region of interest. This aspect prevents understanding the spatially localized dynamical behavior of the system. In this work, we introduce Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices (SDIs), that leverage the existing framework of state-dependent local dimension and persistence. SDIs are obtained via a sliding window approach, enabling the exploration of space-dependent properties in spatio-temporal data. As an example, we show that, through this framework, we are able to reconcile previously different perspectives on European summertime heatwaves. This result showcases the importance of accounting for spatial scales when performing scale-dependent dynamical analyses.</description>

      <title>Locally homogeneous Axiom A flows II: geometric structures for Anosov subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a non-compact semisimple real Lie group $G$ and an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$, we utilize the correspondence between $\mathbb R$-valued additive characters on Levi subgroups $L$ of $G$ and $\mathbb R$-affine homogeneous line bundles over $G/L$ to systematically construct families of non-empty domains of proper discontinuity for the $\Gamma$-action. If $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, the analytic dynamical systems on the quotients are Axiom A, and assemble into a single partially hyperbolic multiflow. Each Axiom A system admits global analytic stable/unstable foliations with non-wandering set a single basic set on which the flow is conjugate to Sambarino's refraction flow, establishing that all refraction flows arise in this fashion. Furthermore, the $\mathbb R$-valued additive character is regular if and only if the associated Axiom A system admits a compatible pseudo-Riemannian metric and contact structure, which we relate to the Poisson structure on the dual of the Lie algebra of $G$.</description>

      <title>Lindblad evolution as gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the complex $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the real $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.</description>
