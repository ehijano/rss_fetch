      <title>Emulating OP_RAND in Bitcoin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method of emulation of OP_RAND opcode on Bitcoin through a trustless interactive game between transaction counterparties. The game result is probabilistic and doesn't allow any party to cheat and increase their chance to win on any protocol step. The protocol can be organized in a way unrecognizable to any external party and doesn't require some specific scripts or Bitcoin protocol updates. We will show how the protocol works on the simple Thimbles Game and provide some initial thoughts about approaches and applications that can use the mentioned approach.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Using LLMs to Execute Multistage Network Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have shown preliminary promise in some security tasks and CTF challenges. However, it is unclear whether LLMs are able to realize multistage network attacks, which involve executing a wide variety of actions across multiple hosts such as conducting reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities to gain initial access, leveraging internal hosts to move laterally, and using multiple compromised hosts to exfiltrate data. We evaluate LLMs across 10 multistage networks and find that popular LLMs are unable to realize these attacks. To enable LLMs to realize these attacks, we introduce Incalmo, an LLM-agnostic high-level attack abstraction layer that sits between an LLM and the environment. Rather than LLMs issuing low-level command-line instructions, which can lead to incorrect implementations, Incalmo allows LLMs to specify high-level tasks (e.g., infect a host, scan a network), which are then carried out by Incalmo. Incalmo realizes these tasks by translating them into low-level primitives (e.g., commands to exploit tools). Incalmo also provides an environment state service and an attack graph service to provide structure to LLMs in selecting actions relevant to a multistage attack. Across 9 out of 10 realistic emulated networks (from 25 to 50 hosts), LLMs using Incalmo can successfully autonomously execute multistage attacks. We also conduct an ablation analysis to show the key role the high-level abstractions play. For instance, we find that both Incalmo's high-level tasks and services are crucial. Furthermore, even smaller-parameter LLMs with Incalmo can fully succeed in 5 of 10 environments, while larger-parameter LLMs without Incalmo do not fully succeed in any.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Stability Prediction in Smart Grids: GAN-based Approach under Data Constraints and Adversarial Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart grids are critical for addressing the growing energy demand due to global population growth and urbanization. They enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability by integrating renewable energy. Ensuring their availability and safety requires advanced operational control and safety measures. Researchers employ AI and machine learning to assess grid stability, but challenges like the lack of datasets and cybersecurity threats, including adversarial attacks, persist. In particular, data scarcity is a key issue: obtaining grid instability instances is tough due to the need for significant expertise, resources, and time. However, they are essential to test novel research advancements and security mitigations. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to detect instability in smart grids by employing only stable data. It relies on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the generator is trained to create instability data that are used along with stable data to train the discriminator. Moreover, we include a new adversarial training layer to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. Our solution, tested on a dataset composed of real-world stable and unstable samples, achieve accuracy up to 97.5\% in predicting grid stability and up to 98.9\% in detecting adversarial attacks. Moreover, we implemented our model in a single-board computer demonstrating efficient real-time decision-making with an average response time of less than 7ms. Our solution improves prediction accuracy and resilience while addressing data scarcity in smart grid management.</description>

      <title>Targeting Alignment: Extracting Safety Classifiers of Aligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is used to enforce guidelines such as safety. Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we present and evaluate a method to assess the robustness of LLM alignment. We observe that alignment embeds a safety classifier in the target model that is responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance. We seek to extract an approximation of this classifier, called a surrogate classifier, from the LLM. We develop an algorithm for identifying candidate classifiers from subsets of the LLM model. We evaluate the degree to which the candidate classifiers approximate the model's embedded classifier in benign (F1 score) and adversarial (using surrogates in a white-box attack) settings. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model architecture. Further, we find attacks mounted on the surrogate models can be transferred with high accuracy. For example, a surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate (ASR) of 70%, a substantial improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR. These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is a viable (and highly effective) means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of aligned models to jailbreaking attacks.</description>

      <title>Distributional Information Embedding: A Framework for Multi-bit Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel problem, distributional information embedding, motivated by the practical demands of multi-bit watermarking for large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional information embedding, which embeds information into a pre-existing host signal, LLM watermarking actively controls the text generation process--adjusting the token distribution--to embed a detectable signal. We develop an information-theoretic framework to analyze this distributional information embedding problem, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs among three critical performance metrics: text quality, detectability, and information rate. In the asymptotic regime, we demonstrate that the maximum achievable rate with vanishing error corresponds to the entropy of the LLM's output distribution and increases with higher allowable distortion. We also characterize the optimal watermarking scheme to achieve this rate. Extending the analysis to the finite-token case, we identify schemes that maximize detection probability while adhering to constraints on false alarm and distortion.</description>

      <title>SHIELD: Secure Host-Independent Extensible Logging for SATA/Network Storage Towards Ransomware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As malware such as ransomware becomes sophisticated, the ability to find and neutralize it requires more robust and tamper-resistant solutions. Current methods rely on data from compromised hosts, lack hardware isolation, and cannot detect emerging threats. To address these limitations, we introduce SHIELD - a detection architecture leveraging FPGA-based open-source SATA and Network Block Device (NBD) technology to provide off-host, tamper-proof measurements for continuous observation of disk activity for software executing on a target device. SHIELD provides three distinct contributions: It (1) develops a framework to obtain and analyze multi-level hardware metrics at NBD, FPGA, and SATA storage levels, and shows their ability to differentiate between harmless and malicious software; (2) Broadens the functionality of an open-source FPGA-driven SATA Host Bus Adapter (HBA) to offer complete data storage capabilities through NBD without relying on the host system; (3) Provides a foundation for using the methodology and metrics in automated machine learning-assisted detection and ASIC integration for advanced mitigation capabilities in data storage devices. SHIELD analyzes 10 benign programs and 10 modern ransomware families to illustrate its capacity for real-time monitoring and use in distinguishing between ransomware and benign software. Experimental evidence shows SHIELD's robust host-independent and hardware-assisted metrics are a basis for detection, allowing to observe program execution and detect malicious activities at the storage level.</description>

      <title>Data Duplication: A Novel Multi-Purpose Attack Paradigm in Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duplication is a prevalent issue within datasets. Existing research has demonstrated that the presence of duplicated data in training datasets can significantly influence both model performance and data privacy. However, the impact of data duplication on the unlearning process remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by pioneering a comprehensive investigation into the role of data duplication, not only in standard machine unlearning but also in federated and reinforcement unlearning paradigms. Specifically, we propose an adversary who duplicates a subset of the target model's training set and incorporates it into the training set. After training, the adversary requests the model owner to unlearn this duplicated subset, and analyzes the impact on the unlearned model. For example, the adversary can challenge the model owner by revealing that, despite efforts to unlearn it, the influence of the duplicated subset remains in the model. Moreover, to circumvent detection by de-duplication techniques, we propose three novel near-duplication methods for the adversary, each tailored to a specific unlearning paradigm. We then examine their impacts on the unlearning process when de-duplication techniques are applied. Our findings reveal several crucial insights: 1) the gold standard unlearning method, retraining from scratch, fails to effectively conduct unlearning under certain conditions; 2) unlearning duplicated data can lead to significant model degradation in specific scenarios; and 3) meticulously crafted duplicates can evade detection by de-duplication methods.</description>

      <title>Data-Free Model-Related Attacks: Unleashing the Potential of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI technology has become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, offering powerful capabilities to enhance productivity. However, these same capabilities can be exploited by adversaries for malicious purposes. While existing research on adversarial applications of generative AI predominantly focuses on cyberattacks, less attention has been given to attacks targeting deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce the use of generative AI for facilitating model-related attacks, including model extraction, membership inference, and model inversion. Our study reveals that adversaries can launch a variety of model-related attacks against both image and text models in a data-free and black-box manner, achieving comparable performance to baseline methods that have access to the target models' training data and parameters in a white-box manner. This research serves as an important early warning to the community about the potential risks associated with generative AI-powered attacks on deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Set Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private (DP) mechanisms for representing sets of size $k$ from a large universe. Our first construction creates $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP representations with error probability of $1/(e^\epsilon + 1)$ using space at most $1.05 k \epsilon \cdot \log(e)$ bits where the time to construct a representation is $O(k \log(1/\delta))$ while decoding time is $O(\log(1/\delta))$. We also present a second algorithm for pure $\epsilon$-DP representations with the same error using space at most $k \epsilon \cdot \log(e)$ bits, but requiring large decoding times. Our algorithms match our lower bounds on privacy-utility trade-offs (including constants but ignoring $\delta$ factors) and we also present a new space lower bound matching our constructions up to small constant factors. To obtain our results, we design a new approach embedding sets into random linear systems deviating from most prior approaches that inject noise into non-private solutions.</description>

      <title>Blockchain Address Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many blockchains, e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the primary representation used for wallet addresses is a hardly memorable 40-digit hexadecimal string. As a result, users often select addresses from their recent transaction history, which enables blockchain address poisoning. The adversary first generates lookalike addresses similar to one with which the victim has previously interacted, and then engages with the victim to ``poison'' their transaction history. The goal is to have the victim mistakenly send tokens to the lookalike address, as opposed to the intended recipient. Compared to contemporary studies, this paper provides four notable contributions. First, we develop a detection system and perform measurements over two years on Ethereum and BSC. We identify 13 times the number of attack attempts reported previously -- totaling 270M on-chain attacks targeting 17M victims. 6,633 incidents have caused at least 83.8M USD in losses, which makes blockchain address poisoning one of the largest cryptocurrency phishing schemes observed in the wild. Second, we analyze a few large attack entities using improved clustering techniques, and model attacker profitability and competition. Third, we reveal attack strategies -- targeted populations, success conditions (address similarity, timing), and cross-chain attacks. Fourth, we mathematically define and simulate the lookalike address-generation process across various software- and hardware-based implementations, and identify a large-scale attacker group that appears to use GPUs. We also discuss defensive countermeasures.</description>

      <title>HateBench: Benchmarking Hate Speech Detectors on LLM-Generated Content and Hate Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised increasing concerns about their misuse in generating hate speech. Among all the efforts to address this issue, hate speech detectors play a crucial role. However, the effectiveness of different detectors against LLM-generated hate speech remains largely unknown. In this paper, we propose HateBench, a framework for benchmarking hate speech detectors on LLM-generated hate speech. We first construct a hate speech dataset of 7,838 samples generated by six widely-used LLMs covering 34 identity groups, with meticulous annotations by three labelers. We then assess the effectiveness of eight representative hate speech detectors on the LLM-generated dataset. Our results show that while detectors are generally effective in identifying LLM-generated hate speech, their performance degrades with newer versions of LLMs. We also reveal the potential of LLM-driven hate campaigns, a new threat that LLMs bring to the field of hate speech detection. By leveraging advanced techniques like adversarial attacks and model stealing attacks, the adversary can intentionally evade the detector and automate hate campaigns online. The most potent adversarial attack achieves an attack success rate of 0.966, and its attack efficiency can be further improved by $13-21\times$ through model stealing attacks with acceptable attack performance. We hope our study can serve as a call to action for the research community and platform moderators to fortify defenses against these emerging threats.</description>

      <title>PTSA: Utilizing Transaction Prioritization to Enhance Confirmation Speed in the IOTA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of blockchain technology, a significant trend is the adoption of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as an alternative to traditional chain-based architectures for organizing ledger records. Systems like IOTA, which are specially designed for the Internet of Things (IoT), leverage DAG-based architectures to achieve greater scalability by enabling multiple attachment points in the ledger for new transactions while allowing these transactions to be added to the network without incurring any fees. To determine these attachment points, many tip selection algorithms commonly employ specific strategies on the DAG ledger. Transaction prioritization is not considered in the IOTA network, which becomes especially important when network bandwidth is limited. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework designed to integrate a priority level for critical or high-priority IoT transactions within the IOTA network. We evaluate our system using fully based on the official IOTA GitHub repository, which employs the currently operational IOTA node software (Hornet version), as part of the Chrysalis update (1.5). The experimental results show that higher-priority transactions in the proposed algorithm reach final confirmation in less time compared to the original IOTA system.</description>

      <title>TORCHLIGHT: Shedding LIGHT on Real-World Attacks on Cloudless IoT Devices Concealed within the Tor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT) landscape is shifting toward cloudless architectures, removing reliance on centralized cloud services but exposing devices directly to the internet and increasing their vulnerability to cyberattacks. Our research revealed an unexpected pattern of substantial Tor network traffic targeting cloudless IoT devices. suggesting that attackers are using Tor to anonymously exploit undisclosed vulnerabilities (possibly obtained from underground markets). To delve deeper into this phenomenon, we developed TORCHLIGHT, a tool designed to detect both known and unknown threats targeting cloudless IoT devices by analyzing Tor traffic. TORCHLIGHT filters traffic via specific IP patterns, strategically deploys virtual private server (VPS) nodes for cost-effective detection, and uses a chain-of-thought (CoT) process with large language models (LLMs) for accurate threat identification.
  Our results are significant: for the first time, we have demonstrated that attackers are indeed using Tor to conceal their identities while targeting cloudless IoT devices. Over a period of 12 months, TORCHLIGHT analyzed 26 TB of traffic, revealing 45 vulnerabilities, including 29 zero-day exploits with 25 CVE-IDs assigned (5 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 16 MEDIUM, and 1 LOW) and an estimated value of approximately $312,000. These vulnerabilities affect around 12.71 million devices across 148 countries, exposing them to severe risks such as information disclosure, authentication bypass, and arbitrary command execution. The findings have attracted significant attention, sparking widespread discussion in cybersecurity circles, reaching the top 25 on Hacker News, and generating over 190,000 views.</description>

      <title>Bones of Contention: Exploring Query-Efficient Attacks Against Skeleton Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeleton action recognition models have secured more attention than video-based ones in various applications due to privacy preservation and lower storage requirements. Skeleton data are typically transmitted to cloud servers for action recognition, with results returned to clients via Apps/APIs. However, the vulnerability of skeletal models against adversarial perturbations gradually reveals the unreliability of these systems. Existing black-box attacks all operate in a decision-based manner, resulting in numerous queries that hinder efficiency and feasibility in real-world applications. Moreover, all attacks off the shelf focus on only restricted perturbations, while ignoring model weaknesses when encountered with non-semantic perturbations. In this paper, we propose two query-effIcient Skeletal Adversarial AttaCks, ISAAC-K and ISAAC-N. As a black-box attack, ISAAC-K utilizes Grad-CAM in a surrogate model to extract key joints where minor sparse perturbations are then added to fool the classifier. To guarantee natural adversarial motions, we introduce constraints of both bone length and temporal consistency. ISAAC-K finds stronger adversarial examples on $\ell_\infty$ norm, which can encompass those on other norms. Exhaustive experiments substantiate that ISAAC-K can uplift the attack efficiency of the perturbations under 10 skeletal models. Additionally, as a byproduct, ISAAC-N fools the classifier by replacing skeletons unrelated to the action. We surprisingly find that skeletal models are vulnerable to large perturbations where the part-wise non-semantic joints are just replaced, leading to a query-free no-box attack without any prior knowledge. Based on that, four adaptive defenses are eventually proposed to improve the robustness of skeleton recognition models.</description>

      <title>Stack Overflow Meets Replication: Security Research Amid Evolving Code Snippets (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of Stack Overflow code evolution on the stability of prior research findings derived from Stack Overflow data and provide recommendations for future studies. We systematically reviewed papers published between 2005--2023 to identify key aspects of Stack Overflow that can affect study results, such as the language or context of code snippets. Our analysis reveals that certain aspects are non-stationary over time, which could lead to different conclusions if experiments are repeated at different times. We replicated six studies using a more recent dataset to demonstrate this risk. Our findings show that four papers produced significantly different results than the original findings, preventing the same conclusions from being drawn with a newer dataset version. Consequently, we recommend treating Stack Overflow as a time series data source to provide context for interpreting cross-sectional research conclusions.</description>

      <title>UEFI Memory Forensics: A Framework for UEFI Threat Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern computing systems rely on the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), which has replaced the traditional BIOS as the firmware standard for the modern boot process. Despite the advancements, UEFI is increasingly targeted by threat actors seeking to exploit its execution environment and take advantage of its persistence mechanisms. While some security-related analysis of UEFI components has been performed--primarily via debugging and runtime behavior testing--to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has specifically addressed capturing and analyzing volatile UEFI runtime memory to detect malicious exploitation during the pre-OS phase. This gap in UEFI forensic tools limits the ability to conduct in-depth security analyses in pre-OS environments. Such a gap is especially surprising, given that memory forensics is widely regarded as foundational to modern incident response, reflected by the popularity of above-OS memory analysis frameworks, such as Rekall, Volatility, and MemProcFS. To address the lack of below-OS memory forensics, we introduce a framework for UEFI memory forensics. The proposed framework consists of two primary components: UefiMemDump, a memory acquisition tool, and UEFIDumpAnalysis, an extendable collection of analysis modules capable of detecting malicious activities such as function pointer hooking, inline hooking, and malicious image loading. Our proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates our framework's ability to detect modern UEFI threats, such as ThunderStrike, CosmicStrand, and Glupteba bootkits. By providing an open-source solution, our work enables researchers and practitioners to investigate firmware-level threats, develop additional analysis modules, and advance overall below-OS security through UEFI memory analysis.</description>

      <title>Context is Key in Agent Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Judging the safety of an action, whether taken by a human or a system, must take into account the context in which the action takes place. Deleting an email from user's mailbox may or may not be appropriate depending on email's content, user's goals, or even available space. Systems today that make these judgements -- providing security against harmful or inappropriate actions -- rely on manually-crafted policies or user confirmation for each relevant context. With the upcoming deployment of systems like generalist agents, we argue that we must rethink security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain of agents and proposes contextual security for agents (Conseca), a framework to generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.</description>

      <title>CRSet: Non-Interactive Verifiable Credential Revocation with Metadata Privacy for Issuers and Everyone Else</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like any digital certificate, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) require a way to revoke them in case of an error or key compromise. Existing solutions for VC revocation, most prominently Bitstring Status List, are not viable for many use cases since they leak the issuer's behavior, which in turn leaks internal business metrics. For instance, exact staff fluctuation through issuance and revocation of employee IDs. We introduce CRSet, a revocation mechanism that allows an issuer to encode revocation information for years worth of VCs as a Bloom filter cascade. Padding is used to provide deniability for issuer metrics. Issuers periodically publish this filter cascade on a decentralized storage system. Relying Parties (RPs) can download it to perform any number of revocation checks locally. Compared to existing solutions, CRSet protects the metadata of subject, RPs, and issuer equally. At the same time, it is non-interactive, making it work with wallet devices having limited hardware power and drop-in compatible with existing VC exchange protocols and wallet applications. We present a prototype using the Ethereum blockchain as decentralized storage. The recently introduced blob-carrying transactions, enabling cheaper data writes, allow us to write each CRSet directly to the chain. We built software for issuers and RPs that we successfully tested end-to-end with an existing publicly available wallet agents and the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials protocols. Storage and bandwidth costs paid by issuers and RP are higher than for Bitstring Status List, but still manageable at around 1 MB for an issuer issuing hundreds of thousands of VCs annually and covering decades.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Multiple Cache Side Channel Attacks Detection: A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cache side channel attacks are a sophisticated and persistent threat that exploit vulnerabilities in modern processors to extract sensitive information. These attacks leverage weaknesses in shared computational resources, particularly the last level cache, to infer patterns in data access and execution flows, often bypassing traditional security defenses. Such attacks are especially dangerous as they can be executed remotely without requiring physical access to the victim's device. This study focuses on a specific class of these threats: fingerprinting attacks, where an adversary monitors and analyzes the behavior of co-located processes via cache side channels. This can potentially reveal confidential information, such as encryption keys or user activity patterns. A comprehensive threat model illustrates how attackers sharing computational resources with target systems exploit these side channels to compromise sensitive data. To mitigate such risks, a hybrid deep learning model is proposed for detecting cache side channel attacks. Its performance is compared with five widely used deep learning models: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Simple Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Gated Recurrent Unit. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves a detection rate of up to 99.96%. These findings highlight the limitations of existing models, the need for enhanced defensive mechanisms, and directions for future research to secure sensitive data against evolving side channel threats.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Embeddings for Robust Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) is a crucial aspect of realizing trustworthy AI systems. Although alignment methods aim to suppress harmful content generation, LLMs are often still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that employ adversarial inputs that subvert alignment and induce harmful outputs. We propose the Randomized Embedding Smoothing and Token Aggregation (RESTA) defense, which adds random noise to the embedding vectors and performs aggregation during the generation of each output token, with the aim of better preserving semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness versus utility tradeoffs compared to the baseline defenses.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Zero Day Attack Detection Using MLP and XAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any exploit taking advantage of zero-day is called a zero-day attack. Previous research and social media trends show a massive demand for research in zero-day attack detection. This paper analyzes Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based approaches to create Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and scrutinizing them using Explainable AI (XAI) by training an explainer based on randomly sampled data from the testing set. The focus is on using the KDD99 dataset, which has the most research done among all the datasets for detecting zero-day attacks. The paper aims to synthesize the dataset to have fewer classes for multi-class classification, test ML and DL approaches on pattern recognition, establish the robustness and dependability of the model, and establish the interpretability and scalability of the model. We evaluated the performance of four multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on the KDD99 dataset, including baseline ML models, weighted ML models, truncated ML models, and weighted truncated ML models. Our results demonstrate that the truncated ML model achieves the highest accuracy (99.62%), precision, and recall, while weighted truncated ML model shows lower accuracy (97.26%) but better class representation (less bias) among all the classes with improved unweighted recall score. We also used Shapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to train explainer for our truncated models to check for feature importance among the two weighted and unweighted models.</description>

      <title>DFCon: Attention-Driven Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents our approach for the IEEE SP Cup 2025: Deepfake Face Detection in the Wild (DFWild-Cup), focusing on detecting deepfakes across diverse datasets. Our methodology employs advanced backbone models, including MaxViT, CoAtNet, and EVA-02, fine-tuned using supervised contrastive loss to enhance feature separation. These models were specifically chosen for their complementary strengths. Integration of convolution layers and strided attention in MaxViT is well-suited for detecting local features. In contrast, hybrid use of convolution and attention mechanisms in CoAtNet effectively captures multi-scale features. Robust pretraining with masked image modeling of EVA-02 excels at capturing global features. After training, we freeze the parameters of these models and train the classification heads. Finally, a majority voting ensemble is employed to combine the predictions from these models, improving robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. The proposed system addresses the challenges of detecting deepfakes in real-world conditions and achieves a commendable accuracy of 95.83% on the validation dataset.</description>

      <title>Secure Federated Graph-Filtering for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems often rely on graph-based filters, such as normalized item-item adjacency matrices and low-pass filters. While effective, the centralized computation of these components raises concerns about privacy, security, and the ethical use of user data. This work proposes two decentralized frameworks for securely computing these critical graph components without centralizing sensitive information. The first approach leverages lightweight Multi-Party Computation and distributed singular vector computations to privately compute key graph filters. The second extends this framework by incorporating low-rank approximations, enabling a trade-off between communication efficiency and predictive performance. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve comparable accuracy to centralized state-of-the-art systems while ensuring data confidentiality and maintaining low communication costs. Our results highlight the potential for privacy-preserving decentralized architectures to bridge the gap between utility and user data protection in modern recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Few Edges Are Enough: Few-Shot Network Attack Detection with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting cyberattacks using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has seen promising results recently. Most of the state-of-the-art models that leverage these techniques require labeled examples, hard to obtain in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, unsupervised learning and Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have emerged as interesting approaches to reduce the dependency on labeled data. Nonetheless, these methods tend to yield more anomalous detection algorithms rather than effective attack detection systems. This paper introduces Few Edges Are Enough (FEAE), a GNN-based architecture trained with SSL and Few-Shot Learning (FSL) to better distinguish between false positive anomalies and actual attacks. To maximize the potential of few-shot examples, our model employs a hybrid self-supervised objective that combines the advantages of contrastive-based and reconstruction-based SSL. By leveraging only a minimal number of labeled attack events, represented as attack edges, FEAE achieves competitive performance on two well-known network datasets compared to both supervised and unsupervised methods. Remarkably, our experimental results unveil that employing only 1 malicious event for each attack type in the dataset is sufficient to achieve substantial improvements. FEAE not only outperforms self-supervised GNN baselines but also surpasses some supervised approaches on one of the datasets.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the problem of Oblivious Transfer (OT) over a noisy Multiple Access Channel (MAC) involving two non-colluding senders and a single receiver. The channel model is characterized by correlations among the parties, with the parties assumed to be either honest-but-curious or, in the receiver's case, potentially malicious. We propose a multiparty protocol for honest-but-curious parties where the general MAC is reduced to a certain correlation. In scenarios where the receiver is malicious, the protocol achieves an achievable rate region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, alignment, and task-specific performance. However, ensuring harmlessness in these systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in advanced models like DeepSeek-R1. This paper examines the limitations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the primary approach for reducing harmful outputs in DeepSeek-R1 and compares it with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While RL improves reasoning capabilities, it faces challenges such as reward hacking, generalization failures, language mixing, and high computational costs. We propose hybrid training approaches combining RL and SFT to achieve robust harmlessness reduction. Usage recommendations and future directions for deploying DeepSeek-R1 responsibly are also presented.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Capacity of Byzantine Symmetric Private Information Retrieval and Its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the asymptotic capacity of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) with $B$ Byzantine servers. Prior to finding the capacity, a definition for the Byzantine servers is needed since in the literature there are two different definitions. In \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where it was first defined, the Byzantine servers can send any symbol from the storage, their received queries and some independent random symbols. In \cite{unresponsive_byzantine_1}, Byzantine servers send any random symbol independently of their storage and queries. It is clear that these definitions are not identical, especially when \emph{symmetric} privacy is required. To that end, we define Byzantine servers, inspired by \cite{byzantine_tpir}, as the servers that can share everything, before and after the scheme initiation. In this setting, we find an upper bound, for an infinite number of messages case, that should be satisfied for all schemes that protect against this setting and develop a scheme that achieves this upper bound. Hence, we identify the capacity of the problem.</description>

      <title>From Prompt Injections to SQL Injection Attacks: How Protected is Your LLM-Integrated Web Application?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have found widespread applications in various domains, including web applications, where they facilitate human interaction via chatbots with natural language interfaces. Internally, aided by an LLM-integration middleware such as Langchain, user prompts are translated into SQL queries used by the LLM to provide meaningful responses to users. However, unsanitized user prompts can lead to SQL injection attacks, potentially compromising the security of the database. Despite the growing interest in prompt injection vulnerabilities targeting LLMs, the specific risks of generating SQL injection attacks through prompt injections have not been extensively studied. In this paper, we present a comprehensive examination of prompt-to-SQL (P$_2$SQL) injections targeting web applications based on the Langchain framework. Using Langchain as our case study, we characterize P$_2$SQL injections, exploring their variants and impact on application security through multiple concrete examples. Furthermore, we evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating the pervasiveness of P$_2$SQL attacks across language models. Our findings indicate that LLM-integrated applications based on Langchain are highly susceptible to P$_2$SQL injection attacks, warranting the adoption of robust defenses. To counter these attacks, we propose four effective defense techniques that can be integrated as extensions to the Langchain framework. We validate the defenses through an experimental evaluation with a real-world use case application.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Multi-bit Watermarking for AI-generated Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16820v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities of generating texts resembling human language. However, they can be misused by criminals to create deceptive content, such as fake news and phishing emails, which raises ethical concerns. Watermarking is a key technique to address these concerns, which embeds a message (e.g., a bit string) into a text generated by an LLM. By embedding the user ID (represented as a bit string) into generated texts, we can trace generated texts to the user, known as content source tracing. The major limitation of existing watermarking techniques is that they achieve sub-optimal performance for content source tracing in real-world scenarios. The reason is that they cannot accurately or efficiently extract a long message from a generated text. We aim to address the limitations.
  In this work, we introduce a new watermarking method for LLM-generated text grounded in pseudo-random segment assignment. We also propose multiple techniques to further enhance the robustness of our watermarking algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method. Our experimental results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and robustness on benchmark datasets. For instance, when embedding a message of length 20 into a 200-token generated text, our method achieves a match rate of $97.6\%$, while the state-of-the-art work Yoo et al. only achieves $49.2\%$. Additionally, we prove that our watermark can tolerate edits within an edit distance of 17 on average for each paragraph under the same setting.</description>

      <title>Self-interpreting Adversarial Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of indirect, cross-modal injection attacks against visual language models that enable creation of self-interpreting images. These images contain hidden "meta-instructions" that control how models answer users' questions about the image and steer their outputs to express an adversary-chosen style, sentiment, or point of view. Self-interpreting images act as soft prompts, conditioning the model to satisfy the adversary's (meta-)objective while still producing answers based on the image's visual content. Meta-instructions are thus a stronger form of prompt injection. Adversarial images look natural and the model's answers are coherent and plausible--yet they also follow the adversary-chosen interpretation, e.g., political spin, or even objectives that are not achievable with explicit text instructions. We evaluate the efficacy of self-interpreting images for a variety of models, interpretations, and user prompts. We describe how these attacks could cause harm by enabling creation of self-interpreting content that carries spam, misinformation, or spin. Finally, we discuss defenses.</description>

      <title>Measuring NIST Authentication Standards Compliance by Higher Education Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technical standards are a longstanding method of communicating best practice recommendations based on expert consensus. Cybersecurity standards are particularly important for informing practices that protect critical systems and sensitive data. Measuring standards compliance is therefore essential to identify vulnerabilities arising from continued use of outdated practices and to determine whether expert advice has effectively diffused to practitioners. In this paper, we examine the authentication practices of a diverse set of 136 colleges and universities in the United States and Canada to determine compliance with four standards from NIST Special Publication 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines. These standards have been in place since 2017, pose a relatively low barrier to implementation, yet are substantive revisions from pre-2017 versions, making them an excellent case study for measuring the responsiveness of institutions to updated expert guidance. We find widespread, but not universal, compliance with multi-factor authentication (MFA) standards across institutions. We also find widespread noncompliance with standards for password expiration, password composition rules, and knowledge-based authentication. These results are a wake-up call that many expert cybersecurity recommendations are not effectively reaching practitioners, suggesting a need for alternative outreach strategies, increased investment in education and training initiatives, and an examination of incentive structures that result in noncompliant and insecure practices.</description>

      <title>Can Watermarked LLMs be Identified by Users via Crafted Prompts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text watermarking for Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant progress in detecting LLM outputs and preventing misuse. Current watermarking techniques offer high detectability, minimal impact on text quality, and robustness to text editing. However, current researches lack investigation into the imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLM services. This is crucial as LLM providers may not want to disclose the presence of watermarks in real-world scenarios, as it could reduce user willingness to use the service and make watermarks more vulnerable to attacks. This work is the first to investigate the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs. We design an identification algorithm called Water-Probe that detects watermarks through well-designed prompts to the LLM. Our key motivation is that current watermarked LLMs expose consistent biases under the same watermark key, resulting in similar differences across prompts under different watermark keys. Experiments show that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms are easily identified with our well-designed prompts, while Water-Probe demonstrates a minimal false positive rate for non-watermarked LLMs. Finally, we propose that the key to enhancing the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs is to increase the randomness of watermark key selection. Based on this, we introduce the Water-Bag strategy, which significantly improves watermark imperceptibility by merging multiple watermark keys.</description>

      <title>PAPILLON: Privacy Preservation from Internet-based and Local Language Model Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Users can divulge sensitive information to proprietary LLM providers, raising significant privacy concerns. While open-source models, hosted locally on the user's machine, alleviate some concerns, models that users can host locally are often less capable than proprietary frontier models. Toward preserving user privacy while retaining the best quality, we propose Privacy-Conscious Delegation, a novel task for chaining API-based and local models. We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%. We still leave a large margin to the generation quality of proprietary LLMs for future work. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/PAPILLON.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents enhanced reductions of the bounded-weight and exact-weight Syndrome Decoding Problem (SDP) to a system of quadratic equations. Over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we improve on a previous work and study the degree of regularity of the modeling of the exact weight SDP. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique that transforms SDP instances over $\mathbb{F}_q$ into systems of polynomial equations and thoroughly investigate the dimension of their varieties. Experimental results are provided to evaluate the complexity of solving SDP instances using our models through Gr\"obner bases techniques.</description>

      <title>Cyber Shadows: Neutralizing Security Threats with AI and Targeted Policy Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The digital age, driven by the AI revolution, brings significant opportunities but also conceals security threats, which we refer to as cyber shadows. These threats pose risks at individual, organizational, and societal levels. This paper examines the systemic impact of these cyber threats and proposes a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that integrates AI-driven solutions, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), with targeted policy interventions. By combining technological and regulatory measures, we create a multilevel defense capable of addressing both direct threats and indirect negative externalities. We emphasize that the synergy between AI-driven solutions and policy interventions is essential for neutralizing cyber threats and mitigating their negative impact on the digital economy. Finally, we underscore the need for continuous adaptation of these strategies, especially in response to the rapid advancement of autonomous AI-driven attacks, to ensure the creation of secure and resilient digital ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection With Local Temporal Inconsistencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.</description>

      <title>PCAP-Backdoor: Backdoor Poisoning Generator for Network Traffic in CPS/IoT Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of connected devices has made them prime targets for cyberattacks. To address these threats, deep learning-based, data-driven intrusion detection systems (IDS) have emerged as powerful tools for detecting and mitigating such attacks. These IDSs analyze network traffic to identify unusual patterns and anomalies that may indicate potential security breaches. However, prior research has shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers inject triggers into the model to manipulate its behavior and cause misclassifications of network traffic. In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of deep learning-based IDS systems to backdoor attacks in the context of network traffic analysis. We introduce \texttt{PCAP-Backdoor}, a novel technique that facilitates backdoor poisoning attacks on PCAP datasets. Our experiments on real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic datasets demonstrate that attackers can effectively backdoor a model by poisoning as little as 1\% or less of the entire training dataset. Moreover, we show that an attacker can introduce a trigger into benign traffic during model training yet cause the backdoored model to misclassify malicious traffic when the trigger is present. Finally, we highlight the difficulty of detecting this trigger-based backdoor, even when using existing backdoor defense techniques.</description>
