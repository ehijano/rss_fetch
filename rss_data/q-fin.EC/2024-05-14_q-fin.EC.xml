      <title>Breaking open the black box of the production function: an agent-based model accounting for time in production processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional notions of production function do not consider the time dimension, appearing thus timeless and instantaneous. We propose an agent-based model accounting for the whole production side of the economy to unfold the production process from its very beginning, when firms receive production orders, to the delivery of the products to the market. In the model we analyze with a high-degree of details how heterogeneous firms, having labor and capital as productive factors, behave along all the realization processes of their outputs. The main focus covers: i) the heterogeneous duration of firms' production processes, ii) the adaptive strategies they implement to adjust their choices, and iii) the possible failures which may occur due to the duration of the production. Our agent-based model is a controlled experiment: we use a virtual central planner mechanism, which acts as the demand side of the economy, to observe which firm individual behaviors and aggregate macroeconomic outcomes emerge as a reply to its different behaviors in a ceteris paribus environment. Our applied goal, then, is to discuss the role of industrial policy by modeling production processes in detail.</description>

      <title>Fight like a Woman: Domestic Violence and Female Judges in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the impact of judges' gender on the outcome of domestic violence cases. Using data From S\~ao Paulo, Brazil, between 2010 and 2019, we compare conviction rates by judge's gender and find that a domestic violence case assigned to a female judge is 31% (10 p.p) more likely to result in conviction than a case assigned to a male judge with similar career characteristics. To show that this decision gap rises due to different gender perspectives about domestic violence instead of rising due to female judges being tougher than male judges, we compare it against gender conviction rate gaps in similar types of crimes. We find that the gender conviction rate gap for domestic violence cases is significantly larger than the same gap for other misdemeanor cases (3 p.p. larger) and for other physical assault cases (8 p.p. larger). Lastly, we find evidence that at least two channels explain this gender conviction rate gap for domestic violence cases: gender-based differences in evidence interpretation and gender-based sentencing criteria.</description>

      <title>China's plug-in hybrid electric vehicles transition: an operational carbon perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the energy and emissions of representative plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) model operations is crucial for accelerating carbon neutrality transitions in China's passenger car sector. This study makes the first attempt to create a bottom-up model to measure the real-world energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of China's top twenty selling PHEV model operations across different geographical regions during 2020-2022. The results indicate that (1) the actual electricity intensity for the best-selling PEHV models (20.2-38.2 kilowatt-hour [kWh]/100 kilometers [km]) was 30-40% higher than the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) values, and the actual gasoline intensity (4.7 to 23.5 liters [L]/100 km) was 3-6 times greater than the NEDC values. (2) The overall energy consumption of the best-selling models exhibited variations among various geographical regions, and the total gasoline equivalent was twice as high in southern China (1283 mega-liters, 2020-2022) than in northern China and the Yangtze River Middle Reach. (3) The top-selling models emitted 4.9 mega-tons (Mt) of CO2 nationwide from 2020-2022, 1.9 Mt from electricity and 3 Mt from gasoline. In northern China, carbon emissions per vehicle were more than 1.2 times greater than those in other regions. Furthermore, targeted policy implications for expediting the carbon-neutral transition within the passenger vehicles are proposed. Overall, this study reviews and compares national and regional benchmark data and performance data for PHEV operations. Its objective is to bolster national decarbonization initiatives, ensuring low emissions and expediting the transportation sector's transition toward a net-zero era.</description>

      <title>Computational analysis of US Congressional speeches reveals a shift from evidence to intuition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pursuit of honest and truthful decision-making is crucial for governance and accountability in democracies. However, people sometimes take different perspectives of what it means to be honest and how to pursue truthfulness. Here we explore a continuum of perspectives from evidence-based reasoning, rooted in ascertainable facts and data, at one end, to intuitive decisions that are driven by feelings and subjective interpretations, at the other. We analyze the linguistic traces of those contrasting perspectives in Congressional speeches from 1879 to 2022. We find that evidence-based language has continued to decline since the mid-1970s, together with a decline in legislative productivity. The decline was accompanied by increasing partisan polarization in Congress and rising income inequality in society. Results highlight the importance of evidence-based language in political decision-making.</description>

      <title>Packing Peanuts: The Role Synthetic Data Can Play in Enhancing Conventional Economic Prediction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Packing peanuts, as defined by Wikipedia, is a common loose-fill packaging and cushioning material that helps prevent damage to fragile items. In this paper, I propose that synthetic data, akin to packing peanuts, can serve as a valuable asset for economic prediction models, enhancing their performance and robustness when integrated with real data. This hybrid approach proves particularly beneficial in scenarios where data is either missing or limited in availability. Through the utilization of Affinity credit card spending and Womply small business datasets, this study demonstrates the substantial performance improvements achieved by employing a hybrid data approach, surpassing the capabilities of traditional economic modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Colocation of skill related suppliers -- Revisiting coagglomeration using firm-to-firm network data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong local clusters help firms compete on global markets. One explanation for this is that firms benefit from locating close to their suppliers and customers. However, the emergence of global supply chains shows that physical proximity is not necessarily a prerequisite to successfully manage customer-supplier relations anymore. This raises the question when firms need to colocate in value chains and when they can coordinate over longer distances. We hypothesize that one important aspect is the extent to which supply chain partners exchange not just goods but also know-how. To test this, we build on an expanding literature that studies the drivers of industrial coagglomeration to analyze when supply chain connections lead firms to colocation. We exploit detailed micro-data for the Hungarian economy between 2015 and 2017, linking firm registries, employer-employee matched data and firm-to-firm transaction data from value-added tax records. This allows us to observe colocation, labor flows and value chain connections at the level of firms, as well as construct aggregated coagglomeration patterns, skill relatedness and input-output connections between pairs of industries. We show that supply chains are more likely to support coagglomeration when the industries involved are also skill related. That is, input-output and labor market channels reinforce each other, but supplier connections only matter for colocation when industries have similar labor requirements, suggesting that they employ similar types of know-how. We corroborate this finding by analyzing the interactions between firms, showing that supplier relations are more geographically constrained between companies that operate in skill related industries.</description>

      <title>The Power of Non-Superpowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10206v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a game-theoretic model to investigate how non-superpowers with heterogenous preferences and endowments shape the superpower competition for a sphere of influence. Two superpowers play a Stackelberg game by providing club goods. Their utility depends on non-superpowers who form coalitions to join a club in the presence of externality. The coalition formation, which depends on the characteristics of non-superpowers, influences the behavior of superpowers and thus the size of their clubs. Our data-based simulations of the subgame perfect equilbirum capture how the US-China competition depends on other countries.</description>

      <title>Health Impacts of Public Pawnshops in Industrializing Tokyo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is the first to investigate whether pawnshops, financial institutions for low-income populations, have contributed to the decline in mortality in the early twentieth century. Using ward-level panel data from Tokyo City, this study revealed that the popularity of public pawnshops was associated with a 4% and 5% decrease in infant mortality and fetal death rates, respectively, during 1927-1935. The historical context implies that the potential channels of the relationships were improving nutrition and hygiene and covering childbirth costs. Moreover, a cost-benefit calculation highlighted that the establishment of public pawnshops was a cost-effective public investment for better public health. Contrarily, for-profit private pawnshops showed no significant association with health improvements.</description>

      <title>Contagion Effects of the Silicon Valley Bank Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the contagion effects associated with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and identifies bank-specific vulnerabilities contributing to the subsequent declines in banks' stock returns. We find that uninsured deposits, unrealized losses in held-to-maturity securities, bank size, and cash holdings had a significant impact, while better-quality assets or holdings of liquid securities did not help mitigate the negative spillovers. Interestingly, banks whose stocks performed worse post-SVB also experienced lower returns in the previous year, following Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. Stock investors appeared to anticipate risks associated with uninsured deposit reliance, but did not foresee the realization of implied losses. While mid-sized banks experienced particular stress immediately after the SVB failure, over time negative spillovers became widespread except for the largest banks.</description>
