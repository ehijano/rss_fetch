      <title>Extended Relativity: Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their success, General Relativity (GR) and the Standard Model (SM) are currently understood as effective field theories only valid up to some energy (length) scale, where new physics is expected to appear. We review the framework of extended relativity (ER) in Clifford spaces (C-spaces), summarising some of its concepts, methods and results. We also discuss likely links of this approach with other relativies (OR), beyond GR and SM theories, recent ideas from emergent spacetime (ES) and quantum entanglement (QE), in search for quantum gravity (QG) and unification (U). Finally, we explore and expose the need to go even beyond ER, and the challenges it poses, from both experimental and theoretical sides.</description>

      <title>Spacetime with prescribed hidden symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate spacetime characterized by a hidden symmetry defined by a given Killing tensor. To exhibit this hidden symmetry, the inverse metric must commute with the Killing tensor under the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, which translates into a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) for the inverse metric. For some significant examples, we solve these PDEs directly, deriving spacetimes with prescribed hidden symmetries, including those specified by higher-rank Killing tensors. Utilizing the hidden symmetries, we study related problems such as null geodesics, photon region, and separation of variables of wave equations. Through this work, we aim to demonstrate that hidden symmetry is more accessible than previously believed.</description>

      <title>Tides and traversability in gravastars and other related geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal effects related to the traversability across thin shells are examined in spherically symmetric geometries. We focus mainly on shells separating inner from outer regions of gravastars (de Sitter -- i.e., $\Lambda&gt;0$ -- interior and Schwarzschild exterior of mass parameter $M$), but we also examine other related geometries by including the possibility of a negative cosmological constant and, besides, non trivial topologies where the shell separates two outer regions. The analysis is developed for radially traversing objects and for tides in both radial and transverse directions, which present difficulties of somewhat different nature. Transverse tides are unavoidable across shells which satisfy the flare-out condition, while shells in trivial topologies, i.e. geometries with one asymptotic region, are more indulgent with the issue of insurmountable tides. Besides, contradicting other cases analyzed in previous works, we find that large radial tides cannot be avoided when traveling across the shell in the gravastar solution, but in non-trivial topologies they can. We study with special attention the traversability in practice of the transition layer in the thin-shell gravastar solution. In particular, a finite object which traverses radially the shell in a gravastar with $\sqrt{\Lambda}\ll 1/M$ undergoes a compression effect in both the transverse and the radial directions due to the tides associated to the thin layer. The results are interpreted in terms of the total momentum transfer obtained by integrating the travel time of the object.</description>

      <title>Charged and Rotating Black Holes in a Melvin-swirling Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present new exact solutions of Einstein-Maxwell's field equations, with the most general case being the dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole in a Melvin-swirling universe, obtained analytically using the Ehlers-Harrison transformations of the Ernst formalism. Subsequently, for each possible sub-case, we analyze the presence of singularities and study some physical properties. Finally, we examine their supersymmetry in the context of $N=2$, $d=4$ Supergravity.</description>

      <title>Bardeen spacetime with charged scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ref. \cite{Wang:2023tdz} investigated the model of Einstein-Bardeen theory coupled to a free complex scalar field. The introduction of the scalar field prevents the formation of the event horizon, and when the magnetic charge exceeds a certain critical value, the frozen Bardeen-boson star can be obtained with the frequency $\omega \rightarrow 0$. In this paper, we extend the investigation of the Einstein-Bardeen model with a charged scalar field and obtain two types of solutions: the small $q$ solution and the large $q$ solution. Specifically, for the small $q$ solution, we find that there exists a maximum value for the charge $q$, the introduction of the charge makes it possible to obtain solutions for frozen stars without the frequency to be approached to zero. For the large $q$ solution, the charge can tend toward infinity, and as $q \rightarrow \infty$, the large $q$ solution gradually becomes the pure Bardeen solution. Similar to Ref. \cite{Wang:2023tdz}, the event horizon is not found in our results.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis in modified Galileon cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the phase space analysis in modified Galileon cosmology, where the Galileon term is considered a coupled scalar field, $F(\phi)$. We focus on the exponential type function of $F(\phi)$ and the three well-motivated potential functions $V(\phi)$. We obtain the critical points of the autonomous system, along with their stability conditions and cosmological properties. The critical points of the autonomous system describe different phases of the Universe. In the results of our analysis, we have found the scaling solution for critical points, which determine different evolutionary eras for the Universe. The dark-energy-dominated critical points show stable behavior and indicate the Universe's late-time cosmic acceleration phase. Further, the results are examined with the cosmological data sets of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ and the Supernovae Ia.</description>

      <title>Time-Machines Construct within Ricci-inverse Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our objective is to explore a time-machine space-time formulated in general relativity, as introduced by Li (Phys. Rev. D {\bf 59}, 084016 (1999)), within the context of modified gravity theories. We consider Ricci-inverse gravity of all Classes of models, {\it i.e.}, (i) Class-{\bf I}: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A})=(\mathcal{R}+\beta\,\mathcal{A})$, (ii) Class-{\bf II}: $f(\mathcal{R}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$ model, and (iii) Class-{\bf III}: $f(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})=(\mathcal{R}+\beta\,\mathcal{A}+\delta\,\mathcal{A}^2+\gamma\,A^{\mu\nu}\,A_{\mu\nu})$ model, where $A^{\mu\nu}$ is the anti-curvature tensor, the reciprocal of the Ricci tensor, $R_{\mu\nu}$, $\mathcal{A}=g_{\mu\nu}\,A^{\mu\nu}$ is its scalar, and $\beta, \gamma, \delta$ are the coupling constants. In fact, we show that Li time-machine space-time serve as valid solution within this Ricci-inverse gravity theory. Thus, this new theory allows the formation of closed time-like curves analogue to general relativity, representing a possible time machine model in Ricci-inverse modified gravity theoretically.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption of Stars by Supermassive Black Holes and Naked Singularities with Scalar Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study tidal forces near strongly gravitating objects at the centers of galaxies. In our approach, dark matter surrounding the centers of galaxies is modeled by a nonlinear scalar field. We focus on static, asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric black holes and naked singularities supported by a real self-gravitating scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. We consider the influence of dark matter on the tidal forces caused by the central objects and some features of the motion of matter near these configurations. It turns out, first, that the event horizon radius of a scalar field black hole can be arbitrarily small as well as the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, and tidal forces near this orbit can be very large. Second, we show that if strongly gravitating objects in the centers of galaxies are naked singularities, then bright flares (tidal disruption events) in the nuclei of galaxies can be explained in different way. In the vicinity of a scalar field naked singularity, baryonic matter is concentrated in the gravitational potential well forming a "gray shell" consisting of cold compressed matter. In this case, the flares are caused by the collisions of stars with this shell.</description>

      <title>Casimir Effect and Gravitational Balance: a Search for Stable Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the role of the repulsive Casimir force in counteracting the gravitational contraction of a thin spherically symmetric shell. Our main focus is to explore the possibility of achieving a stable balanced configuration within the theoretically reliable weak field limit. To this end, we consider different types of Casimir forces, including those generated by massless scalar fields, massive scalar fields, electromagnetic fields, and temperature-dependent fields.</description>

      <title>When to Sweat the Small Stuff: identifying the most informative events from ground-based gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore scaling relations for the information carried by individual events, and how that information accumulates in catalogs like those from ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. For a variety of situations, the larger number of quiet/distant signals dominates the overall information over the fewer loud/close sources, independent of how many model parameters are considered. We consider implications for a range of astrophysical scenarios, including calibration uncertainty and standard siren cosmology. However, the large number of additional events obtained by lowering the detection threshold can rapidly increase costs. We introduce a simple analysis that balances the costs of analyzing increasingly large numbers of low information events against retaining a higher threshold and running a survey for longer. With the caveat that precise cost estimates are difficult to determine, current economics favor analyzing low signal-to-noise ratio events. However, the higher detection rates expected for next-generation detectors may argue for a higher signal-to-noise ratio threshold for optimal scientific return.</description>

      <title>Non-rigidly rotating stationary cylindrical dust spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stationary rotating cylindrically symmetric dust spacetimes. We first show that the Maitra spacetime is the unique non-rigidly (non null shear scalar) rotating solution with a regular axis and that is the most general one of the field equations. We are also able to demonstrate what Maitra's paper does not show, where the solution is merely stated without any demonstration. Then we find that the non-rigidly rotating spacetimes, not necessarily regular, can be matched, across timelike cylindrical hypersurfaces, to a one-parameter family of stationary vacuum exteriors given by the Weyl class but not to the Lewis class, generalizing a result by Bonnor and Steidman. Among other properties, it is shown that the amount of rotating dust packed inside a cylinder is bigger if it is rigidly rotating than non-rigidly rotating. Finally, we show that in the non-rigidly rotating cases the fluid necessarily has vorticity and the spacetimes are not silent, where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor is non-zero.</description>

      <title>Local quantum detection of cosmological expansion: Unruh-DeWitt in spatially compact Milne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the excitations and de-excitations of an inertial Unruh-DeWitt detector in the $(1+1)$-dimensional expanding Milne cosmology with compact spatial sections, coupled to a real massless scalar field with either untwisted or twisted boundary conditions, prepared in the conformal vacuum. We find the detector's response as a function of the energy gap, the Milne spatial circumference parameter, the interaction duration, the age of the universe at the switch-on moment, the detector's peculiar velocity at the switch-on moment, and, for the untwisted field, the state of the zero mode. Asymptotic analytic results are obtained at large energy gap and at large circumference parameter, in each case recovering the Minkowski vacuum response in the leading order, and in the double limit of small circumference parameter and late cosmological time, recovering the response in a static Minkowski cylinder. Numerical results are given in the interpolating regimes. The results confirm the detector's sensitivity to both classical and quantum properties of its environment.</description>

      <title>Stimulated absorption of single gravitons: First light on quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work we showed that the detection of the exchange of a single graviton between a massive quantum resonator and a gravitational wave can be achieved. Key to this ability are the experimental progress in preparing and measuring massive resonators in the quantum regime, and the correlation with independent LIGO detections of gravitational waves that induce stimulated absorption. But do stimulated single-graviton processes imply the quantization of gravity? Here we analyze this question and make a historic analogy to the early days of quantum theory. We discuss in what ways such experiments can indeed probe key features of the quantized interaction between gravity and matter, and outline five experimental tests. This capability would open the first window into experimental exploration of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions for 4-D Dyonic AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of four dimensional charged dyonic AdS black holes. By considering the changes in the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the gravitational thermodynamics of AdS black holes can be extended. This corresponds to including the central charge $C$ and its chemical potential $\mu$ to the conventional pairs of temperature vs. entropy $(T, S)$, electric potential vs. charge $(\tilde{\Phi},\tilde{Q})$, and field theory pressure vs. volume $(p,\mathcal{V})$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables in the dual CFT. Here we have dived further and introduced an extra potential and charge making it a dyonic system. So the conventional pairs for potential and charges become electric potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_e,\tilde{Q}_e)$ and magnetic potential and charge $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_m)$. In all the 16 ensembles that we examined, we found that only some have interesting phase behavior. For ensembles $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, C )$ and $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we notice a first and second order phase transition. For the ensemble $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{\Phi}_m \mathcal{V}, C )$ we see a confined/deconfined phase transition. At a temperature that depends on $\mu$, we discover a zeroth-order phase transition between a high- and low-entropy phase in the fixed $(\tilde{\Phi}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{\Phi}_m, \tilde{Q}_e \mathcal{V}, \mu )$, $(\tilde{Q}_e, \tilde{Q}_m \mathcal{V}, \mu )$. Since in our study of the parametric plots, the fixed eight $p$ ensembles exhibit no critical behavior, or $p-\mathcal{V}$ criticality, the CFT state dual to a classical charged black hole cannot be a Van der Waals fluid.</description>

      <title>Time-symmetric correlations for open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-time expectation values of sequential measurements of dichotomic observables are known to be time symmetric for closed quantum systems. Namely, if a system evolves unitarily between sequential measurements of dichotomic observables $\mathscr{O}_{A}$ followed by $\mathscr{O}_{B}$, then it necessarily follows that $\langle\mathscr{O}_{A}\,,\mathscr{O}_{B}\rangle=\langle\mathscr{O}_{B}\,,\mathscr{O}_{A}\rangle$, where $\langle\mathscr{O}_{A}\,,\mathscr{O}_{B}\rangle$ is the two-time expectation value corresponding to the product of the measurement outcomes of $\mathscr{O}_{A}$ followed by $\mathscr{O}_{B}$, and $\langle\mathscr{O}_{B}\,,\mathscr{O}_{A}\rangle$ is the two-time expectation value associated with the time reversal of the unitary dynamics, where a measurement of $\mathscr{O}_{B}$ precedes a measurement of $\mathscr{O}_{A}$. In this work, we show that a quantum Bayes' rule implies a time symmetry for two-time expectation values associated with open quantum systems, which evolve according to a general quantum channel between measurements. Such results are in contrast with the view that processes associated with open quantum systems -- which may lose information to their environment -- are not reversible in any operational sense. We give an example of such time-symmetric correlations for the amplitude-damping channel, and we propose an experimental protocol for the potential verification of the theoretical predictions associated with our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that quantizing gravity on a null hypersurface leads to the emergence of a CFT associated with each null ray. This result stems from the ultralocal nature of null physics and is derived through a canonical analysis of the Raychaudhuri equation, interpreted as a constraint generating null time reparametrizations. The CFT exhibits a non-zero central charge, providing a mechanism for the quantum emergence of time in gravitational systems and an associated choice of vacuum state. Our analysis reveals that the central charge quantifies the degrees of freedom along each null ray. Throughout our investigation, the area element of a cut plays a crucial role, necessitating its treatment as a quantum operator due to its dynamic nature in phase space or because of quantum backreaction. Furthermore, we show that the total central charge diverges in a perturbative analysis due to the infinite number of null generators. This divergence is resolved if there is a discrete spectrum for the area form operator. We introduce the concept of `embadons' to denote these localized geometric units of area, the fundamental building blocks of geometry at a mesoscopic quantum gravity scale.</description>

      <title>An efficient pipeline for joint gravitational wave searches from individual binaries and a gravitational wave background with Hamiltonian sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pulsar timing array community has recently reported the first evidence of a low-frequency stochastic gravitational wave background. With longer observational timespans we expect to be able to resolve individual gravitational wave sources in our data alongside the background signal. The statistical modeling and Bayesian searches for such individual signals is a computationally taxing task that is the focus of many different avenues of methods development. We present a pipeline for performing efficient joint searches for gravitational waves originating from individual supermassive black hole binaries as well as a gravitational wave background using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling scheme. Hamiltonian sampling proposes samples based on the gradients of the model likelihood, and can both converge faster to more complicated and high-dimensional distributions as well as efficiently explore highly covariant parameter spaces such as the joint gravitational wave background and individual binary model. We show the effectiveness of our scheme by demonstrating accurate parameter estimation for simulated datasets containing low- (6 nHz) or high- (60 nHz) frequency binary sources. Additionally we show that our method is capable at more efficiently generating skymaps for individual binary sources -- maps displaying the upper limits on the gravitational wave strain of the source, $h_{0}$, as a function of sky location -- by sampling over larger portions of the full sky. Comparing against results for the NANOGrav 12.5-year dataset, we find similar reconstructed upper limits on the gravitational wave strain while simultaneously reducing the number of required analyses from 72 independent binned searches down to a single run.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a subclass of Horndeski gravity which has both global conformal and shift symmetries. Global symmetries are characterised by the presence of a conserved current which has been shown to be of particular importance for the integrability features of the theory at hand yielding numerous compact object solutions. We find the general conserved current associated to global conformal symmetry of Horndeski theories. We discuss some of its properties, how it can be conveniently broken by physically relevant terms and, show how it is related to that of shift symmetry when shift symmetry is present. Given our results, we consider a particular theory and demonstrate how the presence of symmetries provides integrability for the given black hole solution. We then find the charged extension of the solution thanks to the conformal invariance of the Maxwell action.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of the false vacuum in the regime where the quantum field theory analysis is not valid, since gravitational effects become important. This happens when the height of the barrier separating the false and the true vacuum is large, and it has implications for the instability of de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua. We carry out the calculations for a scalar field with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall approximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the bubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of the height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared to the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable despite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative depth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on the potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the probability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent data seem to suggest a preference for the evolving dark energy (DE). However, if the case is actually so, and not caused by unknown systematics in data, it might impact our understanding about our Universe in an anomalous way due to the shifts of some primary parameters. As an example, we present the search for the primordial gravitational waves, based on the evolving DE. The joint analysis of recent BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization data with Planck18 CMB, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and PantheonPlus data shows that the bestfit tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}\sim 0.01$, and the lower bound of $r_{0.05}$ is $\sim 2\sigma$ non-zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the detection accuracy of double white dwarfs (DWDs), stellar-mass black hole binaries (SBHBs), light and heavy intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs), extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) of astronomical origin for TianQin, LISA, and joint detection. We use a Fisher matrix analysis and consider for each source the averaged detection accuracy over a realistic range of parameters. We find that on average TianQin obtains more accurate parameter estimation for DWDs and light IMRIs, LISA for heavy IMRIs, EMRIs, MBHBs, and the galactic foreground of the SGWB, and both contribute similarly to the detection of SBHBs and the extra-galactic SGWB. Nevertheless, for all sources joint detection allows setting tighter constraints on most parameters highlighting its importance for future detection.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study black hole solutions in double field theory. In the first part, we introduce a solution-generating method and classify black hole solutions into three categories in standard double field theory. To solve the problem of double time, we utilize space/time split double field theory in the second part to derive black hole solutions. By introducing a cosmological constant and imposing the strong constraint, our findings indicate that when considering the entire doubled spacetime, the curvature signifies an AdS vacuum. However, in the subspace of the entire spacetime, black holes and curvature singularities emerge.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Cosmic Evolution of Supermassive Black Holes using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the Universe remains an open question in cosmology. We show for the first time that the evolution of SMBHs with redshift leads to a unique signature on the angular cross-correlation power spectrum between the multi-frequency nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave (SGWB) and the galaxy density in the Universe. By using galaxy catalogs from the upcoming Rubin LSST Observatory in synergy with the nHz SGWB signal accessible from the Square Kilometer Array, we can measure this signal with a signal-to-noise ratio above five, thereby opening a new observational window to the cosmic evolution of SMBHs across redshift. This discovery space that can be opened by the cross-correlation of the nHz SGWB will not be possible by any other currently known techniques.</description>

      <title>Young Black Holes Have Smooth Horizons: A Swampland Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that black hole microstates in string theory may have "no interiors". The arguments of arXiv:2312.14108 suggest that even if this were the case, conventional bulk EFT should be valid at the horizon for black holes that are not too old. Here, we explore the validity of bulk EFT for young black holes from a different perspective, by considering the gravitational collapse of scalar moduli. This builds on arXiv:2003.05488, which studied the numerical collapse of a scalar field in a Choptuik-like set up. Evidence was presented there for two observations -- (a) For every scalar profile that results in collapse, the scalar field undergoes trans-Planckian variation, (b) Every trans-Planckian scalar motion is hidden behind an apparent horizon. The results of arXiv:2003.05488 were mostly obtained in regimes close to critical collapse, where scale-separation was difficult to achieve. In this paper, we study the same system in super-critical regimes. This allows us to study the localization properties of scalar variations inside the apparent horizon by separating the horizon and singularity scales. We find strong evidence that the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ scalar variation is localized around the curvature divergence, and is hierarchically well-separated from the apparent horizon. Because $\mathcal{O}(1)$ scalar movement is associated to the breakdown of bulk EFT according to the swampland distance conjecture, this is an indication that bulk EFT is well-behaved in the interiors of young black holes. Our results suggest the perspective that cosmic censorship is a mechanism for preserving bulk EFT between the horizon and the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrollian field theories have recently emerged as a candidate dual to flat space quantum gravity. We carefully quantize simple two-derivative Carrollian theories, revealing a strong sensitivity to the ultraviolet. They can be regulated upon being placed on a spatial lattice and working at finite inverse temperature. Unlike in conventional field theories, the details of the lattice-regulated Carrollian theories remain important at long distances even in the limit that the lattice spacing is sent to zero. We use that limit to define interacting continuum models with a tractable perturbative expansion. The ensuing theories are those of generalized free fields, with non-Gaussian correlations suppressed by positive powers of the lattice spacing, and an unbroken supertranslation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation from the core-bounce phase of rotating core collapse supernovae in real interferometer noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose an analytical model that reproduces the core-bounds phase of gravitational waves (GW) of Rapidly Rotating (RR) from Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSNe), as a function of three parameters, the arrival time $\tau$, the ratio of the kinetic and potential energy $\beta$ and a phenomenological parameter $\alpha$ related to rotation and equation of state (EOS). To validate the model we use 126 waveforms from the Richers catalog \cite{Richers_2017} selected with the criteria of exploring a range of rotation profiles, and involving EOS. To quantify the degree of accuracy of the proposed model, with a particular focus on the rotation parameter $\beta$, we show that the average Fitting Factor (FF) between the simulated waveforms with the templates is 94.4\%. In order to estimate the parameters we propose a frequentist matched filtering approach in real interferometric noise which does not require assigning any priors. We use the Matched Filter (MF) technique, where we inject a bank of templates considering simulated colored Gaussian noise and the real noise of O3L1. For example for A300w6.00\_BHBLP at 10Kpc we obtain a standar deviation of $\sigma = 3.34\times 10^{-3}$ for simulated colored Gaussian noise and $\sigma= 1.46\times 10^{-2}$ for real noise. On the other hand, from the asymptotic expansion of the variance we obtain the theoretical minimum error for $\hat{\beta}$ at 10 kpc and optimal orientation. The estimation error in this case is from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$ as $\beta$ increases. We show that the results of the estimation error of $\beta$ for the 3-parameter space (3D) is consistent with the single-parameter space (1D), which allows us to conclude that $\beta$ is decoupled from the others two parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the role played by topology, and some specific boundary conditions as well, on the physics of a higher-dimensional black hole. We analyze the line element of a five-dimensional non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole to obtain a new family of subspaces that are types of strong retractions and deformations, and then we extend these results to higher dimensions in order to deduce the relationship between various types of transformations. We also study the scalar field perturbations in the background under consideration and obtain an analytical expression for the quasibound state frequencies by using the Vieira-Bezerra-Kokkotas approach, which uses the polynomial conditions of the general Heun functions, and then we discuss the stability of the system and present the radial eigenfunctions. Our main goal is to discuss the physical meaning of these mathematical applications in such higher-dimensional effective metric.</description>

      <title>New and Robust Gravitational-Waveform Model for High-Mass-Ratio Binary Neutron Star Systems with Dynamical Tidal Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the analysis of gravitational-wave signals, fast and accurate gravitational-waveform models are required. These enable us to obtain information on the system properties from compact binary mergers. In this article, we introduce the NRTidalv3 model, which contains a closed-form expression that describes tidal effects, focusing on the description of binary neutron star systems. The model improves upon previous versions by employing a larger set of numerical-relativity data for its calibration, by including high-mass ratio systems covering also a wider range of equations of state. It also takes into account dynamical tidal effects and the known post-Newtonian mass-ratio dependence of individual calibration parameters. We implemented the model in the publicly available LALSuite software library by augmenting different binary black hole waveform models (IMRPhenomD, IMRPhenomX, and SEOBNRv5_ROM). We test the validity of NRTidalv3 by comparing it with numerical-relativity waveforms, as well as other tidal models. Finally, we perform parameter estimation for GW170817 and GW190425 with the new tidal approximant and find overall consistent results with respect to previous studies.</description>

Abstract: The recent analysis of quantum cosmology by S. Gielen [1] is extended by discussing the case of dust (in the flat case). The dependence of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation on the operator ordering of the Hamiltonian in the case of a position dependent mass is explored, together with the {\Lambda} dependence. As a main result, it is shown that matter enforces a quantized wave function as a solution of the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the anti-de Sitter case.</description>

Abstract: Advancements in cosmology through next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will bring in a paradigm shift. We explore the pivotal role that gravitational-wave standard sirens will play in inferring cosmological parameters with next-generation observatories, not only achieving exquisite precision but also opening up unprecedented redshifts. We examine the merits and the systematic biases involved in gravitational-wave standard sirens utilizing binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole mergers. Further, we estimate the precision of bright sirens, golden dark sirens, and spectral sirens for these binary coalescences and compare the abilities of various next-generation observatories (A^sharp, Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope, and their possible networks). When combining different sirens, we find sub-percent precision over more than 10 billion years of cosmic evolution for the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$. This work presents a broad view of opportunities to precisely measure the cosmic expansion rate, decipher the elusive dark energy and dark matter, and potentially discover new physics in the uncharted Universe with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Ladder Symmetries and Love Numbers of Reissner--Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity have vanishing tidal Love numbers. In the case of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, this property has been shown to be a consequence of a hidden structure of ladder symmetries for the perturbations. In this work, we extend the ladder symmetries to non-rotating charged black holes in general relativity. As opposed to previous works in this context, we adopt a more general definition of Love numbers, including quadratic operators that mix gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations in the point-particle effective field theory. We show that the calculation of a subset of those couplings in full general relativity is affected by an ambiguity in the split between source and response, which we resolve through an analytic continuation. As a result, we derive a novel master equation that unifies scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations around Reissner--Nordstr\"om black holes. The equation is hypergeometric and can be obtained from previous formulations via nontrivial field redefinitions, which allow to systematically remove some of the singularities and make the presence of the ladder symmetries more manifest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravitational effects, on the one hand, lead to a limitation in the accuracy of measuring spatial and time intervals, and, on the other hand, they generate a discrete of spacetime structure (quantum foam). The common source of both measurement limitations and discreteness of space-time are quantum fluctuations, so their characteristics must be related to each other. We study such a relationship using Barrow entropy as a source of fractal space-time structure. The minimum inaccuracy in measuring space-time intervals is expressed through the Barrow entropy parameter. The connection between the level of fractality and the speed of information processing is considered.</description>

Abstract: We study time symmetric initial data for asymptotically AdS spacetimes with conformal boundary containing a spatial circle. Such $d$-dimensional initial data sets can contain $(d-2)$-dimensional minimal surfaces if the circle is contractible. We compute the minimum energy of a large class of such initial data as a function of the area $A$ of this minimal surface. The statement $E \ge E_{min}(A)$ is analogous to the Penrose inequality which bounds the energy from below by a function of the area of a $(d-1)$-dimensional minimal surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the marginal loosely trapped surface (marginal LTS) for the Kerr spacetime with a small Kerr parameter perturbatively, where the LTS condition is saturated. An LTS is a surface that specifies the strong gravity region, which is a generalization of the photon sphere in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It turns out that there are an infinite number of marginal LTSs. At the leading order of the small Kerr parameter, all of the marginal LTSs have the same area. However, one can see that the maximal marginal LTS among them is uniquely determined at the higher order.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Fluctuation Theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the recently proposed covariant framework of general relativistic stochastic mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics, we proved the detailed and integral fluctuation theorems in curved spacetime. The time-reversal transformation is described as a transformation from the perspective of future-directed observer to that of the corresponding past-directed observer, which enables us to maintain general covariance throughout the construction. The result presented in this work may be applied in understanding the origin of irreversibility in macroscopic processes in the presence of relativistic gravity, as in most astrophysical or cosmological processes.</description>

      <title>Charged analogues of a singularity-free anisotropic compact star under linear $f(Q)$- action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study simulates the characteristics of spherically symmetric, anisotropic compact stellar bodies with electrical charge within the context of the $f(Q)$ theory of gravity. Employing the Krori-Barua metric ansatz (K.D. Krori, J. Barua, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 8 (1975) 508) along with a linear form of $f(Q)$ model, {\it viz.}, $f(Q)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}Q$, we obtain a tractable set of exact relativistic solutions of the field equations. A specific form of charge $(q=q_{0}r^{3})$ is considered here for the present analysis. Using the data sets of $\rho$ and $p_{r}$ along with the method of curve fitting, we have obtained the best fit equation of state in the model, which is incorporated in the numerical solutions of the TOV equations to determine the maximum mass and radius in this scenario. With increasing charge intensity $(q_{0})$ from 0.0002 to 0.0006, the maximum mass ranges from $2.838-2.869~M_{\odot}$, and the corresponding radii range from $12.0039-12.0822~Km$. Moreover, the predicted radii of some recently observed pulsars and GW 190814 show that our model also complies with the estimated radii based on the observational results. Our model is found to satisfy all the characteristic features, such as behaviour of matter variables, causality condition, energy constraints and stability criteria, which are pertinent in the context of a stable stellar configuration to emerge as a viable and physically acceptable stellar model in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Positivity for Phenomenologists: Dark Gauge Boson in the Swampland</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational positivity bound gives quantitative "swampland'' constraints on low-energy effective theories inside theories of quantum gravity. We give a comprehensive discussion of this bound for those interested in applications to phenomenological model building. We present a practical recipe for deriving the bound, and discuss subtleties relevant for realistic models. As an illustration, we study the positivity bound on the scattering of the massive gauge bosons in the Higgs/St\"{u}ckelberg mechanism. Under certain assumptions on gravitational amplitudes at high energy, we obtain a lower bound $m_{V} \gtrsim \Lambda_\mathrm{UV}^2 /g M_\mathrm{Pl}$ on the gauge boson mass $m_V$, where $g$ is the coupling constant of the gauge field, $M_\mathrm{Pl}$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda_\mathrm{UV}$ is the ultraviolet cutoff of the effective field theory. This bound can strongly constrain new physics models involving a massive gauge boson.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic neutron star crust, solar system mountains, and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Mountains" or non-axisymmetric deformations of rotating neutron stars (NS) efficiently radiate gravitational waves (GW). We consider analogies between NS mountains and surface features of solar system bodies. Both NS and moons such as Europa or Enceladus have thin crusts over deep oceans while Mercury has a thin crust over a large metallic core. Thin sheets may wrinkle in universal ways. Europa has linear features, Enceladus has "Tiger" stripes, and Mercury has lobate scarps. NS may have analogous features. The innermost inner core of the Earth is anisotropic with a shear modulus that depends on direction. If NS crust material is also anisotropic this will produce an ellipticity, when the crust is stressed, that grows with spin frequency. This yields a braking index (log derivative of spin down rate assuming only GW spin down) very different from $n=5$ and could explain the maximum spin observed for neutron stars and a possible minimum ellipticity of millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternative to the embedding formalism, we provide a group theoretic approach to the conformal primary basis for the massless field with arbitrary helicity. To this end, we first point out that $sl(2,\mathds{C})$ isometry gets enhanced to $sl(2,\mathds{C})\times D$ symmetry for the solution space of the massless field with arbitrary helicity. Then associated with $sl(2,\mathds{C})\times D$ symmetry, we introduce the novel quadratic Casimirs and relevant tensor/spinor fields to derive 2 explicit constraints on the bulk dilatation and $sl(2,\mathds{C})$ Casimirs. With this, we further argue that the candidate conformal primary basis can be constructed out of the infinite tower of the descendants of the left and right highest (lowest) conformal primary wavefunction of $sl(2,\mathds{C})$ Lie algebra, and the corresponding celestial conformal weights are determined by the bulk scaling dimension through solving out the exact on-shell conformal primary wavefunctions, where on top of the two kinds of familiar-looking on-shell conformal primary wavefunctions, we also obtain another set of independent on-shell conformal primary wavefunctions for the massless field with helicity $|s|\ge 1$. In passing, we also develop the relationship between the 4D Lorentz Lie algebra and 2D conformal Lie algebra from scratch, and present an explicit derivation for the two important properties associated with the conformal primary wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Averaging over cosmic structure: Cosmological backreaction and the gauge problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation that accelerated cosmic expansion appears to start around the time that nonlinear cosmic structure is appearing seems like an extraordinary coincidence, unless the acceleration is somehow driven by the emergence of the structure. That has given rise to the controversial concept of a gravitational backreaction through which inhomogeneity becomes a driver of accelerated expansion. The standard route when studying strongly inhomogeneous cosmological models is to take either a perturbative approach or a spatial averaging approach. Here we argue that because backreaction is in fact a nonlinear multiscale phenomenon, perturbative approaches may have a limited validity. With respect to the currently proposed averaging approaches we here show that they lead to gauge dependent backreaction and hence ambiguous estimates of its magnitude. In the present study, we formalise inhomogeneous cosmic evolution within the framework of foliations of spacetime. Fixing a foliation amounts to making a gauge choice. Addressing the correspondence between the metric tensor and the foliation allows us to clarify the implications of choosing a foliation for the representation of equivalent cosmologies. It is important to note that, within the context of backreaction, this formalism allows us to discuss the vagaries of averaging in the framework of spacetime foliations. It reveals that spatial averaging can induce artificial, i.e. gauge dependent, backreaction terms that arise from any specific choice of gauge. Averaging methods presented so far all encounter this problem. However, within our foliation framework, we can produce a gauge invariant method of averaging by invoking the gauge-invariant Bardeen formalism for cosmological perturbation theory. We demonstrate that this implies the gauge invariance of the averaging procedure. This makes it applicable to standard cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating a Sigmoid Dark Energy Model to Explain the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study we analyze Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data sourced from the Pantheon+ compilation to investigate late-time physics effects influencing the expansion history, $H(z)$, at redshifts $(z &lt; 2)$. Our focus centers on a time-varying dark energy (DE) model that introduces a rapid transition in the equation of state, at a specific redshift, $z_a$, from the baseline, $\Lambda = -1$, value to the present value, $w_0$, through the implementation of a sigmoid function. The constraints obtained for the DE sigmoid phenomenological parametrization have broad applicability for dynamic DE models that invoke late-time physics. Our analysis indicates that the sigmoid model provides a slightly better, though not statistically significant, fit to the SNe Pantheon+ data compared to the standard LCDM alone. The fit results, assuming a flat geometry and maintaining $\Omega_m$ constant at the 2018-Planck value of $0.3153$, are as follows: $H_0 = 73.3^{+0.2}_{-0.6}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $w_{0} = -0.95^{+0.15}_{-0.02}$, $z_a = 0.8 \pm 0.46$. The errors represent statistical uncertainties only. The available SN dataset lacks sufficient statistical power to distinguish between the baseline LCDM and the alternative sigmoid models. A feature of interest offered by the sigmoid model is that it identifies a specific redshift, $z_a = 0.8$, where a potential transition in the equation of state could have occurred. The sigmoid model does not favor a DE in the phantom region ($w_0 &lt; -1$). Further constraints to the dynamic DE model have been obtained using CMB data to compute the distance to the last scattering surface. While the sigmoid DE model does not completely resolve the $H_0$ tension, it offers a transition mechanism that can still play a role alongside other potential solutions.</description>

      <title>Massive black hole binaries in LISA: constraining cosmological parameters at high redshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the scientific objectives of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is to probe the expansion of the Universe using gravitational wave observations. Indeed, as gravitational waves from the coalescence of a massive black hole binary (MBHB) carry direct information of its luminosity distance, an accompanying electromagnetic (EM) counterpart can be used to determine its redshift. This method of $bright$ $sirens$, when applied to LISA, enables one to build a gravitational Hubble diagram to high redshift. In this work, we forecast the ability of LISA-detected MBHB bright sirens to constrain cosmological models. The expected EM emission from MBHBs can be detected up to redshift $z\sim 7$ with future astronomical facilities, and the distribution of MBHBs with detectable counterpart peaks at $z\sim 2-3$. Therefore, we propose several methods to leverage the ability of LISA to constrain the expansion of the Universe at $z\sim 2-3$, a poorly charted epoch in cosmography. We find that the most promising method consists in using a model-independent approach based on a spline interpolation of the luminosity distance-redshift relation: in this case, LISA can constrain the Hubble parameter at $z\sim2-3$ with a relative precision of at least $10\%$.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of statistical tools for evaluating tensions in cosmological parameter estimates arising from distinct datasets. Focusing on the unresolved Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, we explore the Pantheon Plus + SH0ES (PPS) compilation, which includes low-redshift Cepheid data from the SH0ES collaboration, along with the latest release of CMB data from the Planck collaboration, Cosmic Chronometers (CC) dataset and the most recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) datasets. Employing various tension metrics, we quantitatively assess the inconsistencies in parameter estimates, emphasizing the importance of capturing multidimensional tensions. Our results reveal substantial tension between PPS and Planck 2018 datasets and moderate tension between the BAO data sets and all other datasets. We highlight the importance of adopting these metrics to enhance the precision of future cosmological analyses and facilitate the resolution of existing tensions.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes an alternative regularization method for handling the ultraviolet behavior of entanglement entropy. Utilizing an $i\epsilon$ prescription in the Euclidean double cone geometry, it accurately reproduces the universal behavior of entanglement entropy. The method is demonstrated in the free boson theory in arbitrary dimensions and two-dimensional conformal field theories. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the $i\epsilon$ regularization method in addressing ultraviolet issues in quantum field theory and gravity, suggesting potential applications to other calculable quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid neutron stars, the compact objects consisting hadronic matter and strange quark matter, can be considered as the probes for the scalar tensor gravity. In this work, we explore the scalarization of hybrid neutron stars in the scalar tensor gravity. For the hadronic phase, we apply a piecewise polytropic equation of state constrained by the observational data of GW170817 and the data of six low-mass X-ray binaries with thermonuclear burst or the symmetry energy of the nuclear interaction. In addition, to describe the strange quark matter inside the hybrid neutron star, different MIT bag models are employed. We study the effects of the value of bag constant, the mass of s quark, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter, and the density jump at the surface of quark-hadronic phase transition on the scalarization of hybrid neutron stars. Our results confirm that the scalarization is more sensitive to the value of bag constant, the mass of s quark, and the density jump compared to the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter.</description>

Abstract: We present a superfluid dark star model consisting of relativistic dark bosons with two-body self-interaction. The obtained masses, radii, and tidal deformability depend in a simple way on the boson mass and interaction strength. We report first results on binary mergers: the distinctive amplitude and frequency of the emitted gravitational waves are well within reach of terrestrial interferometers.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves from the inflation potential with a tiny Lorentz function bump</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) from the inflation potential with a tiny Lorentz function bump. We choose the Starobinsky model as basic potential, which satisfies the condition of observational constraints of the CMB at a large scale. We find that the tiny Lorentz function bump can enhance the primordial curvature power spectrum to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ at a small scale, leading to the formation of PBHs with sufficient abundance. Furthermore, we discover that the abundance of PBHs with mass $10^{-12}M_\odot$ is approximately $1$, which can make up almost all dark matter. In addition, the SIGWs generated by our models can be tested by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), TianQin, Taiji, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and DECIGO. It should be emphasized that, compared with the tiny Gaussian bump case, the Lorentz function bump case can easily produce a sufficient abundance of PBHs with a wider mass range, and accompanying a broader frequency range of SIGWs, which predicts the advantage of the Lorentz function bump for basic potential with big e-folding number $N$ around $55\sim60$.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum nature of gravity using a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the Bose-Einstein condensate which results in the decoherence. We observe that the decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.</description>

      <title>Center-less BMS charge algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when the Wald-Zoupas prescription is implemented, the resulting charges realize the BMS symmetry algebra without any 2-cocycle nor central extension, at any cut of future null infinity. We refine the covariance prescription for application to the charge aspects, and introduce a new aspect for Geroch's super-momentum with better covariance properties. For the extended BMS symmetry with singular conformal Killing vectors we find that a Wald-Zoupas symplectic potential exists, if one is willing to modify the symplectic structure by a corner term. The resulting algebra of Noether currents between two arbitrary cuts is center-less. The charge algebra at a given cut has a residual field-dependent 2-cocycle, but time-independent and non-radiative. More precisely, super-rotation fluxes act covariantly, but super-rotation charges act covariantly only on global translations. The take home message is that in any situation where 2-cocycles appears in the literature, covariance has likely been lost in the charge prescription, and that the criterium of covariance is a powerful one to reduce ambiguities in the charges, and can be used also for ambiguities in the charge aspects.</description>
