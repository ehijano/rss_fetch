      <title>Relativistic hydrodynamics with spinodal decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics that incorporate phase separation via spinodal decomposition. These equations consider surface effects between the two phases and are applicable for simulating intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions and binary neutron star mergers, where a first-order phase transition is expected. We solve these equations in the context of Bjorken flow, which offers the relevant geometric framework for ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of neutron-induced reaction cross sections using random-matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of neutron-induced nuclear reactions on $^{238}$U using the GOE-$S$-matrix model, in which the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) is embedded into the scattering ($S$) matrix. The GOE-$S$-matrix model does not require any experimental values of the average level spacing $D$ and average decay width $\Gamma$ with their statistical distributions, but the model is fully characterized by the channel transmission coefficients used in the Hauser-Feshbach theory. We demonstrate that the obtained compound nucleus decay width distribution resembles the $\chi$-squared distribution with the degree of freedom greater than unity. This approach enables us to generate fluctuating cross sections while preserving requisite unitarity and accounting for interference between resonances. By comparing the calculated cross section distribution with that from $R$-matrix theory, we demonstrate a smooth transition from the resolved resonance region to the continuum region.</description>

      <title>Next highest weight and other lower $SU(3)$ irreducible representations with proxy-$SU(4)$ symmetry for nuclei with $32 \le \mbox{Z,N} \le 46$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the applications of proxy-SU(3) model in the context of determining $(\beta,\gamma)$ values for nuclei across the periodic table, for understanding the preponderance of triaxial shapes in nuclei with $Z \ge 30$, it is seen that one needs not only the highest weight (hw) or leading $SU(3)$ irreducible representation (irrep) $(\lambda_H, \mu_H)$ but also the lower $SU(3)$ irreps $(\lambda ,\mu)$ such that $2\lambda + \mu =2\lambda_H + \mu_H-3r$ with $r=0,1$ and $2$ [Bonatsos et al., Symmetry {\bf 16}, 1625 (2024)]. These give the next highest weight (nhw) irrep, next-to-next highest irrep (nnhw) and so on. Recently, it is shown that for nuclei with $32 \le \mbox{Z,N} \le 46$, there will be not only proxy-$SU(3)$ but also proxy-$SU(4)$ symmetry [Kota and Sahu, Physica Scripta {\bf 99}, 065306 (2024)]. Following these developments, presented in this paper are the $SU(3)$ irreps $(\lambda ,\mu)$ with $2\lambda + \mu =2\lambda_H + \mu_H-3r$, $r=0,1,2$ for various isotopes of Ge, Se, Kr, Sr, Zr, Mo, Ru and Pd (with $32 \le \mbox{N} \le 46$) assuming good proxy-$SU(4)$ symmetry. A simple method for obtaining the SU(3) irreps is described and applied. The tabulations for proxy-$SU(3)$ irreps provided in this paper will be useful in further investigations of triaxial shapes in these nuclei.</description>

      <title>Bulk and spectroscopic nuclear properties within an ab initio renormalized random-phase approximation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modern chiral potential incorporating the three-body force is adopted to investigate bulk properties, spectra, and nuclear responses of closed-(sub)shell nuclei throughout the nuclear chart within a particle-hole (p-h) renormalized random-phase approximation (RRPA) scheme using a Hartree- Fock (HF) single-particle basis. Our analysis shows that all instabilities induced by the quasiboson approximation (QBA) underlying RPA are removed and an overall better consistency with the experiments is achieved for all observables of the investigated nuclei. The residual discrepancies point out the need of going beyond the p-h space.</description>

      <title>A new effective theory for stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal fluctuations are a fundamental feature of dissipative systems that are essential for understanding physics near the expected critical point of QCD and in small systems. When such fluctuations are modeled naively in relativistic systems, strange features can appear such as negative self-correlation functions. We construct an effective theory for nonlinear stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics that ensure a well-posed mathematical formulation. Using Crooks fluctuation theorem, we derive a symmetry of the effective action that incorporates fluctuations through a suitable free energy functional. For divergence type theories, the action can then be fully specified using a single vector generating current. The equations of motion obtained using this procedure are guaranteed to be flux conservative and symmetric hyperbolic when the dynamics is causal. This ensures that these equations are well-posed (for suitable initial data) and are in a form that can easily be simulated, including with Metropolis techniques.</description>

      <title>Properties of Neutron Stars with Hyperons within a Relativistic Metamodel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the effects of $\Lambda$-hyperons on neutron star properties employing a metamodel framework for the equation of state (EoS). Different choices for defining the hyperonic couplings with different levels of parametric freedom are discussed. In all models, the predicted NS maximum masses are reduced compared with the purely nucleonic composition as expected. In the case of relating hyperonic couplings via $SU(6)$-symmetry arguments to the nucleonic ones, we find that NS radii for intermediate mass stars are shifted to higher values compared with purely nucleonic stars, in agreement with the existing literature. However, allowing for more freedom for the hyperonic couplings, the effect is strongly reduced, and the distributions in the NS mass-radius plane of models with and without hyperons become very close. We have also investigated how different nucleonic density functionals influence the hyperon matter composition and neutron star properties.</description>

      <title>Chiral effects and Joule heating in hot and dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initial states of dense matter with nonzero electron chiral imbalance could potentially give rise to strong magnetic fields through chiral plasma instability. Previous work indicated that unless chiral chemical potential is as large as the electron vector chemical potential, the growth of magnetic fields due to the instability is washed out by chirality flipping rate enabled by electron mass. We re-examine this claim in a broader range of parameters and find that at higher temperatures the hierarchy is reversed supporting a growing magnetic field for an initial electron chiral chemical potential much smaller than the electron vector chemical potential. Further, we identify a qualitatively new effect relevant for magnetized hot and dense medium where chiral magnetic effect (CME) sourced by density fluctuation acts as a powerful source of Joule heating. Remarkably, even modest chiral chemical potentials (keV) in such environment can deposit energy densities set by the QCD scale in a relatively short time of the order of a few milliseconds or seconds. We speculate how this mechanism makes CME-driven Joule heating a potentially critical ingredient in the dynamics of turbulent density fluctuation of supernovae and neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Scaling properties of nuclear parton distributions in short-range-correlation motivated two-component parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide some critical remarks on the recently proposed two-component parametrization of nuclear parton distribution functions, which was motivated by the apparent correlation between the nuclear modifications of structure functions and nucleon-nucleon short-range correlation phenomena. This parametrization, we show, is invariant under a rescaling transformation of the involved abundance coefficients, which means that the global normalization of these coefficients cannot be meaningfully determined in a fit, and only their ratios should be studied for finding evidence of short-range-correlation type behavior at parton level. As we show, however, the current constraints for the nuclear-mass dependence of these coefficients allow also for interpretations different from short-range correlations. Nevertheless, this two-component parametrization exhibits a similar scaling relation for DIS structure functions as demonstrated in earlier works, and, as we demonstrate, yields testable predictions for structure-function and hard-process cross-section ratios. We also note on the non-trivial isospin dependence of the short-range-correlation motivated parametrization, which under proton-neutron pair dominance assumption can lead to charge-symmetry-violation resembling terms.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensation as a Unifying Mechanism for Special Spectra of Cosmic Gamma Rays and Low-Momentum Pion Enhancement at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding the internal structure of the proton is a fundamental challenge in physics. Historically, any new discovery about the proton has fuelled advances in several scientific fields. We have reported that gluons inside the proton accumulate near the critical momentum due to chaotic phenomena, forming gluon condensation. Surprisingly, the pion distribution predicted by this gluon distribution for the production of high-energy proton collisions could answer two puzzles in astronomy and high-energy physics. We find that during ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray collisions, gluon condensation may abruptly produce a large number of low-momentum pions, whose electromagnetic decays have the typical breakout properties appearing in various cosmic gamma-ray spectra. On the other hand, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is well below the cosmic ray energy scale, also shows weak but recognisable signs of gluon condensation, which had been mistaken for BEC pions. The connection between these two phenomena, which occur at different scales in the Universe, supports the existence of a new structure within the proton-gluon condensation.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative fluctuation effects of charged bosonic fields: A quark-diquark model study at nonzero density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the renormalization group flow of the scale-dependent effective potential of a quark-diquark model with full field dependence at nonzero chemical potential. This includes a discussion of approximations in relation to complex bosonic fields and the Silver-Blaze property. The resulting flow equation for the scale-dependent effective potential can in principle be solved down to the infrared limit. For our quark-diquark model, which may serve as a low-energy model for dense strong-interaction matter, we find that a competition between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer singularity and bosonic fluctuations can trigger a first-order phase transition at low temperatures that turns into a second-order phase transition at a tricritical point as the temperature increases.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Particle Monopole Form Factors with Ab Initio No-Core Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art ab initio nuclear many-body approaches with modern nuclear forces are challenged by the recent experimental measurement of the monopole form factor of the $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition in the $\alpha$ particle [Kegel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 152502 (2023)]. We investigate the elastic and inelastic $0^+_1\rightarrow 0^+_2$ transition form factors using the ab initio no-core shell model (NCSM). We observe a good convergence of both form factors with respect to the basis size employing the Daejeon16 nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interaction. Our NCSM results are very close to the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonic calculations using $NN$ plus three-nucleon interactions based on the chiral effective field theory which take into account the continuum effects via the Lorentz integral transform. The significant difference between the ab initio results with various modern nuclear interactions and of some of them with the recent experimental data provides motivations for deeper investigation of this observable.</description>

      <title>Flavour-Dependent Chemical Freeze-Out of Light Nuclei in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the production of light nuclei in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV within a flavour-dependent freeze-out framework, assuming different flavoured hadrons undergo separate chemical freeze-out. Using the Thermal-FIST package, thermal parameters extracted from fits to various sets of hadron yields, including and excluding light nuclei, are used to calculate the ratios of the yields of light nuclei, namely, $d/p$, $\bar{d}/\bar{p}$, $t/p$, and $t/d$. A comparison with data from the STAR and ALICE collaborations shows that a sequential freeze-out scenario provides a better description of light nuclei yield ratios than the traditional single freeze-out approach. These results suggest the flavour-dependent chemical freeze-out for final state light-nuclei production persists in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of pions, kaons and nucleons from dispersion relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors of pions, kaons and the nucleons are investigated by employing modern dispersive techniques and chiral perturbation theory. We determine the gravitational form factors of pions and kaons, extending our analysis to explore the pion mass dependence of these form factors at several unphysical pion masses up to 391 MeV, for which lattice results exist for the meson-meson scattering phase shifts. We also review our analysis on the nucleon gravitational form factors at the physical pion mass, and then systematically calculate various three-dimensional spatial and two-dimensional transverse density distributions for the nucleons. These results provide new insights into the mass distribution inside nucleons. As a by-product, we match our dispersion relation results and those obtained from chiral perturbation theory with external gravitational source at the next-to-next-to-leading order, yielding values for the low-energy constants $c_8=-4.28_{-0.38}^{+0.37} ~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and $c_9=-0.68_{-0.05}^{+0.06} ~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$. These results offer a robust benchmark for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Probing Nucleon-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$Interaction via Lattice QCD at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the S-wave interactions between the nucleon ($N$) and the triply charmed Omega baryon ($\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$) using (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with a physical pion mass ($m_\pi \simeq 137.1$ MeV) on a lattice volume $\simeq (8.1~\mathrm{fm})^3$. The charm quark is implemented with a relativistic heavy-quark action at its physical mass. Employing the time-dependent HAL QCD method, the $N$-$\Omega_{\mathrm{ccc}}$ potentials in the spin-1 ($^3\mathrm{S}_1$) and spin-2 ($^5\mathrm{S}_2$) channels are extracted. In both channels, overall attraction is found with the scattering parameters, $a_0 = 0.56(0.13)\left(^{+0.26}_{-0.03}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1.60(0.05)\left(^{+0.04}_{-0.12}\right)$ fm for the $^3\mathrm{S}_1$ channel, and
  $a_0 = 0.38(0.12)\left(^{+0.25}_{-0.00}\right)$ fm and $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2.04(0.10)\left(^{+0.03}_{-0.22}\right)$ fm for the $^5\mathrm{S}_2$ channel, indicating the absence of a dibaryon bound state. The extracted potentials are further decomposed into spin-independent and spin-dependent components. The spin-independent potential is a dominant component and features a short-range attractive core and a long-range attractive tail, while the spin-dependent potential shows short-range attraction (repulsion) in the spin-1 (spin-2) channel. Qualitative comparisons with previous studies of the $N$-$J/\psi$ and $N$-$\Omega_{\rm{sss}}$ systems at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV are provided, emphasizing the role of heavy-hadron chromo-polarizability arising from soft-gluon exchange between the nucleon and flavor-singlet hadrons. The charm quark mass dependence of the $N$-$\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ potential is investigated as well.</description>

Abstract: We investigate energy correlators in semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation as precision probes of parton hadronization dynamics. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns between the examined hadron and the rest of QCD radiations in both large-angle and small-angle limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs) and Fragmentation Energy Correlators (FECs). The two complementary regimes encode the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement, enabling a unified description of hadron formation across all kinematic regimes. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint N3LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for energy correlations both in the sudakov and jet fragmentation region (JFR). Our results demonstrate that semi-inclusive ECs provide direct, theoretically controlled access to QCD dynamics underlying hadronization, opening new avenues for precision studies at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>The N$^3$LO Twist-2 Matching of Helicity TMDs and SIDIS $q_\ast$ Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the twist-2 matching of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) helicity parton distribution and fragmentation functions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in QCD. This calculation entails the complete set of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) splitting functions govering the evolution of helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). Within TMD factorization framework, we quantify the impact of radiative corrections by completing the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^3$LL) prediction for lepton-hadron transverse momentum imbalance in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS). Our results provide the most precise theoretical input for probing the helicity structure and confined motion of quarks and gluons at future electron-ion collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Precision measurement and modelling of the threshold-free 210Pb {\beta} spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beta decay is a fundamental process that governs nuclear stability and serves as a sensitive probe of the weak interaction and possible physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. However, precise measurements of complete $\beta$ decay spectra, particularly at low energies, remain experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here we report a high-precision, threshold-free measurement of the full $\beta$ decay spectrum of 210Pb to excited states of 210Bi, using a transition-edge sensor (TES)-based micro-calorimeter. This approach enables the detection of $\beta$ particle energies from 0 keV up to their endpoint by coincidence summing with subsequent de-excitation energy, thereby eliminating reconstruction artifacts near zero energy that have traditionally limited low-energy spectral accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first complete, high-precision $\beta$ decay spectrum from 0 keV. The data resolve theoretical uncertainties associated with the atomic quantum exchange (AQE) effect. An accompanying ab initio theoretical framework, incorporating atomic, leptonic, and nuclear components, predicts a statistically significant (7.2 {$\sigma$}) enhancement in $\beta$ emission probability near zero energy, in agreement with the measurement and in contrast to models that omit AQE corrections. These results provide a new benchmark for $\beta$ decay theory at low energies, deepen our understanding of the weak interaction, and establish a critical foundation for searches for new physics, including dark matter interactions and precision studies of neutrinos.</description>
