      <title>GraphCNNpred: A stock market indices prediction using a Graph based deep learning system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of deep learning techniques for predicting stock market prices is a prominent and widely researched topic in the field of data science. To effectively predict market trends, it is essential to utilize a diversified dataset. In this paper, we give a graph neural network based convolutional neural network (CNN) model, that can be applied on diverse source of data, in the attempt to extract features to predict the trends of indices of \text{S}\&amp;\text{P} 500, NASDAQ, DJI, NYSE, and RUSSEL. The experiments show that the associated models improve the performance of prediction in all indices over the baseline algorithms by about $4\% \text{ to } 15\%$, in terms of F-measure. A trading simulation is generated from predictions and gained a Sharpe ratio of over 3.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Hedging with Iterated Integrals and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Wiener-Ito chaos decomposition to the class of continuous semimartingales that are exponentially integrable, which includes in particular affine and some polynomial diffusion processes. By omitting the orthogonality in the expansion, we are able to show that every $p$-integrable functional of the semimartingale, for $p \in [1,\infty)$, can be represented as a sum of iterated integrals thereof. Using finitely many terms of this expansion and (possibly random) neural networks for the integrands, whose parameters are learned in a machine learning setting, we show that every financial derivative can be approximated arbitrarily well in the $L^p$-sense. In particular, for $p = 2$, we recover the optimal hedging strategy in the sense of quadratic hedging. Moreover, since the hedging strategy of the approximating option can be computed in closed form, we obtain an efficient algorithm to approximately replicate any sufficiently integrable financial derivative within short runtime.</description>

      <title>Real Option Pricing using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present an alternative methodology to the standard Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC) applied to derivatives pricing. Our pipeline benefits from the combination of a new encoding protocol, referred to as the direct encoding, and a amplitude estimation algorithm, the modified Real Quantum Amplitude Estimation (mRQAE) algorithm. On the one hand, the direct encoding prepares a quantum state which contains the information about the sign of the expected payoff. On the other hand, the mRQAE is able to read all the information contained in the quantum state. Although the procedure we describe is different from the standard one, the main building blocks are almost the same. Thus, all the extensive research that has been performed is still applicable. Moreover, we experimentally compare the performance of the proposed methodology against the standard QAMC employing a quantum emulator and show that we retain the speedups.</description>
