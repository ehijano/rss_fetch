      <title>An ETH-ansatz-based environmental-branch approach to master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a method for deriving master equation is developed for a generic small quantum system, which is locally coupled to an environment as a many-body quantum chaotic system that satisfies the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ansatz, resorting to neither the Born approximation nor the Markov approximation. The total system undergoes Schr\"{o}dinger evolution, under an initial condition in which the environmental branches possess no correlation with the interaction Hamiltonian. Derivation of the master equation is based on piecewise usage of a second-order expansion of a formal expression, which is derived for the evolution of the environmental branches. Approximations used in the derivation are mainly based on dynamic properties of the environment.</description>

      <title>The Richness of Bell Nonlocality: Generalized Bell Polygamy and Hyper-Polygamy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-classical quantum correlations underpin both the foundations of quantum mechanics and modern quantum technologies. Among them, Bell nonlocality is a central example. For bipartite Bell inequalities, nonlocal correlations obey strict monogamy: a violation of one inequality precludes violations of other inequalities on the overlapping subsystems. In the multipartite setting, however, Bell nonlocality becomes inherently polygamous. This was previously shown for subsystems obtained by removing a single particle from an $N$-partite system. Here, we generalize this result to arbitrary $(N-k)$-partite subsystems with $k&gt;0$. We demonstrate that a single $N$-qubit state can violate all $\binom{N}{k}$ relevant Bell inequalities simultaneously. We further construct an $N$-qubit Bell inequality, obtained by symmetrizing the $(N-k)$-qubit ones, that is maximally violated by states exhibiting this generalized polygamy. We compare these violations with those achievable by GHZ states and show that polygamy offers an advantage in multipartite scenarios, providing new insights into scalable certification of non-classicality in quantum devices. Our analysis relies on symmetry properties of the MABK inequalities. Finally, we show that this behavior can occur across multiple subsystem sizes, a phenomenon we call hyper-polygamy. These structures reveal the remarkable abundance of nonlocality present in multipartite quantum states and offer perspectives for their applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Slow dynamics and magnon bound states in the 2D long-range quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of long-range quantum Ising models represents a current frontier in experimental physics, notably in trapped ions or Rydberg atomic systems. However, a theoretical description of these dynamics beyond 1D remains a significant challenge for conventional methods. Here, we address this challenge by means of neural quantum states to simulate global quenches from the fully polarized ferromagnetic state in the 2D quantum Ising model with power-law decaying interactions. From these numerically exact simulations, we find that the dynamics exhibit slow relaxation with long-lived oscillations. We explain this behavior through a theory for the formation of magnon bound states, which are generated, as we show, through effective attractive interactions between magnons that persist over several lattice sites due to the power-law nature of the interactions. Our results are readily observable in current quantum simulation platforms realizing long-range interacting models such as in Rydberg atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the dynamical preparation of quantum spin lakes on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are elusive long-range entangled states. Motivated by experiments in Rydberg quantum simulators, recent excitement has centered on the possibility of dynamically preparing a state with quantum spin liquid correlation even when the ground state phase diagram does not exhibit such a topological phase. Understanding the microscopic nature of such quantum spin "lake" states and their relationship to equilibrium spin liquid order remains an essential question. Here, we extend the use of approximately symmetric neural quantum states for real-time evolution and directly simulate the dynamical preparation in systems of up to $N=384$ atoms. We analyze a variety of spin liquid diagnostics as a function of the preparation protocol and optimize the extent of the quantum spin lake thus obtained. In the optimal case, the prepared state shows spin-liquid properties extending over half the system size, with a topological entanglement entropy plateauing close to $\gamma = \ln 2$. We extract two physical length scales $\lambda$ and $\xi$ which constrain the extent of the quantum spin lake $\ell$ from above and below.</description>

      <title>Quantum bootstrap for central potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum-mechanical bootstrap as it applies to the bound states of several central potentials in three dimensions. As part of this effort, we show how the bootstrap approach may be applied to ``non-algebraic'' potentials, such as the Yukawa potential (which asymptotically decays as an exponential) and a Gaussian potential. We additionally review the bootstrap of the Coulomb potential, demonstrate a high-precision bootstrap of the Cornell potential, and study conformal quantum mechanics. These results further recommend the bootstrap as a numerical method for high-precision calculations of ground-state physics, where applicable: for example, we are able to determine the critical coupling in the Cornell potential to better than one part in $10^7$, the most precise determination to date. Lower bounds on energies are also of high precision, occasionally one part in greater than $10^8$. Finally, we discuss the circumstances under which we are able to obtain meaningful upper bounds on ground-state energies.</description>

      <title>Dressed-state Hamiltonian engineering in a strongly interacting solid-state spin ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum science applications, ranging from many-body physics to quantum metrology, dipolar interactions in spin ensembles are controlled via Floquet engineering. However, this technique typically reduces the interaction strength between spins, and effectively weakens the coupling to a target sensing field, limiting the metrological sensitivity. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a method for direct tuning of the native interaction in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Our approach utilizes dressed-state qubit encoding under a magnetic field perpendicular to the crystal lattice orientation. This method leads to a $3.2\times$ enhancement of the dimensionless coherence parameter $JT_2$ compared to state-of-the-art Floquet engineering, and a $2.6\times$ ($8.3~$dB) enhanced sensitivity in AC magnetometry. Utilizing the extended coherence we experimentally probe spin transport at intermediate to late times. Our results provide a powerful Hamiltonian engineering tool for future studies with NV ensembles and other interacting higher-spin ($S&gt;\frac{1}{2}$) systems.</description>

      <title>Subradiant collective states for precision sensing via transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an ensemble of quantum emitters interacts with a common radiation field, their emission becomes collective, giving rise to superradiant and subradiant states, characterized by broadened and narrowed linewidths. In this work, we propose to harness subradiant states for quantum metrology; such states naturally arise in subwavelength-spaced atomic arrays in free space and in small ensembles of emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides. We demonstrate that their collective optical response yields sharp, narrow features in the transmittance spectrum, which can be used to enhance sensitivity to external perturbations. This improved sensitivity can be applied to atomic clock operation, spatially resolved imaging of emitter positions, and enables precise detection of both global and spatially varying detunings (such as those induced by electromagnetic fields or gravitational gradients).</description>

      <title>Certified Private Quantum Time Ticks Away Faster than Any Classical Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09100v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an entangled clock, where the flow of time is operationally defined by the discrete registration of measurement outcomes on a singlet state. Comparing the synchronization rate of two such clocks against classical models, we find that at obtuse relative angles, the quantum clock ticks strictly faster than this classical benchmark. We further propose a protocol for Certified Private Time, adapting device-independent randomness certification to the temporal domain; this guarantees a sovereign timeline that ticks away faster than any local realistic mechanism allows.</description>

      <title>Islands of Instability in Nonlinear Wavefunction Models in the Continuum: A Different Route to "Chaos"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two previous papers the author described ``Islands of Instability" that may appear in wavefunction models with nonlinear evolution (of a type proposed originally in the context of the Measurement Problem). Such ``IsoI" represent a new scenario for Hamiltonian systems implying so-called ``chaos". Criteria was derived for, and shown to be fulfilled in, some finite-dimensional (multi-qubit) models, and generalized in the second paper to continuum models. But the only example produced of the latter was a model whose linear Schrodinger equation was exactly-solvable. As exact solutions of many-body problems are rare, here I show that the instability criteria can be verified by plugging test-functions into certain computable expressions, bypassing the solvability blockade. The method can accommodate realistic inter-molecular potentials and so may be relevant to instabilities in fluids and gasses.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Squeezing and Faster Metrology from Layered Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin squeezing is a powerful resource for quantum metrology, and recent hardware platforms based on interacting qubits provide multiple possible architectures to generate and reverse squeezing during a sensing protocol. In this work, we compare the sensing performance of three such architectures: quantum reservoir computers (QRCs), quantum perceptrons, and multi-layer quantum neural networks (QNNs), when used as squeezing-based field sensors. For all models, we consider a standard metrological sequence consisting of coherent-spin preparation, one-axis-twisting dynamics, field encoding via a weak rotation, time-reversal, and collective readout. We show that a single quantum perceptron generates the same optimal sensitivity as a QRC, but in the perturbative regime it benefits from accelerated squeezing due to steering by the output qubit. Stacking perceptrons into a QNN further amplifies this effect: in a 2-layer QNN with N_in input and N_out output qubits, the optimal squeezing time is reduced by a factor of N_out, while the achievable phase sensitivity remains Heisenberg-limited, Delta phi ~ 1/(N_in + N_out). Moreover, if the layers are used sequentially, first using the outputs to squeeze the inputs and then the inputs to squeeze the outputs, the two contributions to the response add constructively. This yields a sqrt(2) enhancement in sensitivity over a QRC when N_in = N_out and requires shorter total squeezing time. Generalizing to L layers, we show that the metrological gain scales as sqrt(L) while the required squeezing time decreases as 1/N_l, where N_l is the number of qubits per layer. Our results demonstrate that the structure of quantum neural networks can be exploited not only for computation, but also to engineer faster and more sensitive squeezing-based quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Transition rates and their applications in accelerated single-qubit for fermionic spinor field coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interaction between a uniformly accelerated single qubit and a fermionic spinor field. Here we consider both the massless and the massive fermionic spinor fields. The qubit-field interaction occurs over a finite time and was evolved via perturbation theory. This approach yields the transition probability rates, from which we subsequently evaluate the quantum coherence of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector initially prepared in a qubit state. Our findings reveal that the UDW detector responds more when coupled with the fermionic field, and consequently, quantum coherence (for the fermionic case) degrades much more rapidly when compared to the case of the qubit linearly coupled with the scalar field. Moreover, the analysis suggests that particle mass plays a protective role against Unruh-induced decoherence as the rest mass energy becomes comparable to the detector's energy-level spacing, the detector's excitation probability and response decreases, which leads to the mitigation of quantum coherence degradation in accelerated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exact and Efficient Stabilizer Simulation of Thermal-Relaxation Noise for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizer-based simulation of quantum error-correcting codes typically relies on the Pauli-twirling approximation (PTA) to render non-Clifford noise classically tractable, but PTA can distort the behavior of physically relevant channels such as thermal relaxation. Physically accurate noise simulation is needed to train decoders and understand the noise suppression capabilities of quantum error correction codes. In this work, we develop an exact and stabilizer-compatible model of qubit thermal relaxation noise and show that the combined amplitude damping and dephasing channel admits a fully positive probability decomposition into Clifford operations and reset whenever $T_2 \leqslant T_1$. For $T_2 &gt; T_1$, the resulting decomposition is negative, but allows a smaller sampling overhead versus independent channels. We further introduce an approximated error channel with reset that removes the negativity of the decomposition while achieving higher channel fidelity to the true thermal relaxation than PTA, and extend our construction to finite temperature relaxation. We apply the exact combined model to investigate large surface codes and bivariate bicycle codes on superconducting platforms with realistic thermal relaxation error. The differing logical performances across code states further indicate that noise-model-informed decoders will be essential for accurately capturing thermal-noise structure in future fault-tolerant architectures.</description>

      <title>Parallel accelerated electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy using diamond sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center can serve as a magnetic sensor for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. Benefiting from its atomic size, the diamond chip can integrate a tremendous amount of NV centers to improve the magnetic-field sensitivity. However, EPR spectroscopy using NV ensembles is less efficient due to inhomogeneities in both sensors and targets. Spectral line broadening induced by ensemble averaging is even detrimental to spectroscopy. Here we show a kind of cross-relaxation EPR spectroscopy at zero field, where the sensor is tuned by an amplitude-modulated control field to match the target. The modulation makes detection robust to the sensor's inhomogeneity, while zero-field EPR is naturally robust to the target's inhomogeneity. We demonstrate an efficient EPR measurement on an ensemble of roughly 30000 NV centers. Our method shows the ability to not only acquire unambiguous EPR spectra of free radicals, but also monitor their spectroscopic dynamics in real time.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization--group and effective--action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity- motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>

      <title>Harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum in a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose an experimentally viable scheme to explore the transfer of nonclassical correlations from a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to a pair of impurities immersed in it. Operating at ultra-low temperature, density fluctuations of the dipolar BEC emulate a vacuum field with Lorentz-violating dispersion, while the two impurities function as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for the BEC quasiparticles. We study the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum of this analogue Lorentz-violating quantum field by spatially separated Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Our analysis reveals key parameter dependencies that optimize the harvesting of entanglement. In particular, unlike the Lorentz-invariant case, smoother detector switchings does not enhance the entanglement harvesting efficiency from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum. Moreover, the strength of the Lorentz-invariant violation can shift the optimal energy structure of the detectors for harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum-a clear deviation from the Lorentz-invariant scenario. As a fundamental quantum mechanical setup, our quantum fluid platform provides an experimentally realizable testbed for examining the entanglement harvesting protocol from an effective Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum using a pair of impurity probers, which may also has potential implications for exploring the Lorentz-invariant violation in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Mpemba as an Emergent Effect of System Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MpE), where a far-from-equilibrium state of a system relaxes faster compared to a state closer to it, is a well-known counterintuitive phenomenon in classical and quantum systems. Various system-specific theories have been proposed to explain this anomalous behavior in driven systems, though the fundamental mechanism of MpE in undriven systems, where MpE was first observed, remains unresolved. This paper provides a generic model of MpE for a quantum system following Markovian relaxation dynamics, regardless of system structure or environment. The key lies in the overlap of initial states with the fast relaxation mode; here, the constituents create a fast decay mode via interaction through the shared environment to show MpE, indicating MpE happens due to the collective behavior of the system. I also show that a system with anisotropic relaxation naturally exhibits MpE, even without a shared environment among the particles.</description>

      <title>Routes of Transport in the Path Integral Lindblad Dynamics through State-to-State Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing routes of transport for open quantum systems with non-equilibrium initial conditions is extremely challenging. The state-to-state approach [A. Bose, and P.L. Walters, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 15, 4828-4836] has proven to be a useful method for understanding transport mechanisms in quantum systems interacting with dissipative thermal baths, and has been recently extended to non-Hermitian systems to account for empirical loss. These non-Hermitian descriptions are, however, not capable of describing empirical processes of more general nature, including but not limited to a variety of pumping processes. We extend the state-to-state analysis to account for Lindbladian descriptions of generic dissipative, pumping and decohering processes acting on a system which is exchanging energy with a thermal bath. This Lindblad state-to-state method can elucidate routes of transport in systems coupled to a bath and additionally acted upon by Lindblad jump operators. The method is demonstrated using examples of excitonic aggregates subject to incoherent pumping and draining processes. Using this new state-to-state formalism, we demonstrate the establishment of steady-state excitonic currents across molecular aggregates, yielding a different first-principles approach to quantifying the same.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum frequency converters are key enabling technologies in photonic quantum information science to bridge the gap between quantum emitters and telecom photons. Here, we report a co- herent frequency converter scheme combining a fiber-coupled nonlinear optical Lithium Niobate waveguide with a fiber-pigtailed single-photon source based on semiconductor quantum dots. Single and indistinguishable photons are converted from 925.7 nm to the telecommunication C-band, with a 48.4% end-to-end efficiency and full preservation of single-photon purity and indistinguishability. The integration of the two fiber-based modules achieving top-level performance represents an im- portant step toward the practical interconnection of future quantum information processing systems operating at different wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Bandwidth of Hyper-Entangled Photons in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When light propagates through complex media, its output spatial distribution is highly sensitive to its wavelength. This fundamentally limits the bandwidth of applications ranging from imaging to communication. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that the spatial correlations of hyper-entangled photon pairs, simultaneously entangled spatially and spectrally, remain stable across a broad bandwidth: The chromatic modal dispersion experienced by one photon is canceled to first order by its spectrally anti-correlated twin, defining a "two-photon bandwidth" that can far exceed its classical counterpart. We illustrate this modal dispersion cancellation in multimode fibers, thin diffusers and blazed gratings, and demonstrate its utility for broadband wavefront shaping of quantum states. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of quantum light in complex media with applications in quantum imaging, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <title>LiePrune: Lie Group and Quantum Geometric Dual Representation for One-Shot Structured Pruning of Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) and parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are key building blocks for near-term quantum machine learning. However, their scalability is constrained by excessive parameters, barren plateaus, and hardware limitations. We propose LiePrune, the first mathematically grounded one-shot structured pruning framework for QNNs that leverages Lie group structure and quantum geometric information. Each gate is jointly represented in a Lie group--Lie algebra dual space and a quantum geometric feature space, enabling principled redundancy detection and aggressive compression. Experiments on quantum classification (MNIST, FashionMNIST), quantum generative modeling (Bars-and-Stripes), and quantum chemistry (LiH VQE) show that LiePrune achieves over $10\times$ compression with negligible or even improved task performance, while providing provable guarantees on redundancy detection, functional approximation, and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Can Intense Quantum Light Beat Classical Uncertainty Relations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty relations are fundamental to quantum mechanics, encoding limits on the simultaneous measurement of conjugate observables. Violations of joint uncertainty bounds can certify entanglement -- a resource critical for quantum information protocols and increasingly relevant in strong-field physics. Here, we investigate the pairwise time-delay and frequency-bandwidth uncertainties for arbitrary multimode quantum states of light, deriving a general lower bound for their joint product. We find that the nonclassical correction scales inversely with the average photon number, a behavior rooted in the so-called ``monogamy of entanglement''. These results clarify the intensity scaling of quantum advantages in nonclassical light states and highlight the interplay between entanglement and photon statistics.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points of arbitrary high orders induced by non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points are singularities in the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems in which several eigenvectors are linearly dependent and their eigenvalues are equal to each other. Usually it is assumed that the order of the exceptional point is limited by the number of degrees of freedom of a non-Hermitian system. In this letter, we refute this common opinion and show that non-Markovian effects can lead to dynamics characteristic of systems with exceptional points of higher orders than the number of degrees of freedom in the system. This takes place when the energy returns from reservoir to the system such that the dynamics of the system are divided into intervals in which it describes by the product of the exponential and a polynomial function of ever-increasing order. We demonstrate that by choosing the observation time, it is possible to observe exceptional points of arbitrary high orders.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Bayesian Optimization for Quantum Circuit Architecture Search with Uncertainty Calibrated Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit design is a key bottleneck for practical quantum machine learning on complex, real-world data. We present an automated framework that discovers and refines variational quantum circuits (VQCs) using graph-based Bayesian optimization with a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate. Circuits are represented as graphs and mutated and selected via an expected improvement acquisition function informed by surrogate uncertainty with Monte Carlo dropout. Candidate circuits are evaluated with a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier on the next generation firewall telemetry and network internet of things (NF-ToN-IoT-V2) cybersecurity dataset, after feature selection and scaling for quantum embedding. We benchmark our pipeline against an MLP-based surrogate, random search, and greedy GNN selection. The GNN-guided optimizer consistently finds circuits with lower complexity and competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to all baselines. Robustness is assessed via a noise study across standard quantum noise channels, including amplitude damping, phase damping, thermal relaxation, depolarizing, and readout bit flip noise. The implementation is fully reproducible, with time benchmarking and export of best found circuits, providing a scalable and interpretable route to automated quantum circuit discovery.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gradient Flow Algorithm for Symmetric Positive Definite Systems via Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation: Towards Quantum CAE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the Quantum Gradient Flow Algorithm (QGFA), a novel quantum algorithm for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems based on the variational formulation and time-evolution dynamics. Conventional quantum linear solvers, such as the quantum matrix inverse algorithm (QMIA), focus on approximating the matrix inverse through quantum signal processing (QSP). However, QMIA suffers from a crucial drawback: its computational efficiency deteriorates as the condition number increases. In contrast, classical SPD linear solvers, such as the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods, are known for their fast convergence, which stems from the variational optimization principle of SPD systems. Inspired by this, we develop QGFA, which obtains the solution vector through the gradient-flow process of the corresponding quadratic energy functional. To validate the proposed method, we apply QGFA to the displacement-based finite element method (FEM) for two-dimensional linear elastic problems under plane stress conditions. The algorithm demonstrates accurate convergence toward classical FEM solutions even with a moderate number of QSP phase factors. Compared with QMIA, QGFA achieves lower relative errors and faster convergence when initialized with suitable initial states, demonstrating its potential as an efficient preconditioned quantum linear solver. The proposed framework provides a physically interpretable connection between classical iterative solvers and quantum computational paradigms. These findings suggest that QGFA can serve as a foundation for future developments in Quantum Computer-Aided Engineering (Quantum CAE), including nonlinear and multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>Geometric Origin of Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate massless representations related to the extension of Poincar\`e group constructed in [1]. These representations differ from Wigner's ones of standard Poincar\`e group because the stabilizer of lightlike orbits has extra degrees of freedom. The unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of massless particles in this extension must decompose as a direct sum of a massless forward (positive zeroth component momentum) and massless backward (negative zeroth component momentum) Wigner's representations linked by internal two valued degree of freedom. We prove that these representations are unitarily equivalent to entangled states of two qubits. This provides a geometric origin of quantum entanglement for photons in the framework of quantum field theory: photons appear as superpositions of backward and forward propagating electromagnetic waves depending on a two valued parameter and this dependency gives rise to correlations between the values of local observables identical to those experienced with an entangled state of two qubits. Finally we describe an experiment capable of distinguishing the two different values of the parameter that links backward and forward massless representations providing experimental falsification of the theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed, large-scale quantum computing will need architectures that combine matter-based qubits with photonic links, but today's software stacks target either gate-based chips or linear-optical devices in isolation. We introduce Optyx, an open-source Python framework offering a unified language to program, simulate, and prototype hybrid, networked systems: users create experiments that mix qubit registers, discrete-variable photonic modes, lossy channels, heralded measurements, and real-time feedback; Optyx compiles them via ZX/ZW calculus into optimised tensor-network forms, and executes with state-of-the-art contraction schedulers based on Quimb and Cotengra. Benchmarking on exact multi-photon circuit simulations shows that, versus permanent-based methods, tensor network contraction can deliver speedups of orders of magnitude for low-depth circuits and entangled photon sources, and natively supports loss and distinguishability -- establishing it as both a high-performance simulator and a rapid-prototyping environment for next-generation photonic-network experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of detection of ``spin-boson'' entanglement by qubit only measurements. Such entanglement is impossible to detect by previously proposed schemes that involve a fixed system-environment interaction, because of inherent symmetries within the coupling and the initial state of the environment. We take advantage of the possibility of tuning of qubit-environment coupling, that is available in some qubit realizations. As an example we study a superconducting transmon qubit interacting with a microwave cavity, which is one of such systems and is, furthermore, essential in the context of quantum information processing. We propose suitable Hamiltonian parameters for the preparation and measurement phases of the detection scheme that allow for an experimental test, and verify that the reported signal is nonnegligibly large still at finite temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a new quantum key distribution protocol that uses the five qubit error correction code to detect the presence of eavesdropper reliably. The protocol turns any information theoretical attacks into a classical guess about the pattern. The logical qubit is encoded with a specific pattern into a block of five physical qubits. The security of the protocol relies on the correct pattern choice of Alice and Bob. Decoding with any wrong pattern choice increases multi qubit error rate and the 5 qubit code transforms an eavesdropper's logical disturbance into a signature that is detectable and distinguishable from natural channel noise up to a certain distance.</description>

      <title>Three-body interaction in a magnon-Andreev-superconducting qubit system: collapse-revival phenomena and entanglement redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-body interactions are fundamental for realizing novel quantum phenomena beyond pairwise physics, yet their implementation -- particularly among distinct quantum systems -- remains challenging. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum architecture comprising a magnonic mode (in a YIG sphere), an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ), and a superconducting qubit (SCQ), to realize a strong three-body interaction at the single-quantum level. Leveraging the spin-dependent supercurrent and circuit-integration flexibility of the ASQ, it is possible to engineer a strong tripartite coupling that jointly excites both qubits upon magnon annihilation (or excites magnons and SCQs upon ASQ deexcitation). Through analytical and numerical studies, we demonstrate that this interaction induces synchronized collapse and revival in qubit populations when the magnon is initially prepared in a coherent state. Notably, during the collapse region -- where populations remain static -- the entanglement structure undergoes a dramatic and continuous reorganization. We show that the genuine tripartite entanglement is redistributed into bipartite entanglement between the two qubits, and vice versa, with the total entanglement conserved. These phenomena, unattainable via two-body couplings, underscore the potential of three-body interactions for exploring intrinsically new quantum effects and advancing hybrid quantum information platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum secret sharing (DI-QSS) is a cryptographic protocol that overcomes the security limitations posed by untrusted quantum devices. We propose a DI-QSS protocol based on the multipartite pseudo-telepathy parity game, which achieves device-independence with simultaneous key generation without requiring dedicated test rounds, unlike CHSH-based schemes [Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. A, 2024]. Notably, the proposed scheme allows simultaneous device-independence verification and key-generation phases, achieving optimal performance for a seven-qubit GHZ state configuration. Further, we analyse the security of our protocol against collective attack and establish reduced resource requirement for the same length of the raw key compared to the previous protocol. Finally, we show that our protocol remains robust even in a noisy environment.</description>

      <title>Dynamic stimulated emission for deterministic addition and subtraction of propagating photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon subtraction and addition are essential non-Gaussian processes in quantum optics, where conventional methods using linear optics and number-resolving detection often suffer from low success probability. Here, we introduce the concept of \textit{dynamic stimulated emission}, whereby a quantum emitter undergoes stimulated emission with a time-dependent coupling. We show that, for both two- and three-level emitters, this process can be used to deterministically add or subtract a photon to a single propagating optical mode. We provide semi-analytic solutions to this problem for Fock states, enabling deterministic and unconditional single-photon subtraction and addition with fidelity ${\cal F}&gt;0.996$. Our semi-analytic solutions are provided for both dynamically coupled two-level systems and for three-level systems whose dynamical coupling is controlled by a coherent laser drive. Moving beyond individual Fock states, we further showcase the ability to subtract and add single photons to photon-number superposition states. We show that Schr\"{o}dinger cat states can be prepared from squeezed vacuum input via cascaded subtraction or cascaded addition. Finally, we show that our photon-addition process can be used to add a photon to any squeezed and displaced state with high success probability and fidelity ${\cal F}&gt;0.99$, thereby potentially converting quantum emitters from single-photon sources to sources of single-photon-added Gaussian states without the need for inline squeezing. Our protocols provide a path towards integrating quantum emitters to construct efficient sources of single-mode non-Gaussian light beyond single photons.</description>

      <title>Quantum random number generation from the continuous variable payload for the SPOQC mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The necessity of random numbers for various tasks, from simulation to cryptography, is crucial and immense. Here we demonstrate CV-QRNG using the CV payload of the SPOQC mission. The homodyne setup for QRNG uses the laser from the payload, in addition to potentially being used as detector in the case of an uplink scenario. Here we quantify the extractable secure randomness from the QRNG setup, that involves homodyne measurement of the vacuum states. The extracted randomness is tested against NIST test suite in addition to formally upper bounding the min-entropy. With the raw key length being $\approx1$ Mb in a given satellite pass, we get a total length of $\approx19.5$ Kb of certified random numbers from the 12-bit ADC.</description>

      <title>Quantumness certification via non-demolition measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental question of when a static or dynamic system should be deemed intrinsically quantum remains a challenge to address in absolute terms. A rigorous criterion, however, can be established by focusing on the measurable or reconstructible features of the system. This determination transcends mere issues of a system's classical simulability or computational complexity. Instead, the critical requirement lies in the certification (ideally, in real-time) of the emergence and persistence of genuine quantum features, principally entanglement and quantum superposition. Quantum Non-Demolition Measurements (QNDM) serve as the appropriate instrument for this certification, both from a theoretical and experimental standpoint. In this review paper, we demonstrate, with accessible clarity, how the implementation of QNDM can be directly linked to a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of macrorealism in finite-dimensional systems, establishing a conceptual parallel with Leggett-Garg inequalities. Using concrete examples that detail the detection of negative terms in the quasi-probability density function resulting from QNDM, we introduce the core concepts for certifying genuinely quantum features. As specific examples, we discuss an application where the quantum-to-classical transition due to the interaction with an environment can be tracked by QNDM. Moreover, we argue about the robustness of QNDM protocols in the presence of noise sources and their advantages with respect to the Leggett-Garg inequalities. Because of its straightforward implementation, the QNDM approach can be of direct relevance to both the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, where a controlled generation and certification of genuinely quantum resources is a central concern.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction via purification using a single auxiliary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a single auxiliary-assisted purification-based framework for quantum error correction, capable of correcting errors that drive a system from its ground-state subspace into excited-state sectors. The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle.</description>

      <title>Rotational excitation of molecules in the regime of strong ro-vibrational coupling: Comparison between an optical centrifuge and a transform-limited pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the ability of an optical centrifuge - a laser pulse whose linear polarization is rotating at an accelerated rate, to control molecular rotation in the regime when the rigid-rotor approximation breaks down due to coupling between the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Our analysis demonstrates that the centrifuge field enables controlled excitation of high rotational states while maintaining relatively low spread along the vibrational coordinate. We contrast this to the rotational excitation by a linearly polarized Gaussian pulse of equal spectral width and pulse energy which, although comparable to the centrifuge-induced rotation, is unavoidably accompanied by a substantial broadening of the vibrational wavepacket.</description>

      <title>Optimal certification of constant-local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of certifying local Hamiltonians from real-time access to their dynamics. Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$, matching the known $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$). In contrast, our algorithm requires neither inverse evolution nor controlled operations: it uses only forward real-time dynamics and achieves optimal intolerant certification for all constant-locality Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Pinball: A Cryogenic Predecoder for Quantum Error Correction Decoding Under Circuit-Level Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key challenge is the design of decoders for real-time quantum error correction (QEC), which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle common, sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources present in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below a useful level in practical scenarios. Furthermore, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization.
  To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22 nm FDSOI technology, we achieve a peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 4 K power budget of 1.5 W, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the Ollivier Ricci curvature, a discrete analogue of the Ricci curvature defined via optimal transport on graphs and general metric spaces. This curvature has seen applications ranging from signaling fragility in financial networks to serving as basic quantities in combinatorial quantum gravity. For inputs given as a point cloud with pairwise distances, we show that our algorithm can achieve an exponential speedup over the best-known classical methods for two particular classes of problem. Our work is another step toward quantum algorithms for geometrical problems that are capable of delivering practical value while also informing fundamental theory.</description>

      <title>Transpiling quantum circuits by a transformers-based algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have gained popularity in machine learning due to their application in the field of natural language processing. They manipulate and process text efficiently, capturing long-range dependencies among data and performing the next word prediction. On the other hand, gate-based quantum computing is based on controlling the register of qubits in the quantum hardware by applying a sequence of gates, a process which can be interpreted as a low level text programming language. We develop a transformer model capable of transpiling quantum circuits from the qasm standard to other sets of gates native suited for a specific target quantum hardware, in our case the set for the trapped-ion quantum computers of IonQ. The feasibility of a translation up to five qubits is demonstrated with a percentage of correctly transpiled target circuits equal or superior to 99.98%. Regardless the depth of the register and the number of gates applied, we prove that the complexity of the transformer model scales, in the worst case scenario, with a polynomial trend by increasing the depth of the register and the length of the circuit, allowing models with a higher number of parameters to be efficiently trained on HPC infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Practical and Efficient Verification of Entanglement with Incomplete Measurement Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a practical and efficient framework for verifying entangled states when only a tomographically incomplete measurement setting is available-specifically, when access to observables is severely limited. We show how the experimental estimation of a small number of observables can be directly exploited to construct a large family of entanglement witnesses, enabling the efficient identification of entangled states. Moreover, we introduce an optimization approach, formulated as a semidefinite program, that systematically searches for those witnesses best suited to reveal entanglement under the given measurement constraints. We demonstrate the practicality of the approach in a proof-of-principle experiment with photon-polarization qubits, where entanglement is certified using only a fraction of the full measurement data. These results reveal the maximal usefulness of incomplete measurement settings for entanglement verification in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>True Random Number Generators on IQM Spark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random number generation is fundamental for many modern applications including cryptography, simulations and machine learning. Traditional pseudo-random numbers may offer statistical unpredictability, but are ultimately deterministic. On the other hand, True Random Number Generation (TRNG) offers true randomness. One way of obtaining such randomness are quantum systems, including quantum computers. As such the use of quantum computers for TRNG has received considerable attention in recent years. However, existing studies almost exclusively consider IBM quantum computers, often stop at using simulations and usually test only a handful of different TRNG quantum circuits. In this paper, we address those issues by presenting a study of TRNG circuits on Odra 5 a real-life quantum computer installed at Wroc{\l}aw University of Science and Technology. It is also the first study to utilize the IQM superconducting architecture. Since Odra 5 is available on-premises it allows for much more comprehensive study of various TRNG circuits. In particular, we consider 5 types of TRNG circuits with 105 circuit subvariants in total. Each circuit is used to generate 1 million bits. We then perform an analysis of the quality of the obtained random sequences using the NIST SP 800-22 and NIST SP 800-90B test suites. We also provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on quantum computer-based TRNGs.</description>

      <title>Error Mitigation of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Circuits with Soft Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is typically viewed as a suite of practical techniques for today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, with limited relevance once fault-tolerant quantum computers become available. In this work, we challenge this conventional wisdom by showing that QEM can continue to provide substantial benefits in the era of quantum error correction (QEC), and in an even more efficient manner than it does on current devices. We introduce a framework for logical-level QEM that leverages soft information naturally produced by QEC decoders, requiring no additional data, hardware modifications, or runtime overhead beyond what QEC protocols already provide. Within this framework, we develop and analyze three logical-level QEM techniques: post-selection and runtime abort policies, probabilistic error cancellation, and zero-noise extrapolation. Our techniques reduce logical error rates by more than 100x while discarding fewer than 0.1% of shots; they also provide in situ characterization of logical channels for QEM protocols. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our approach using a surface-code architecture and two state-of-the-art decoders based on tensor-network contraction and minimum-weight perfect matching. We evaluate logical-level QEM on random Clifford circuits and molecular simulation algorithms and find that, compared to previous approaches relying on QEC only or QEC combined with QEM, we can achieve up to 87.4% spacetime overhead savings. Our results demonstrate that logical-level QEM with QEC decoder soft information can reliably improve logical performance, underscoring the efficiency and usefulness of QEM techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Tomographic characterization of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in reciprocal space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enrich quantum physics by extending conventional phase diagrams, enabling novel topological phenomena, and realizing exceptional points with potential applications in quantum sensing. Here, we present an experimental photonic platform capable of simulating a non-unitary quantum walk generated by a peculiar type of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, largely unexplored in the literature. The novelty of this platform lies in its direct access to the reciprocal space, which enables us to scan the quasi-momentum across the entire Brillouin zone and thus achieve a precise tomographic reconstruction of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, indicated by the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. From the inferred Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve complex-valued band structures, resolve exceptional points in momentum space, and detect the associated parity-time symmetry breaking through eigenvector coalescence. Our results, presented entirely in quasi-momentum space, represent a substantial shift in perspective in the study of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We give an efficient 0.8395-approximation algorithm for the EPR Hamiltonian. Our improvement comes from a new nonlinear monogamy-of-entanglement bound on star graphs and a refined parameterization of a shallow quantum circuit from previous works. We also prove limitations showing that current methods cannot achieve substantially better approximation ratios, indicating that further progress will require fundamentally new techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze two simple models derived from a quantum-mechanical particle on an elliptical path. The first Hamiltonian operator is non-Hermitian but isomorphic to an Hermitian operator. It appears to exhibit the same two-fold degeneracy as the particle on a circular path. More precisely, $E_n=n^2E_1,\ n=1,2,\ldots$ (in addition to an exact eigenvalue $E_0=0$). The second Hamiltonian operator is Hermitian and does not exhibit such degeneracy. In this case the nth excited energy level splits at the nth order of perturbation theory. Both models can be described in terms of the same point-group symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Entanglement Cones via Rank-Constrained $C^*$-Convex Hulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the geometry of fundamental quantum cones, the separable cone ($\mathscr{P}_+$) and the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) cone ($\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{PPT}}$), under generalized non-commutative convexity. We demonstrate a sharp stability dichotomy analyzing $C^*$-convex hulls of these cones: while $\mathscr{P}_+$ remains stable under local $C^*$-convex combinations, its global $C^*$-convex hull collapses entirely to the cone of all positive semidefinite matrices, $\operatorname{MCL}(\mathscr{P}_+) = \mathscr{P}_0$. To gain finer control and classify intermediate structures, we introduce the concept of ``$k$-$C^*$-convexity'', by using the operator Schmidt rank of $C^*$-coefficients. This constraint defines a new hierarchy of nested intermediate cones, $\operatorname{MCL}_k(\cdot)$. We prove that this hierarchy precisely recovers the known Schmidt number cones for the separable case, establishing a generalized convexity characterization: $\operatorname{MCL}_k(\mathscr{P}_+) = \mathcal{T}_k$. Applied to the PPT cone, this framework generates a family of conjectured non-trivial intermediate cones, $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{PPT}, k}$.</description>

      <title>Internal spaces of fermion and boson fields, described with the superposition of odd and even products of $\gamma^{a}$, enable understanding of all the second-quantised fields in an equivalent way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the odd and even ``basis vectors'', which are the superposition of odd and even products of $\gamma^a$'s, to describe the internal spaces of the second quantised fermion and boson fields, respectively, offers in even-dimensional spaces, like it is $d=(13+1)$, the unique description of all the properties of the observed fermion fields (quarks and leptons and antiquarks and antileptons appearing in families) and boson fields (gravitons, photons, weak bosons, gluons and scalars) in a unique way, providing that all the fields have non zero momenta only in $d =(3+1)$ of the ordinary space-time, bosons have the space index $\alpha$ (which is for tensors and vectors $\mu =(0,1,2,3)$ and for scalars $\sigma \ge 5$). In any even-dimensional space, there is the same number of internal states of fermions appearing in families and their Hermitian conjugate partners as it is of the two orthogonal groups of boson fields having the Hermitian conjugate partners within the same group. A simple action for massless fermion and boson fields describes all the fields uniquely. The paper overviews the theory, presents new achievements and discusses the open problems of this theory.</description>

      <title>Swimming against a superfluid flow: Self-propulsion via vortex-antivortex shedding in a quantum fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A superfluid flows without friction below a critical velocity, exhibiting zero drag force on impurities. Above this threshold, superfluidity breaks down, and the internal energy is redistributed into incoherent excitations such as vortices. We demonstrate that a finite-mass, mobile impurity immersed in a flowing two-dimensional paraxial superfluid of light can \textit{swim} against the superfluid current when this critical velocity is exceeded. This self-propulsion is achieved by the periodic emission of quantized vortex-antivortex pairs downstream, which impart an upstream recoil momentum that results in a net propulsive force. Analogous to biological systems that minimize effort by exploiting wake turbulence, the impurity harnesses this vortex backreaction as a passive mechanism of locomotion. Reducing the impurity dynamics to the motion of its center of mass and using a point-vortex model, we quantitatively describe how this mechanism depends on the impurity geometry and the surrounding flow velocity. Our findings establish a fundamental link between internal-energy dissipation in quantum fluids and concepts of self-propulsion in active-matter systems, and opens new possibilities for exploiting vortices for controlled quantum transport at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Extreme statistics as a probe of the superfluid to Bose-glass Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains have highlighted the role of rare, chain-breaking events that favor localization, in particular for high-energy eigenstates related to many-body localization. In this context, we revisit the random-field XXZ spin-1/2 chain at zero temperature with ferromagnetic interactions, equivalent to interacting fermions or hard-core bosons in a random potential with attractive interactions. We argue that localization in this model can be characterized by chain-breaking events, which are probed by the extreme values of simple local observables, such as the on-site density or the local magnetization, that are readily accessible in both experiments and numerical simulations. Adopting a bosonic language, we study the disorder-induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition from superfluid (SF) to Bose glass (BG), and focus on the strong disorder regime where localization is driven by weak links. Based on high-precision density matrix renormalization group simulations, we numerically show that extreme local densities accurately capture the BKT transition, even for relatively short chains ranging from a few dozen to a hundred sites. We also discuss the SF-BG transition in the weak disorder regime, where finite-size effects pose greater challenges. Overall, our work seeks to establish a solid foundation for using extreme statistics of local observables, such as density, to probe delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains, both in the ground state and at high energy.</description>

      <title>Beyond Ginibre statistics in open Floquet chaotic systems with localized leaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spectral properties of driven quantum systems with a classically chaotic counterpart and spatially localized openness, such as optical or microwave billiards with leaks, deviate from predictions of Ginibre ensembles. Our analysis focuses on the leaky quantum standard map (QSM) of the kicked rotor. We compare its complex resonance spectrum with both Ginibre and truncated circular orthogonal ensembles (TCOEs). We find that the long-lived resonances follow TCOE statistics, reproducing the density of states and level spacing correlations, but depart from Ginibre predictions. Short-lived resonances, however, do not show a clear correspondence with either random-matrix ensemble. We also demonstrate that increasing the leak size takes the density of states of the TCOE toward the Ginibre limit, yet their spectral correlations remain distinct.</description>

      <title>On modeling quantum point contacts in quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum point contacts (QPC) are a key instrument in investigating the physics of edge excitations in the quantum Hall effect. However, at not-so-high bias voltage values, the predictions of the conventional point QPC model often deviate from the experimental data both in the integer and (more prominently) in the fractional quantum Hall regime. One of the possible explanations for such behaviors is the dependence of the tunneling between the edges on energy, an effect not present in the conventional model. Here we introduce two models that take QPC spatial extension into account: wide-QPC model that accounts for the distance along which the edges are in contact; long-QPC model accounts for the fact that the tunneling amplitude originates from a finite bulk gap and a finite distance between the two edges. We investigate the predictions of these two models in the integer quantum Hall regime for the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude. We find that these two models predict opposite dependences: the amplitude decreasing or increasing away from the Fermi level. We thus elucidate the effect of the QPC geometry on the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude and investigate its implications for transport observables.</description>

      <title>High-resolution broadband characterization of resonance dispersion in an optical microresonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the uneven free spectral range of an optical microresonator, which provides direct insight into group velocity dispersion, is essential for understanding and controlling Kerr frequency comb dynamics. In this work, we present a simple and highly precise method formeasuring the free spectral range over a 5 THz bandwidth in silicon nitride microresonators, leveraging a wavemeter with 0.4 MHz resolution. Our fully fibered plug-and-play experimental setup enables the accurate extraction of resonance frequencies. By carefully analyzing the spectral position of each resonance, we measure both second- and third-order free spectral range expansion coefficients. This approach offers a robust and accessible tool for dispersion characterization in integrated photonic circuits, paving the way for next-generation of Kerr comb sources and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Single particle dynamical signature of topology induced by single mode cavities in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Witnessing and tracking topological phase transitions induced by interactions with the environment is a crucial challenge. Among the various experimental approaches to detect topological properties, the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) has emerged as a powerful bulk probe in one-dimensional chiral systems, allowing the extraction of the topological invariant from single-particle dynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to multiple cavity modes via inter-cell hopping terms, focusing on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the MCD. We show that, whenever the frequency is larger than the static hopping amplitudes, the coupling induces a discontinuous jump in the MCD, already at small times, signaling that such a coupling also leaves a signature in the survival edge probability when the dynamics are initialized at one of the two edges. For frequencies comparable to the static hopping amplitudes, topological order competes with dissipative effects, which makes the MCD behave smoothly, retaining information about the driven-dissipative topology.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of local integrals of motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) is understood theoretically through the existence of an extensive number of local integrals of motion (LIOMs). These conserved quantities are related to the microscopic quantum degrees of freedom that are spatially localized. Here, we present a general framework for constructing exact LIOMs with the desired locality and quantum numbers supplied as input rather than arising as emergent properties. We show that one can express the task of finding LIOMs as an optimization problem. In simple cases, solving this problem amounts to matrix diagonalization, while in more complex settings, it connects to the question of finding classical ground states of spin-glass models. We illustrate our theory using paradigmatic examples of single-particle Anderson localization and MBL in interacting spin chains. These developments unify previous results and reveal intriguing connections among many-body localization, spin-glass physics and constrained optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic preparation of arbitrary two-component product states of fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an 8$\times$8 optical tweezer array, achieving motional ground-state fidelities above $98.5\,\%$. Leveraging the large differential magnetic moments for spin-resolution, with parallelized site- and number-resolved control, our approach addresses key challenges for low-entropy quantum state engineering. Combined with high-fidelity spin-, site-, and density-resolved readout within a single $20\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ exposure, and $3\,\mathrm{s}$ experimental cycles, these advances establish a fast, scalable, and programmable architecture for fermionic quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Photon emission by vortex particles accelerated in a linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the photon emission by charged spinless particles with phase vortices and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection in longitudinal electric and magnetic fields within the scalar QED. A realistic wave packet of an electron or ion accelerated by a radio-frequency wave locally feels a constant and spatially homogeneous field, which allows us to develop an effective model for losing the angular momentum of the vortex particle due to photon emission. For the fields typical for accelerator facilities, we find that an effective lifetime of the vortex state greatly exceeds the acceleration time. This proves that the acceleration of vortex electrons, ions, muons, and so forth to relativistic energies is possible in conventional linacs, as well as in the wake-field accelerators with higher field gradients, the OAM losses due to the photon emission are mostly negligible, and that the vortex quantum state is highly robust against these losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect, a hallmark of many-body physics, emerges from the antiferromagnetic coupling between localized spins and conduction fermions, leading to a correlated many-body singlet state. Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.</description>

Abstract: We show that a recent proposal for simulating planar hyperbolic lattices with circuit quantum electrodynamics can be extended to accommodate also higher dimensional lattices in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces if one allows for circuits with more than three polygons at each vertex. The quantum dynamics of these circuits, which can be constructed with present-day technology, are governed by effective tight-binding Hamiltonians corresponding to higher-dimensional Kagom\'{e}-like structures ($n$-dimensional zeolites), which are well known to exhibit strong frustration and flat bands. We analyze the relevant spectra of these systems and derive an exact expression for the fraction of flat-band states. Our results expand considerably the range of non-Euclidean geometry realizations with circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Quantum CSS Error-Correcting Codes via MacWilliams Identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of quantum stabilizer codes, one of the most important classes for practical implementations, on both symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels. To this aim, we first derive the weight enumerator (WE) for the undetectable errors based on the quantum MacWilliams identities. The WE is then used to evaluate tight upper bounds on the error rate of CSS quantum codes with \acl{MW} decoding. For surface codes we also derive a simple closed form expression of the bounds over the depolarizing channel. We introduce a novel approach that combines the knowledge of WE with a logical operator analysis, allowing the derivation of the exact asymptotic error rate for short codes. For example, on a depolarizing channel with physical error rate $\rho \to 0$, the logical error rate $\rho_\mathrm{L}$ is asymptotically $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16 \rho^2$ for the $[[9,1,3]]$ Shor code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 16.3 \rho^2$ for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code, $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 18.7 \rho^2$ for the $[[13,1,3]]$ surface code, and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 149.3 \rho^3$ for the $[[41,1,5]]$ surface code. For larger codes our bound provides $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 1215 \rho^4$ and $\rho_\mathrm{L} \approx 663 \rho^5$ for the $[[85,1,7]]$ and the $[[181,1,10]]$ surface codes, respectively. Finally, we extend our analysis to include realistic, noisy syndrome extraction circuits by modeling error propagation throughout gadgets. This enables estimation of logical error rates under faulty measurements. The performance analysis serves as a design tool for developing fault-tolerant quantum systems by guiding the selection of quantum codes based on their error correction capability. Additionally, it offers a novel perspective on quantum degeneracy, showing it represents the fraction of non-correctable error patterns shared by multiple logical operators.</description>

Abstract: Building large-scale quantum communication networks has its unique challenges. Here, we demonstrate that a network-wide synergistic usage of quantum memories distributed in a quantum communication network offers a fundamental advantage. We first map the problem of quantum communication with local usage of memories into a classical continuum percolation model. Then, we show that this mapping can be improved through a cooperation of quantum distillation and relay protocols via remote access to distributed memories. This improved mapping, which we term $\alpha$-percolation, can be formulated in terms of graph-merging rules, analogous to the decimation rules of the renormalization group treatment of disordered quantum magnets. These rules can be performed in any order, yielding the same optimal result that is characterized by the emergence of a ``positive feedback'' mechanism and the formation of spatially disconnected ``hopping'' communication components -- both marking significant improvements beyond the traditional point-to-point consideration of quantum communication in networked structures.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of out simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Stabilizer-based Entanglement Distillation Protocol for Qudits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement distillation, the process of converting weakly entangled states into maximally entangled ones using Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC), is pivotal for robust entanglement-assisted quantum information processing in error-prone environments. A construction based on stabilizer codes offers an effective method for designing such protocols. By analytically investigating the effective action of stabilizer protocols for systems of prime dimension $d$, we establish a standard form for the output states of recurrent stabilizer-based distillation. This links the properties of input states, stabilizers, and encodings to the properties of the protocol. Based on those insights, we present a novel two-copy distillation protocol, applicable to all bipartite states in prime dimension, that maximizes the fidelity increase per iteration for Bell-diagonal states. The power of this framework and the protocol is demonstrated through numerical investigations, which provide evidence for superior performance in terms of efficiency and distillability of low-fidelity states compared to other well-established recurrence protocols. By elucidating the interplay between states, errors, and protocols, our contribution advances the systematic development of highly effective distillation protocols, enhancing our understanding of distillability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled states of multiple qubits can violate Bell-type inequalities indicating nonlocal behavior of multiqubit quantum correlations. We analyze the relation between multipartite entanglement and genuine multipartite nonlocality, characterized by Svetlichny inequality violations, for two families of $N-$qubit states. We show that for the generalized GHZ family of states, Svetlichny inequality is not violated when the $n-$tangle is less than $1/2$ for any even number of qubits. On the other hand, the maximal slice states always violate the Svetlichny inequality when $n-$tangle is nonzero, and the violation increases monotonically with tangle. Our work generalizes the relations between tangle and Svetlichny inequality violations previously derived for three qubits.</description>

      <title>Universal adapters between quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the repetition code adapter as a way to perform joint logical Pauli measurements within a quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codeblock or between separate such codeblocks, thus providing a flexible tool for fault-tolerant computation with quantum LDPC codes. This adapter is universal in the sense that it works regardless of the LDPC codes involved and the logical Paulis being measured. The construction achieves joint logical Pauli measurement of $t$ weight $O(d)$ operators using $O(d)$ time and $\tilde O(td)$ additional qubits and checks, up to a factor polylogarithmic in $d$. As a special case, for some geometrically-local codes in fixed $D\ge2$ dimensions, only $O(td)$ additional qubits and checks are required instead. By extending the adapter in the case $t=2$, we also construct a toric code adapter that uses $O(d^2)$ additional qubits and checks to perform addressable logical CNOT gates on arbitrary LDPC codes via Dehn twists. To obtain these results, we develop a novel weaker form of graph edge expansion and the $\mathsf{SkipTree}$ algorithm, which ensures a sparse transformation between different weight-2 check bases for the classical repetition code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient dynamics of copropagating entangled bosons and fermions remains an unexplored aspect of quantum mechanics. We investigate how entanglement affects the spatiotemporal evolution of the particles using a modified version of the quantum shutter model. We derive a transient concurrence to characterize momentum-space entanglement, and show that it modulates the interference correlation of the joint probability density, allowing us to visualize the active regions where probabilistic bunching and antibunching phenomena emerge. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions that reveal a direct connection between entanglement and the characteristic oscillations of the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, highlighting the modulation of the phenomenon by quantum concurrence. This work introduces a temporal indicator of entanglement for a system of two coherent copropagating modes establishing a direct relationship with HBT-type interference patterns, providing a theoretical framework to explore the manifestation of entanglement in transient regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementing the time evolution under a desired target Hamiltonian is critical for various applications in quantum science. Due to the exponential increase in the number of parameters with system size and experimental imperfections, this task can be challenging in quantum many-body settings.
  We introduce an efficient and robust scheme to engineer arbitrary local many-body Hamiltonians. To this end, our scheme applies single-qubit $\pi$ or $\pi/2$ pulses to an always-on system Hamiltonian, which we assume to be native to a given platform. These sequences are constructed by efficiently solving a linear program (LP) which minimizes the total evolution time. In this way, we can engineer target Hamiltonians that are only limited by the locality of the interactions in the system Hamiltonian. Based on average Hamiltonian theory and using robust composite pulses, we make our schemes robust against errors, including finite pulse time errors and various control errors.
  To demonstrate the performance of our scheme, we provide numerical simulations. In particular, we solve the Hamiltonian engineering problem on a laptop for arbitrary two-local Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice with $196$ qubits in only $60$ seconds. Moreover, we simulate the engineering of general Heisenberg Hamiltonians from Ising Hamiltonians using imperfect single-qubit pulses for smaller system sizes and achieve a fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$, which is orders of magnitude better than non-robust implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently uploading data into quantum states is essential for many quantum algorithms to achieve advantage across various applications. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a method to upload a polynomial function $f(x)$ on the interval $x \in [-1,1]$ into a pure quantum state consisting of qubits, where a discretized $f(x)$ is the amplitude of this state. The preparation cost has $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ scaling in the number of qubits $n$ and linear scaling with the degree of the polynomial $Q$. This efficiency allows the preparation of states whose amplitudes correspond to high-degree polynomials (up to $10^4$), enabling accurate approximation of functions that admit efficient polynomial series representations and whose amplitude profiles are not extremely localized. We provide a fully explicit circuit realization, based on four real polynomials that meet specific parity and boundedness conditions. We extend this construction to cover piece-wise polynomial functions, a case not previously addressed explicitly in the literature, the algorithm scaling linearly with the number of piecewise parts. Our method achieves efficient quantum circuit implementation and we present detailed gate counting and resource analysis.</description>

Abstract: Here we present a technique for using machine learning (ML) for single-qubit gate synthesis on field programmable logic for a superconducting transmon-based quantum computer based on simulated studies. Our approach is multi-stage. We first bootstrap a model based on simulation with access to the full statevector for measuring gate fidelity. We next present an algorithm, named adapted randomized benchmarking (ARB), for fine-tuning the gate on hardware based on measurements of the devices. We also present techniques for deploying the model on programmable devices with care to reduce the required resources. While the techniques here are applied to a transmon-based computer, many of them are portable to other architectures.</description>

Abstract: Tremendous progress in experimental quantum optics during the past decades enabled the advent of quantum technologies, one of which is quantum communication. Aimed at novel methods for more secure or efficient information transfer, quantum communication has developed into an active field of research and proceeds toward full-scale implementations and industrialization. Continuous-variable methods of multi-photon quantum state preparation, manipulation, and coherent detection, as well as the respective theoretical tools of phase-space quantum optics, offer the possibility to make quantum communication efficient, applicable and accessible, thus boosting the development of the field. We review the methodology, techniques and protocols of continuous-variable quantum communication, from the first theoretical ideas, through milestone implementations, to the recent developments, covering quantum key distribution as well as other quantum communication schemes, suggested on the basis of continuous-variable states and measurements.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a quantum metrological protocol operating in a non-Markovian environment by employing the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model, in which the system is linearly coupled to a reservoir of harmonic oscillators. Specifically, we use a position-momentum (PM) correlated Gaussian state as a probe to examine how memory effects influence the evolution of the system's covariance matrix in the weak coupling regime under both high- and low-temperature conditions. To confirm the presence of non-Markovian behavior, we apply two well-established non-Markovianity quantifiers. Furthermore, we estimate both the channel's sample temperature and its non-Markovianity witness parameter. Our results demonstrate that non-Markovianity and PM correlations can jointly be valuable resources to enhance metrological performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algebraic geometry-inspired approach for constructing entangled subspaces within the Hilbert space of a multipartite quantum system. Specifically, our method employs a modified Veronese embedding, restricted to the conic, to define subspaces within the symmetric part of the Hilbert space. By utilizing this technique, we construct the minimal-dimensional, non-orthogonal yet Unextendible Product Basis (nUPB), enabling the decomposition of the multipartite Hilbert space into a two-dimensional subspace, complemented by a Genuinely Entangled Subspace (GES) and a maximal-dimensional Completely Entangled Subspace (CES). In multiqudit systems, we determine the maximum achievable dimension of a symmetric GES and demonstrate its realization through this construction. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the transition from the conventional Veronese embedding to the modified one by imposing various constraints on the affine coordinates, which, in turn, increases the CES dimension while reducing that of the GES.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data encoding plays a fundamental and distinctive role in Quantum Machine Learning (QML). While classical approaches process data directly as vectors, QML may require transforming classical data into quantum states through encoding circuits, known as quantum feature maps or quantum embeddings. This step leverages the inherently high-dimensional and non-linear nature of Hilbert space, enabling more efficient data separation in complex feature spaces that may be inaccessible to classical methods. This encoding part significantly affects the performance of the QML model, so it is important to choose the right encoding method for the dataset to be encoded. However, this choice is generally arbitrary, since there is no "universal" rule for knowing which encoding to choose based on a specific set of data. There are currently a variety of encoding methods using different quantum logic gates. We studied the most commonly used types of encoding methods and benchmarked them using different datasets.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points. We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of giant atoms goes beyond the local interaction paradigm in the conventional quantum optics, and predicts novel phenomena, such as oscillating bound states in the continuum (BICs) and decoherence-free interaction (DFI) that do not exist in small atoms, for some particular parameter settings of coupling positions and strengths. However, in the realistic experiments to implement giant-atom systems, there is always some level of disorder both in coupling positions and strengths. In this work, we investigate the effects of disorder on the phenomena related to giant atoms. We find that the giant-atom related phenomena are robust to both disorders of coupling positions and strengths in the Markovian regime, but more sensitive to the disorder of coupling positions in the non-Markovian regime. Our work shows that, to observe the non-Markovian phenomenon such as (oscillating) BICs in giant-atom systems, more precision is needed to control the disorder of coupling positions than that of the coupling strengths in the experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the realization of inline quantum measurements with waveguide-integrated superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). To suppress parasitic scattering at detector terminations, while ensuring compatibility with standard photonic substrates and cryogenic operation, we developed a photonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) platform based on etchless polymer waveguides. We show BIC-coupled inline detectors with on-chip efficiency exceeding 80%, recovery time of less than 2 ns, and intrinsic jitter of less than 70 ps. As a proof of principle, we implement Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry and photon number resolution with two collinear detectors within a footprint of $60 \cdot 6$ $\mu m^2$. The concept of inline quantum measurements could be further developed to support more complex circuit functionalities, such as higher-order correlation measurements, quantum state tomography, and multi-photon subtraction, within a compact architecture.</description>

      <title>Certifying asymmetry in the configuration of three qubits</title>

Abstract: Symmetry restrictions limit the types of tasks that can be achieved with a given set of quantum states. Therefore, any breaking of these symmetries could potentially be exploited as a resource for quantum communication. Here we demonstrate this operationally by certifying asymmetry in the configuration of the Bloch vectors of a set of three unknown qubit states within the dimensionally bounded prepare-and-measure scenario. To do this, we construct a linear witness from three simpler witnesses as building blocks, each featuring, along with two binary measurement settings, three preparations; two of them are associated with the certification task, while the third one serves as an auxiliary. The final witness is chosen to self-test some target configuration. We numerically derive a bound $Q_{\text{mirror}}$ for any mirror-symmetric configuration, thereby certifying asymmetry if this bound is exceeded (e.g. experimentally) for the unknown qubit configuration. We also consider the gap $(Q_{\text{max}}-Q_{\text{mirror}})$ between the analytically derived overall quantum maximum $Q_{\text{max}}$ and the mirror-symmetric bound, and use it as a quantifier of asymmetry in the target configuration. Numerical optimization shows that the most asymmetric configuration then forms a right scalene triangle on the unit Bloch sphere. Finally, we implement our protocol on a public quantum processor, where a clear violation of the mirror-symmetric bound certifies asymmetry in the configuration of our experimental triple of qubit states.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Adiabatic Elimination in Atom-Cavity Systems and Its Impact on Spin-Squeezing Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-squeezed states are metrologically useful quantum states where entanglement allows for enhanced sensing with respect to the standard quantum limit. Key challenges include the efficient preparation of spin-squeezed states and the scalability of estimation precision with the number $N$ of probes. Recently, in the context of the generation of spin-squeezed states via coupling of three-level atoms to an optical cavity, it was shown that increasing the atom-cavity coupling can be detrimental to spin squeezing generation, an effect that is not captured by the standard second-order adiabatic cavity removal approximation. We describe adiabatic elimination techniques to derive an effective Lindblad master equation up to third order for the atomic degrees of freedom. Numerical simulations show that the spin squeezing scalability loss is correctly reproduced by the reduced open system dynamics, highlighting the role of higher-order contributions. Furthermore, we conjecture an extension beyond leading order of the adiabatic elimination technique to the case of conditional dynamics under quantum non-demolition continuous measurement and fast cavity loss, whose reliability is again confirmed by numerical simulation of the dynamics and the corresponding behavior of spin squeezing as a function of $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trapping and cooling of photon gases in microcavities has been used to create Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the conditions required for condensation in dye-filled microcavities, with photon populations created either by driving a transition of the dye, or by coupling the cavity modes to a thermal photon reservoir such as sunlight. We find that the threshold pump temperature, above which condensation appears, is determined by the second law of thermodynamics. The minimum achievable threshold is that of a reversible three-level heat engine, which we show arises in the dye-pumped case, and for pumping of the modes of a two-level cavity. For a many-level cavity condensation occurs at a similar but higher temperature. Our results show that photon condensates can be produced by pumping with incoherent thermal sources, opening possibilities for coherent light generation, energy harvesting, and experimental studies of quantum heat engines.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Boltzmann machines (QBMs) are generative models with potential advantages in quantum machine learning, yet their training is fundamentally limited by the barren plateau problem, where gradients vanish exponentially with system size. We introduce a quantum version of the em algorithm, an information-geometric generalization of the classical Expectation-Maximization method, which circumvents gradient-based optimization on non-convex functions. Implemented on a semi-quantum restricted Boltzmann machine (sqRBM) -- a hybrid architecture with quantum effects confined to the hidden layer -- our method achieves stable learning and outperforms gradient descent on multiple benchmark datasets. These results establish a structured and scalable alternative to gradient-based training in QML, offering a pathway to mitigate barren plateaus and enhance quantum generative modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Basic quantum effects are often illustrated using single particle interferences in two-path interferometers. A wider range of non-classical phenomena can be illustrated using three-path interferometers, but the increased complexity of quantum statistics in a three-dimensional Hilbert space makes it difficult to identify a representative set of observable properties that could be used to characterize specific phenomena. Here, I propose a characterization of pure states based on a five-stage interferometer recently introduced to demonstrate the relation between different measurement contexts (Optica Quantum 1, 63 (2023)). It is shown that the orthogonality relations between the states representing the different measurement contexts can be used to classify pure states within the three-dimensional Hilbert space according to the non-classical correlations between different contexts expressed by negative Kirkwood-Dirac distributions.</description>

      <title>Stoquasticity is not enough: towards a sharper diagnostic for Quantum Monte Carlo simulability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, yet their applicability is limited by the infamous sign problem. We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Magnetic noise in macroscopic quantum spatial superposition induced by inverted harmonic oscillator potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a Stern-Gerlach type matter-wave interferometer where an inhomogeneous magnetic field couples to an embedded spin in a nanoparticle to create spatial superpositions. Employing a sequence of harmonic and inverted harmonic oscillator potentials created by external magnetic fields, we aim to enhance the one-dimensional superposition of a nanodiamond with mass $\sim 10^{-15}$ kg to $\sim 1 \mu$m. However, random fluctuations of the magnetic field stochastically perturbs the interferometer paths and induce dephasing. We quantitatively estimate the susceptibility of the interferometer to white noise arising from magnetic-field fluctuations. Constraining the dephasing rate \(\Gamma\) to be low enough that the final coherence \(e^{-\Gamma \tau}\leq 0.1\) (where \(\tau\) is the experimental time duration), we obtain the following bounds on the noise to signal ratios: $\delta \eta_\text{IHP}/\eta_\text{IHP}\lesssim 10^{-13}$, where $\eta_\text{IHP}$ is the magnetic field curvature that gives rise to the inverted harmonic potential, and $\delta \eta_\text{HP}/\eta_\text{HP}\lesssim 10^{-6}$, where $\eta_\text{HP}$ is the linear magnetic field gradient that gives rise to the harmonic potential. For such tiny fluctuations, we demonstrate that the Humpty-Dumpty problem arising from a mismatch in position and momentum does not cause a loss in contrast of the interferometer. Further, we show that constraining the dephasing rate leads to stricter bounds on the noise parameters than enforcing a contrast threshold, indicating that good dephasing control ensures high interferometric contrast.</description>

      <title>Measuring Multiparticle Indistinguishability with the Generalized Bunching Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04550v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The indistinguishability of many bosons undergoing passive linear transformations followed by number basis measurements is fully characterized by the visible state of the bosons. However, measuring all the parameters in the visible state is experimentally demanding. In this work, we seek to perform partial characterization of the visible state by measuring properties of it that are available after randomization. First we study the case where the occupied visible modes are randomly permuted, and second we study the case where Haar random linear optical unitaries are applied. In each case, we find that the generalized bunching probability -- which is the probability that all the input bosons arrive in a given subset of the output modes -- obeys monotonicity with respect to some partial order of distinguishability of the input bosons. As an intermediate result, we show that Lieb's permanental-dominance conjecture for immanants is equivalent to the following statement: for states that are invariant under permutations of the occupied visible modes, the generalized bunching probability is maximized when the bosons are perfectly indistinguishable. We also prove that a consequence of the monotonicity of the generalized bunching probability after Haar averaging is that this average is maximized when the bosons are perfectly indistinguishable. Finally, we discuss applications of our results to thermometry of cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Diffraction by Circular and Triangular Apertures as a Diagnostic Tool of Twisted Matter Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study diffraction of twisted matter waves (electrons and light ions carrying orbital angular momentum $\ell/\hbar=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots$ by circular and triangular apertures. Within the scalar Kirchhoff-Fresnel framework, circular apertures preserve cylindrical symmetry and produce ringlike far-field profiles whose radii and widths depend on $|\ell|$ but are insensitive to its sign. In contrast, equilateral triangles break axial symmetry and yield structured patterns that encode both the magnitude and the sign of $\ell$. A transparent Fraunhofer mapping links detector coordinates to the Fourier plane, explaining the $(|\ell|+1)$-lobe rule and the sign-dependent rotation of the pattern. We validate these results for both ideal Bessel beams and localized Laguerre-Gaussian packets, and we cross-check them by split-step Fourier propagation of the time-dependent Schr"odinger equation. From these analyses we extract practical design rules (Fraunhofer distance, lattice pitch, detector sampling) relevant to OAM diagnostics with moderately relativistic electrons with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $5$ MeV and light ions with $E_{\rm kin}\sim0.1$ to $1$ MeV/u. Our results establish triangular diffraction as a simple, passive, and robust method for reading out the OAM content of structured quantum beams.</description>

      <title>Good quantum codes with addressable and parallelizable transversal non-Clifford gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we prove that for any $m&gt;1$, there exists a family of good qudit quantum codes supporting transversal logical $\mathsf{C}^{m-1}\mathsf{Z}$ gates that can address specified logical qudits and be largely executed in parallel. Building on the family of good quantum error-correcting codes presented in He et al. (2025), which support addressable and transversal logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, we extend their framework and show how to perform large sets of gates in parallel. The construction relies on the classical algebraic geometry codes of Stichtenoth (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2006). Our results lead to a substantial reduction in the depth overhead of multi-control-$Z$ circuits. In particular, we show that the minimal depth of any logical $\mathsf{C}^{m-1}\mathsf{Z}$ circuit involving qudits from $m$ distinct code blocks is upper bounded by $O(k^{m-1})$, where $k$ is the code dimension. While this overhead is optimal for dense $\mathsf{C}^{m-1}\mathsf{Z}$ circuits, for sparse circuits we discuss how the depth overhead can be significantly reduced by exploiting the structure of the quantum code.</description>

Abstract: We construct an important missing piece in the entanglement theory of pure three-qubit states, which is a polynomial measure of W-entanglement, working in parallel to the three-tangle, which is a polynomial measure of GHZ-entanglement, and to the bipartite concurrence, which is a polynomial measure of bipartite entanglement. We also show that these entanglement measures are ordered, the bipartite measure is larger than the W measure, which is larger than the GHZ measure. It is meaningful then to consider these three types of three-qubit entanglement, which are also ordered, bipartite is weaker than W, which is weaker than GHZ, in parallel to the order of the three equivalence classes of entangled three-qubit states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of quantum resource degradation grounded in a decomposition of observational entropy, which partitions the total resource into inter-block coherence ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$) and intra-block noise ($\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$). Under free operations, the total quantum resource is transformed into classical noise while its overall quantity remains conserved. We demonstrate that the metric $\eta$ functions as a diagnostic indicator, providing a new lens on optimization stagnation, particularly the barren plateau phenomenon (BPP) in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). We substantiate this framework through rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, and we explore how these channels can be physically implemented in real quantum systems. Our approach offers a unified viewpoint on quantum thermalization, measurement-induced disturbance, and the degradation of quantum advantage in practical devices, while also improving optimization strategies for current and near-term noisy quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Learnability Transition of Measurement-Induced Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) captures how local measurements generate long-range quantum correlations and drive dynamical phase transitions in many-body systems. Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.</description>

      <title>F2: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Hamiltonian Simulation via Free-Fermionic Subroutine Compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction.
  We introduce F2, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data.
  Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47% and depth by 38% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of 10^(-7). These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation</description>

      <title>High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</description>

      <title>Quantum Brownian Motion as a Classical Stochastic Process in Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that the exact quantum dynamics of a Brownian particle in the Caldeira-Leggett model can be mapped, at any temperature, onto a classical, non-Markovian stochastic process in phase space. Starting from a correlated thermal equilibrium state between the particle and bath, we prove that this correspondence is exact for quadratic potentials under arbitrary quantum state preparations of the particle itself. For more general, smooth potentials, we identify and exploit a natural small parameter: the density matrix becomes strongly quasidiagonal in the coordinate representation, with its off-diagonal width shrinking as the bath's spectral cutoff increases, providing a controlled parameter for accurate approximation. The framework is fully general: arbitrary initial quantum states-including highly non-classical superpositions-are incorporated via their Wigner functions, which serve as statistical weights for trajectory ensembles. Furthermore, the formalism naturally accommodates external manipulations and measurements modeled by preparation functions acting at arbitrary times, enabling the simulation of complex driven-dissipative quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Optimizing Uniformly Controlled Structures in Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum unitaries of the form $\Sigma_{c}\ket{c}\bra{c}\otimes U_{c}$ are ubiquitous in quantum algorithms. This class encompasses not only standard uniformly controlled gates (UCGs) but also a wide range of circuits with uniformly controlled structures. However, their circuit-depth and gate-count complexities have not been systematically analyzed within a unified framework. In this work, we study the general decomposition problem for UCG and UCG-like structure. We then introduce the restricted Uniformly Controlled Gates (rUCGs) as a unified algebraic model, defined by a 2-divisible Abelian group that models the controlled gate set. This model captures uniformly controlled rotations, multi-qubit uniformly controlled gates, and diagonal unitaries. Furthermore, this model also naturally incorporates k-sparse version (k-rUCGs), where only a subset of control qubits participate in each multi-qubit gate. Building on this algebraic model, we develop a general framework. For an n-control rUCG, the framework reduce the gate complexity from ${O(n2^n)}$ to ${O(2^n})$ and the circuit depth from ${O(2^n\log n)}$ to ${O(2^n\log n/n)}$. The framework further provides systematic size and depth bounds for k-rUCGs by exploiting sparsity in the control space, with same optimization coefficient as rUCG, respectively. Empirical evaluations on representative QAOA circuits confirm reductions in depth and size, which highlight that the rUCG model and its associated decomposition framework unify circuits previously considered structurally distinct under a single, asymptotically optimal synthesis paradigm.</description>

      <title>Autonomous multi-ion optical clock with on-chip integrated photonic light delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated photonics in trapped-ion systems are critical for the realization of applications such as portable optical atomic clocks and scalable quantum computers. However, system-level integration of all required functionalities remains a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate an autonomously operating optical clock having a short-term frequency instability of $3.14(5)\times 10^{-14} / \sqrt{\tau}$ using an ensemble of four $^{171}\textrm{Yb}^{+}$ ions trapped in a multi-site surface-electrode trap at room temperature. All clock operations are performed with light delivered via on-chip waveguides. We showcase the system's resilience through sustained, autonomous operation featuring automated ion shuttling and reloading to mitigate ion loss during interleaved clock measurements. This work paves the way beyond component-level functionality to establish a viable and robust architecture for the next generation of portable, multi-ion quantum sensors and computers.</description>

      <title>Equiangular lines via matrix projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15842v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel posed the problem of determining the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$ with angle $\arccos(\alpha)$ and gave a partial answer in the regime $r \leq 1/\alpha^2 - 2$. At the other extreme where $r$ is at least exponential in $1/\alpha$, recent breakthroughs have led to an almost complete resolution of this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new method for obtaining upper bounds which unifies and improves upon previous approaches, thereby yielding bounds which bridge the gap between the aforementioned regimes and are best possible either exactly or up to a small multiplicative constant. Our approach relies on orthogonal projection of matrices with respect to the Frobenius inner product and as a byproduct, it yields the first extension of the Alon-Boppana theorem to dense graphs, with equality for strongly regular graphs corresponding to $\binom{r+1}{2}$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$. Applications of our method in the complex setting will be discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Emergent metric from wavelet-transformed quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method of reverse holography by which a bulk metric is shown to arise from locally computable multiscale correlations of a boundary quantum field theory (QFT). The metric is obtained from the Petz-R\'enyi mutual information defined with input correlations computed from the continuous wavelet transform. The method is applicable to a variety of boundary QFTs that need not be conformal field theories (CFTs). For thermal free scalar and Dirac field theories the resulting bulk metric is that of (asymmetrically) warped anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. For massless, ground state CFTs the geometry simply reduces to AdS space. We show that certain parameters of the geometry can be tuned by changing the shape of the wavelet function.</description>

      <title>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group to link different scales. We uncover a novel transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</description>

      <title>Thermal modifications of mesons and energy-energy correlators from real-time simulations of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal properties of a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1$-dimensions through real-time simulations. We extract the spectral functions directly coupling to the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons, demonstrating the thermal modifications of these states with increasing temperatures. Introducing the notion of energy-flow operators, we quantify the temporal build-up of correlations in the energy flows across the lattice. We demonstrate that energy-energy correlators fail to factorize to products of energy flows, both in the vacuum and at nonzero-temperature, indicating the presence of non-trivial correlations in the quantum states. Our results constitute a first real-time \textit{ab-initio} study of bound state thermal broadening and finite temperature energy-flow correlations in a gauge theory, providing a benchmark for future studies of hadronic matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current models of quantum interference experiments in external gravitational fields lack a common framework: while matter-wave interferometers are commonly described using the Schr\"odinger equation with a Newtonian potential, gravitational effects in quantum optics are modeled using either post-Newtonian metrics or highly symmetric exact solutions to Einstein's field equations such as those of Schwarzschild and Kerr. To coherently describe both kinds of experiments, this paper develops a unified framework for modeling quantum interferometers in general stationary space-times. This model provides a rigorous description and coherent interpretation of the effects of classical gravity on quantum probes.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamond: Size, Depth, and Surroundings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provides a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass from a Constant Magnetic Field and Boundary Conditions in Coupled Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Energy Ising Machine Leveraging Difference-of-Convex Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as finding the ground state of the Ising model. Existing Ising solvers are mostly inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose solving the Ising problem by relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing an attraction potential that steers the solution toward binary spin configurations. A key property of this potential is that its combination with the Ising energy produces a Hamiltonian that can be written as a difference of convex polynomials. This enables us to design efficient iterative algorithms that require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and provide convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver on a wide range of GPU platforms, from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).</description>

Abstract: In this work, based on an analogy of holographic confining geometries and using complexified fields, we build the holographic toy model of third order photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings with gain and loss, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, in our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We also discuss the connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a second-order EP in a perturbed $\theta$-vacuum model.</description>

      <title>Group Representations of Lorentz Transformations Extended to Superluminal Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an extension of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group that includes space-time transformations for observers moving with superluminal relative velocities in arbitrary direction. This extension is generated by a realization of the Klein four group depending on polar and azimuthal angles identifying a spatial direction and is obtained with matrices representing infinite velocity limits of superluminal Lorentz boosts. The resulting group has the same identity component of the whole Lorentz group O(3,1) but involutive operators corresponding to an infinite speed boost and its negative in place of parity and time reversal. Different spatial directions in the definition of Klein group realization give rise to equivalent group extensions. We then define the extended Poincare group including translations and classify its unitary irreducible representations (UIRs). The resulting UIRs are induced from Wigner's UIRs of standard Poincare group and depend on the action of the extended Lorentz group defined on momentum space. UIRs corresponding to non lightlike orbits restrict to the ordinary Poincare subgroup as a multiplicity one direct sum of a massive forward, a massive backward and a tachyonic Wigner UIR while for lightlike orbits as two inequivalent direct sum representations combiningh linearly a forward and backward massless Wigner UIR. We then derive wave equations corresponding to solutions of the Casimir eigenvalue problem of Poincare algebra obtained differentiating the above representations. This set of equations contains all the wave equations known to date in quantum field theory together with new wave equations describing tachyonic behaviour and a new class of massless representations. We finally show that tachyonic wave functions provide a relevant representation theoretic tool for interpretation of parity violation phenomena in quantum field theory</description>

Abstract: Breaking optical reciprocity enables new regimes of light--matter interaction with broad implications for fundamental physics and emerging quantum technologies. Although various approaches have been explored to achieve optical nonreciprocity, realizing it at the single-photon level has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate nonmagnetic optical nonreciprocity -- including both isolation and circulation -- in the quantum regime, enabled by efficient and noiseless all-optical frequency conversion on an integrated III-V photonic chip. Our device preserves the quantum coherence and entanglement of the input photons while delivering exceptional performance parameters, including a high extinction ratio of 34 dB, low insertion loss of 0.8 dB, broad bandwidth of 44 GHz, high operational fidelity of 97%, and widely tunable operation wavelength. This realization of quantum optical nonreciprocity in a scalable photonic platform opens a pathway toward directional quantum communication and noise-resilient quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01263</link>

Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</description>
