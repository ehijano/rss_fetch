      <title>The Magnitude of Categories of Texts Enriched by Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is twofold. Firstly, we use the next-token probabilities given by a language model to explicitly define a $[0,1]$-enrichment of a category of texts in natural language, in the sense of Bradley, Terilla, and Vlassopoulos. We consider explicitly the terminating conditions for text generation and determine when the enrichment itself can be interpreted as a probability over texts. Secondly, we compute the M\"obius function and the magnitude of an associated generalized metric space $\mathcal{M}$ of texts using a combinatorial version of these quantities recently introduced by Vigneaux. The magnitude function $f(t)$ of $\mathcal{M}$ is a sum over texts $x$ (prompts) of the Tsallis $t$-entropies of the next-token probability distributions $p(-|x)$ plus the cardinality of the model's possible outputs. The derivative of $f$ at $t=1$ recovers a sum of Shannon entropies, which justifies seeing magnitude as a partition function. Following Leinster and Schulman, we also express the magnitude function of $\mathcal M$ as an Euler characteristic of magnitude homology and provide an explicit description of the zeroeth and first magnitude homology groups.</description>

      <title>On the axiomatisability of the dual of compact ordered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the category of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces and order-preserving continuous maps between them is dually equivalent to a variety of algebras, with operations of at most countable arity. Furthermore, we show that the countable bound on the arity is the best possible: the category of compact ordered spaces is not dually equivalent to any variety of finitary algebras. Indeed, the following stronger results hold: the category of compact ordered spaces is not dually equivalent to (i) any finitely accessible category, (ii) any first-order definable class of structures, (iii) any class of finitary algebras closed under products and subalgebras. An explicit equational axiomatisation of the dual of the category of compact ordered spaces is obtained; in fact, we provide a finite one, meaning that our description uses only finitely many function symbols and finitely many equational axioms. In preparation for the latter result, we establish a generalisation of a celebrated theorem by D. Mundici: our result asserts that the category of unital commutative distributive lattice-ordered monoids is equivalent to the category of what we call MV-monoidal algebras. Our proof is independent of Mundici's theorem.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional generalization of abelian categories via DG Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce abelian $(n,1)$-categories as an $n$-dimensional analog of abelian categories, where for \( n=1 \), it corresponds to ordinary abelian categories, and for \( n=\infty \), it represents stable DG-categories. We demonstrate that their homotopy categories become extriangulated categories and pretriangulated categories, and we establish a general theory of abelian $(n,1)$-categories. For example, the analog of the existance epi-mono factorizations of morphisms in abelian categories.</description>

      <title>Tate modules as condensed modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the category of countable Tate modules over an arbitrary discrete ring embeds fully faithfully into that of condensed modules. If the base ring is of finite type, we characterize the essential image as generated by the free module of infinite countable rank under direct sums, duals and retracts. In the $\infty$-categorical context, we establish a fully faithful embedding of the $\infty$-category of countable Tate objects in perfect complexes, with uniformly bounded tor-amplitude, into the derived $\infty$-category of condensed modules. The boundedness assumption is necessary to ensure fullness, as we prove via an explicit counterexample in the unbounded case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We verify a conjecture of Etingof and Ostrik, stating that an algebra object in a finite tensor category is exact if and only if it is a finite direct product of simple algebras. Towards that end, we introduce an analogue of the Jacobson radical of an algebra object, similar to the Jacobson radical of a finite-dimensional algebra. We give applications of our main results in the context of incompressible finite symmetric tensor categories.</description>

      <title>Toric Mirror Symmetry for Homotopy Theorists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct functors sending torus-equivariant quasi-coherent sheaves on toric schemes over the sphere spectrum to constructible sheaves of spectra on real vector spaces. This provides a spectral lift of the toric homolgoical mirror symmetry theorem of Fang-Liu-Treumann-Zaslow (arXiv:1007.0053). Along the way, we obtain symmetric monoidal structures and functoriality results concerning those functors, which are new even over a field $k$. We also explain how the `non-equivariant' version of the theorem would follow from this functoriality via the de-equivariantization technique. As a concrete application, we obtain an alternative proof of Beilinson's linear algebraic description of quasi-coherent sheaves on projective spaces with spectral coefficients.</description>

      <title>Left reductive regular semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an ideal structure theory for the class of left reductive regular semigroups and apply it to several subclasses of popular interest. In these classes, we observe that the right ideal structure of the semigroup is `embedded' inside the left ideal one, and so we can construct these semigroups starting with only one object (unlike in other more general cases). To this end, we introduce an upgraded version of the Nambooripad's normal category \cite{cross} as our building block, which we call a \emph{connected category}.
  The main theorem of the paper describes a category equivalence between the category of left reductive regular semigroups and the category of {connected categories}. Then, we specialise our result to describe constructions of $\gl$-unipotent semigroups, right regular bands, inverse semigroups and arbitrary regular monoids. Exploiting the left-right duality of semigroups, we also construct right reductive regular semigroups and use that to describe the more particular subclasses of $\gr$-unipotent semigroups and left regular bands. Finally, we provide concrete (and rather simple) descriptions to the connected categories that arise from finite transformation semigroups, linear transformation semigroups (over a finite dimensional vector space) and symmetric inverse monoids.</description>

      <title>Species of Rota-Baxter algebras by rooted trees, twisted bialgebras and Fock functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a fundamental and ubiquitous combinatorial notion, species has attracted sustained interest, generalizing from set-theoretical combinatorial to algebraic combinatorial and beyond. The Rota-Baxter algebra is one of the algebraic structures with broad applications from Renormalization of quantum field theory to integrable systems and multiple zeta values. Its interpretation in terms of monoidal categories has also recently appeared. This paper studies species of Rota-Baxter algebras, making use of the combinatorial construction of free Rota-Baxter algebras in terms of angularly decorated trees and forests. The notion of simple angularly decorated forests is introduced for this purpose and the resulting Rota-Baxter species is shown to be free. Furthermore, a twisted bialgebra structure, as the bialgebra for species, is established on this free Rota-Baxter species. Finally, through the Fock functor, another proof of the bialgebra structure on free Rota-Baxter algebras is obtained.</description>

      <title>Relative quasi-Gorensteinness in extriangulated categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s})$ be an extriangulated category with a proper class $\xi$ of $\mathbb{E}$-triangles. In this paper, we study the quasi-Gorensteinness of extriangulated categories. More precisely, we introduce the notion of quasi-$\xi$-projective and quasi-$\xi$-Gorenstein projective objects, investigate some of their properties and their behavior with respect to $\mathbb{E}$-triangles. Moreover, we give some equivalent characterizations of objects with finite quasi-$\xi$-Gorenstein projective dimension. As an application, our main results generalize Mashhad and Mohammadi's work in module categories.</description>

      <title>Non-additive derived functors via chain resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F\colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{E}$ be a functor from a category $\mathcal{C}$ to a homological (Borceux-Bourn) or semi-abelian (Janelidze-M\'arki-Tholen) category $\mathcal{E}$. We investigate conditions under which the homology of an object $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ with coefficients in the functor $F$, defined via projective resolutions in $\mathcal{C}$, remains independent of the chosen resolution. Consequently, the left derived functors of $F$ can be constructed analogously to the classical abelian case.
  Our approach extends the concept of chain homotopy to a non-additive setting using the technique of imaginary morphisms. Specifically, we utilize the approximate subtractions of Bourn-Janelidze, originally introduced in the context of subtractive categories. This method is applicable when $\mathcal{C}$ is a pointed regular category with finite coproducts and enough projectives, provided the class of projectives is closed under protosplit subobjects, a new condition introduced in this article and naturally satisfied in the abelian context. We further assume that the functor $F$ meets certain exactness conditions: for instance, it may be protoadditive and preserve proper morphisms and binary coproducts - conditions that amount to additivity when $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are abelian categories.
  Within this framework, we develop a basic theory of derived functors, compare it with the simplicial approach, and provide several examples.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we further the study of arrow algebras, simple algebraic structures inducing toposes through the tripos-to-topos construction, by defining appropriate notions of morphisms between them which correspond to morphisms of the associated triposes. Specializing to geometric inclusions, we characterize subtriposes of an arrow tripos in terms of nuclei on the underlying arrow algebra, recovering a classical locale-theoretic result. As an example of application, we lift modified realizability to the setting of arrow algebras, and we establish its functoriality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08515v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the formal theory of monads, as established by Street, in univalent foundations. This allows us to formally reason about various kinds of monads on the right level of abstraction. In particular, we define the bicategory of monads internal to a bicategory, and prove that it is univalent. We also define Eilenberg-Moore objects, and we show that both Eilenberg-Moore categories and Kleisli categories give rise to Eilenberg-Moore objects. Finally, we relate monads and adjunctions in arbitrary bicategories. Our work is formalized in Coq using the UniMath library.</description>

      <title>Categorical Quantum Groups and Braided Monoidal 2-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the theory of principal $\infty$-bundles of Niklaus-Schreiber-Steveson, we develop a homotopy categorification of Hopf algebras, which model quantum groups. We study their higher-representation theory in the setting of $\mathsf{2Vect}^{hBC}$, which is a homotopy refinement of the notion of 2-vector spaces of Baez-Crans that allows for higher coherence data. We construct in particular the \textit{2-quantum double} as a homotopy bicrossed product {\'a} la Majid, and prove its duality and factorization properties. We also define and characterize "{2-$R$-matrices}" universally, which can be seen as an extension of the usual notion of $R$-matrix in an ordinary quantum group. We found that the 2-Yang-Baxter equations describe the braiding of extended defects in 4d, similar to the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equations. The main results we prove in this paper is that the 2-representation 2-category of a weak 2-bialgebra is braided monoidal if and only if it is equipped with a universal 2-$R$-matrix, and that our homotopy quantization admits the theory of Lie 2-bialgebras as a semiclassical limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper establishes an equivalence between directed homotopy categories of (diagrams of) cubical sets and (diagrams of) directed topological spaces. This equivalence both lifts and extends an equivalence between classical homotopy categories of cubical sets and topological spaces. Some simple applications include combinatorial descriptions and subsequent calculations of directed homotopy monoids and directed singular $1$-cohomology monoids. Another application is a characterization of isomorphisms between small categories up to zig-zags of natural transformations as directed homotopy equivalences between directed classifying spaces. Cubical sets throughout the paper are taken to mean presheaves over the minimal symmetric monoidal variant of the cube category. Along the way, the paper characterizes morphisms in this variant as the interval-preserving lattice homomorphisms between finite Boolean lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups from the perspective of homological algebra. We extend to this context the type-decomposition of locally compact Polish abelian groups of Hoffmann and Spitzweck, and prove that the category $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups is a thick subcategory of the category of Polish abelian groups. We completely characterize injective and projective objects in $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$. We conclude that $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ has enough projectives but not enough injectives and homological dimension $1$. We also completely characterize injective and projective objects in the category of non-Archimedean Polish abelian groups, concluding that it has enough injectives and projectives and homological dimension $1$. Injective objects are also characterized for the categories of topological torsion Polish abelian groups and for Polish abelian topological $p$-groups, showing that these categories have enough injectives and homological dimension $1$.</description>

      <title>Identity-Preserving Lax Extensions and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic notions of bisimulation for various types of systems (nondeterministic, probabilistic, weighted etc.) rely on identity-preserving (normal) lax extensions of the functor encapsulating the system type, in the paradigm of universal coalgebra. It is known that preservation of weak pullbacks is a sufficient condition for a functor to admit a normal lax extension (the Barr extension, which in fact is then even strict); in the converse direction, nothing is currently known about necessary (weak) pullback preservation conditions for the existence of normal lax extensions. In the present work, we narrow this gap by showing on the one hand that functors admitting a normal lax extension preserve 1/4-iso pullbacks, i.e. pullbacks in which at least one of the projections is an isomorphism. On the other hand, we give sufficient conditions, showing that a functor admits a normal lax extension if it weakly preserves either 1/4-iso pullbacks and 4/4-epi pullbacks (i.e. pullbacks in which all morphisms are epic) or inverse images. We apply these criteria to concrete examples, in particular to functors modelling neighbourhood systems and weighted systems.</description>
