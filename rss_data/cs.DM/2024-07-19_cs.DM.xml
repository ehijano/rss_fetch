      <title>The Storage Location Assignment and Picker Routing Problem: A Generic Branch-Cut-and-Price Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP) and the Picker Routing Problem (PRP) have received significant attention in the literature due to their pivotal role in the performance of the Order Picking (OP) activity, the most resource-intensive process of warehousing logistics. The two problems are traditionally considered at different decision-making levels: tactical for the SLAP, and operational for the PRP. However, this paradigm has been challenged by the emergence of modern practices in e-commerce warehouses, where storage decisions are more dynamic and are made at an operational level, making the integration of the SLAP and PRP pertinent to consider. Despite its practical significance, the joint optimization of both operations, called the Storage Location Assignment and Picker Routing Problem (SLAPRP), has received limited attention. Scholars have investigated several variants of the SLAPRP, including different warehouse layouts and routing policies. Nevertheless, the available computational results suggest that each variant requires an ad hoc formulation. Moreover, achieving a complete integration of the two problems, where the routing is solved optimally, remains out of reach for commercial solvers.
  In this paper, we propose an exact solution framework that addresses a broad class of variants of the SLAPRP, including all the previously existing ones. This paper proposes a Branch-Cut-and-Price framework based on a novel formulation with an exponential number of variables, which is strengthened with a novel family of non-robust valid inequalities. We have developed an ad-hoc branching scheme to break symmetries and maintain the size of the enumeration tree manageable. Computational experiments show that our framework can effectively solve medium-sized instances of several SLAPRP variants and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods from the literature.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order ($n$) and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree, even girth $g$ ($\geq 4$), and number of cycles of length $g$ passing through a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of the Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding reasonably tight lower bounds, which range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>

      <title>The discrepancy of the Champernowne constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number is normal in base $b$ if, in its base $b$ expansion, all blocks of digits of equal length have the same asymptotic frequency. The rate at which a number approaches normality is quantified by the classical notion of discrepancy, which indicates how far the scaling of the number by powers of $b$ is from being equidistributed modulo 1. This rate is known as the discrepancy of a normal number. The Champernowne constant $c_{10} = 0.12345678910111213141516\ldots$ is the most well-known example of a normal number. In 1986, Schiffer provided the discrepancy of numbers in a family that includes the Champernowne constant. His proof relies on exponential sums. Here, we present a discrete and elementary proof specifically for the discrepancy of the Champernowne constant.</description>

      <title>Solution Numbers for Eight Blocks to Madness Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 30 MacMahon colored cubes have each face painted with one of six colors and every color appears on at least one face. One puzzle involving these cubes is to create a $2\times2\times2$ model with eight distinct MacMahon cubes to recreate a larger version with the external coloring of a specified target cube, also a MacMahon cube, and touching interior faces are the same color. J.H. Conway is credited with arranging the cubes in a $6\times6$ tableau that gives a solution to this puzzle. In fact, the particular set of eight cubes that solves this puzzle can be arranged in exactly \textit{two} distinct ways to solve the puzzle. We study a less restrictive puzzle without requiring interior face matching. We describe solutions to the $2\times2\times2$ puzzle and the number of distinct solutions attainable for a collection of eight cubes. Additionally, given a collection of eight MacMahon cubes, we study the number of target cubes that can be built in a $2\times2\times2$ model. We calculate the distribution of the number of cubes that can be built over all collections of eight cubes (the maximum number is five) and provide a complete characterization of the collections that can build five distinct cubes. Furthermore, we identify nine new sets of twelve cubes, called Minimum Universal sets, from which all 30 cubes can be built.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>ABC(T)-graphs: an axiomatic characterization of the median procedure in graphs with connected and G$^2$-connected medians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The median function is a location/consensus function that maps any profile $\pi$ (a finite multiset of vertices) to the set of vertices that minimize the distance sum to vertices from $\pi$. The median function satisfies several simple axioms: Anonymity (A), Betweeness (B), and Consistency (C). McMorris, Mulder, Novick and Powers (2015) defined the ABC-problem for consensus functions on graphs as the problem of characterizing the graphs (called, ABC-graphs) for which the unique consensus function satisfying the axioms (A), (B), and (C) is the median function.
  In this paper, we show that modular graphs with $G^2$-connected medians (in particular, bipartite Helly graphs) are ABC-graphs. On the other hand, the addition of some simple local axioms satisfied by the median function in all graphs (axioms (T), and (T$_2$)) enables us to show that all graphs with connected median (comprising Helly graphs, median graphs, basis graphs of matroids and even $\Delta$-matroids) are ABCT-graphs and that benzenoid graphs are ABCT$_2$-graphs. McMorris et al (2015) proved that the graphs satisfying the pairing property (called the intersecting-interval property in their paper) are ABC-graphs. We prove that graphs with the pairing property constitute a proper subclass of bipartite Helly graphs and we discuss the complexity status of the recognition problem of such graphs.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Streaming Diameter and Connectivity Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the investigation of the parameterized complexity of Diameter and Connectivity in the streaming paradigm. On the positive end, we show that knowing a vertex cover of size $k$ allows for algorithms in the Adjacency List (AL) streaming model whose number of passes is constant and memory is $O(\log n)$ for any fixed $k$. Underlying these algorithms is a method to execute a breadth-first search in $O(k)$ passes and $O(k \log n)$ bits of memory. On the negative end, we show that many other parameters lead to lower bounds in the AL model, where $\Omega(n/p)$ bits of memory is needed for any $p$-pass algorithm even for constant parameter values. In particular, this holds for graphs with a known modulator (deletion set) of constant size to a graph that has no induced subgraph isomorphic to a fixed graph $H$, for most $H$. For some cases, we can also show one-pass, $\Omega(n \log n)$ bits of memory lower bounds. We also prove a much stronger $\Omega(n^2/p)$ lower bound for Diameter on bipartite graphs.
  Finally, using the insights we developed into streaming parameterized graph exploration algorithms, we show a new streaming kernelization algorithm for computing a vertex cover of size $k$. This yields a kernel of $2k$ vertices (with $O(k^2)$ edges) produced as a stream in $\text{poly}(k)$ passes and only $O(k \log n)$ bits of memory.</description>

      <title>Big Ramsey Degrees and Infinite Languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13116v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates big Ramsey degrees of unrestricted relational structures in (possibly) infinite languages. Despite significant progress in the study of big Ramsey degrees, the big Ramsey degrees of many classes of structures with finite small Ramsey degrees are still not well understood. We show that if there are only finitely many relations of every arity greater than one, then unrestricted relational structures have finite big Ramsey degrees, and give some evidence that this is tight. This is the first time finiteness of big Ramsey degrees has been established for a random structure in an infinite language. Our results represent an important step towards a better understanding of big Ramsey degrees for structures with relations of arity greater than two.</description>

      <title>$K_2$-Hamiltonian Graphs: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use theoretical and computational tools to continue our investigation of $K_2$-hamiltonian graphs, that is, graphs in which the removal of any pair of adjacent vertices yields a hamiltonian graph, and their interplay with $K_1$-hamiltonian graphs, that is, graphs in which every vertex-deleted subgraph is hamiltonian. Perhaps surprisingly, there exist graphs that are both $K_1$- and $K_2$-hamiltonian, yet non-hamiltonian, for example, the Petersen graph. Gr\"unbaum conjectured that every planar $K_1$-hamiltonian graph must itself be hamiltonian; Thomassen disproved this conjecture. Here we show that even planar graphs that are both $K_1$- and $K_2$-hamiltonian need not be hamiltonian, and that the number of such graphs grows at least exponentially. Motivated by results of Aldred, McKay, and Wormald, we determine for every integer $n$ that is not 14 or 17 whether there exists a $K_2$-hypohamiltonian, that is, non-hamiltonian and $K_2$-hamiltonian, graph of order $n$, and characterise all orders for which such cubic graphs and such snarks exist. We also describe the smallest cubic planar graph which is $K_2$-hypohamiltonian, as well as the smallest planar $K_2$-hypohamiltonian graph of girth $5$. We conclude with open problems and by correcting two inaccuracies from the first article.</description>

      <title>Permutation Entropy for Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shannon Entropy is the preeminent tool for measuring the level of uncertainty (and conversely, information content) in a random variable. In the field of communications, entropy can be used to express the information content of given signals (represented as time series) by considering random variables which sample from specified subsequences. In this paper, we will discuss how an entropy variant, the \textit{permutation entropy} can be used to study and classify radio frequency signals in a noisy environment. The permutation entropy is the entropy of the random variable which samples occurrences of permutation patterns from time series given a fixed window length, making it a function of the distribution of permutation patterns. Since the permutation entropy is a function of the relative order of data, it is (global) amplitude agnostic and thus allows for comparison between signals at different scales. This article is intended to describe a permutation patterns approach to a data driven problem in radio frequency communications research, and includes a primer on all non-permutation pattern specific background. An empirical analysis of the methods herein on radio frequency data is included. No prior knowledge of signals analysis is assumed, and permutation pattern specific notation will be included. This article serves as a self-contained introduction to the relationship between permutation patterns, entropy, and signals analysis for studying radio frequency signals and includes results on a classification task.</description>

      <title>Measuring well quasi-ordered finitary powersets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of a well-quasi-order (wqo) can be measured through three ordinal invariants: the width as a measure of antichains, height as a measure of chains, and maximal order type as a measure of bad sequences.
  We study these ordinal invariants for the finitary powerset, i.e., the collection Pf(A) of finite subsets of a wqo A ordered with the Hoare embedding relation. We show that the invariants of Pf(A) cannot be expressed as a function of the invariants of A, and provide tight upper and lower bounds for them.
  We then focus on a family of well-behaved wqos, for which these invariants can be computed compositionally, using a newly defined ordinal invariant called the approximate maximal order type. This family is built from multiplicatively indecomposable ordinals, using classical operations such as disjoint unions, products, finite words, finite multisets, and the finitary powerset construction.</description>
