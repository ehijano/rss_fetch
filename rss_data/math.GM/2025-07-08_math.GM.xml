      <title>Extending Hridaya Kolam to Even-Ordered Dot Patterns and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the mathematical framework of Hridaya Kolam patterns by applying modular arithmetic to even-ordered dot arrangements with arm counts co-prime to the number of dots. We analyze the resulting cyclic sequences that correspond to Eulerian circuits, enabling continuous single-stroke kolam designs beyond the classical odd-ordered cases. Our method provides explicit algorithms for constructing these intricate patterns, unveiling new symmetries and structural properties. Elevating this traditional floor art, we translate these mathematically grounded motifs into striking designs, showcasing their beauty and complexity in contemporary dari art in the carpet and textile sectors.</description>

      <title>Common Fixed Points of Cq-Commuting Maps via Generalized Gregus-Type Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of common fixed points for $C_q$-commuting self-mappings satisfying a generalized Gregus-type inequality with quadratic terms in $q$-starshaped subsets of normed linear spaces. Our framework extends classical fixed point theory through: 
  (i) Set-distance constraints $\delta(\cdot, [q, \cdot])$ generalizing norm conditions
 (ii) Compatibility via $C_q$-commutativity without full affinity requirements
  (iii) Reciprocal continuity replacing full map continuity. 
  Explicit examples (e.g., Example 2.6) demonstrate the non-triviality of these extensions. As applications, we derive invariant approximation theorems for best approximation sets. Our results generalize Nashine's work \cite{Nashine2007} and unify several known fixed point theorems.</description>

      <title>One-way multilinear functions of the second order with linear shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a novel class of binary operations on finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field K, defined by second-order multilinear expressions with linear shifts. These operations generate polynomials whose degree increases linearly with each iterated application, while the number of distinct monomials grows combinatorially. We demonstrate that, despite being non-associative and non-commutative in general, these operations exhibit power associativity and internal commutativity when iterated on a single vector. This ensures that exponentiation a^n is well-defined and unambiguous.
  Crucially, the absence of a closed-form expression for a^n suggests a one-way property: computing a^n from a and n is efficient, while recovering n from a^n (the Discrete Iteration Problem) appears computationally hard. We propose a Diffie-Hellman-like key exchange protocol based on this principle, introducing the Algebraic Diffie-Hellman Problem (ADHP) as an underlying assumption of security.
  In addition to the algebraic foundations, we empirically investigate the orbit structure of these operations over finite fields, observing frequent emergence of long cycles and highly regular behavior across parameter sets. Motivated by these dynamics, we further propose a pseudorandom number generation (PRNG) strategy based on multi-element multiplication patterns. This approach empirically achieves near-maximal cycle lengths and excellent statistical uniformity, highlighting the potential of these operations for cryptographic and combinatorial applications.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Fault Trees: the Fast and the Formal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous framework for handling uncertainty in quantitative fault tree analysis based on fuzzy theory. We show that any algorithm for fault tree unreliability analysis can be adapted to this framework in a fully general and computationally efficient manner. This result crucially leverages both the alpha-cut representation of fuzzy numbers and the coherence property of fault trees. We evaluate our algorithms on an established benchmark of synthetic fault trees, demonstrating their practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>On the Laplace transforms of derivatives of special functions with respect to parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to derivation of the Laplace transforms of the derivatives with respect to parameters of certain special functions, namely, the Mittag-Leffler type, Wright and Le Roy type functions. These formulas show interconnection of these functions and lead to better understanding of their behaviour on the real line. These formulas are represented in the convoluted form and reconstructed in a more suitable form by using Efros theorem</description>

      <title>A Complete Characterization Theorem for Fuzzy Differentiability on Time Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the generalized Hukuhara differentiability of fuzzy number-valued functions on arbitrary time scales using delta calculus. By carefully examining and improving existing results, we develop a unified and complete characterization theorem that covers a wide range of differentiability behaviors, including some cases that were previously missed. Our approach addresses important limitations and redundancies in earlier work, providing a clearer and more flexible understanding of fuzzy differentiability.</description>

      <title>Functional Reformulation of the Continuity Equation in Gases with Constant Density and its Application to the Existence Problem of Smooth Solutions to the Navier Stokes System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a rigorous reformulation of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations, starting from the energy equation and the ideal gas law. This reformulation allows the definition of a functional over the pressure field, which is used to bound the viscous dissipation term. It is shown that this norm can replace classical regularity criteria and serves as the foundation for a complete functional framework that includes local existence, singularity control, variational formulation, and uniqueness conditions.</description>

      <title>A Note on Deaconescu's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hasanalizade [1] studied Deaconescu's conjecture for positive composite integer $n$. A positive composite integer $n\geq4$ is said to be a Deaconescu number if $S_2(n)\mid \phi(n)-1$. In this paper, we improve Hasanalizade's result by proving that a Deaconescu number $n$ must have at least seventeen distinct prime divisors, i.e., $\omega(n)\geq 17$ and must be strictly larger than $5.86\cdot10^{22}$. Further, we prove that if any Deaconescu number $n$ has all prime divisors greater than or equal to $11$, then $\omega(n)\geq p^{*}$, where $p^{*}$ is the smallest prime divisor of $n$ and if $n\in D_3$ then all the prime divisors of $n$ must be congruent to $2$ modulo $3$ and $\omega(n)\geq 48$.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Heuristic Sieve for the Twin Prime Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative distribution of twin primes remains a central open problem in number theory. This paper develops a heuristic model grounded in the principles of sieve theory, with the goal of constructing an analytical approximation for the twin prime constant from first principles. The core of this method, which we term ``$f(t; z)$ function analysis'', involves representing the sieve's density product as a ratio of infinite series involving $f(t;z)$, the elementary symmetric polynomials of prime reciprocals. This framework provides a constructive path to approximate the celebrated Hardy-Littlewood constant for twin primes. We present a detailed and transparent numerical analysis, comparing the truncated series approximation to empirical data. The limitations of the model, particularly those related to series truncation and the choice of sieving parameters, are rigorously discussed. The primary value of this work lies not in proposing a superior predictive formula, but in offering a clear, decomposable, and analytically tractable heuristic for understanding the multiplicative structure of sieve constants.</description>

      <title>Associativity of two-place functions generated by left continuous monotone functions and other properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a weak pseudo-inverse of a monotone function, which is applied to characterize the associativity of a two-place function $T: [0,1]^2\rightarrow [0,1]$ defined by $T(x,y)=t^{[-1]}(F(t(x),t(y)))$ where $F:[0,\infty]^2\rightarrow[0,\infty]$ is an associative function with neutral element in $[0,\infty]$, $t: [0,1]\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ is a left continuous monotone function and $t^{[-1]}:[0,\infty]\rightarrow[0,1]$ is the weak pseudo-inverse of $t$. It shows that the associativity of the function $T$ depends only on properties of the range of $t$. Moreover, it investigates the idempotence, the limit property, the conditional cancellation law and the continuity of the function $T$, respectively.</description>
