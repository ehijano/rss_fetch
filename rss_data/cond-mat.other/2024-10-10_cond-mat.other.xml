      <title>Capture and release of quantum vortices using mechanical devices in low-temperature superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Gross-Pitaevskii equation coupled with the wave equation for a wire (GP-W) provides a natural theoretical framework for understanding recent experiments employing a nanowire to detect a single quantum vortex in superfluid $^4 {\rm He}$. We uncover the complete spatiotemporal evolution of such wire-based vortex detection via direct numerical simulations of the GP-W system. Furthermore, by computing the spatiotemporal spectrum, we obtain the vortex-capture-induced change in the oscillation frequency of the wire. We quantify this frequency shift by plotting the wire's oscillation frequency versus time and obtain results that closely match experimental observations. In addition, we provide analytical support for our numerical results by deriving the dispersion relation for the oscillating wire, with and without a trapped vortex.</description>

      <title>Scattering Theory of Chiral Edge Modes in Topological Magnon Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological magnon insulators exhibit robust edge modes with chiral properties similar to quantum Hall edge states. However, due to their strong localization at the edges, interactions between these chiral edge magnons can be significant, as we show in a model of coupled magnon-conserving spin chains in an electric field gradient. The chiral edge modes remain edge-localized and do not scatter into the bulk, and we characterize their scattering phase: for strongly-localized edge modes we observe significant deviation from the bare scattering phase. This renormalization of edge scattering can be attributed to bound bulk modes resonating with the chiral edge magnons, in the spirit of Feshbach resonances in atomic physics. We argue a real-time measurement protocol using spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy to study their scattering dynamics. Our result show that interaction among magnons can be encoded in an effective edge model of reduced dimensionality, where the interactions with the bulk renormalize the effective couplings. This work paves the way to develop a many-body effective theory for chiral edge magnons.</description>

      <title>Effective particles in a multishell nanostructure with hardcore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-medium effective carriers with position-dependent mass in a multishell heterostructure are analytically studied. We obtain the exact spectrum of three-dimensional bound eigenstates and the scattering wave-functions for several von Roos ordering classes. Ascribing a continuously varying mass to the carriers in a multilayer type spherical system we use our solutions to compute optical properties such as the absorption coefficients and refraction indices of a nanometric heterostructure. We analyze in detail the case of a GaAs/Al-GaAs alloy and show how these results depend on the ordering class of the kinetic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Coupled resonators based on high permittivity dielectrics for microwave sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of coupled cavities with high quality factor is of undoubted interest for several applications including those concerning quantum sensing and metrology. Here we report on a coupled cavity configuration in which a high $Q$-factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$) dielectric resonator. We carried out first tests using a SrTiO$_3$ (STO) resonator at 0.1 GHz, whose permittivity has been observed to reach values higher than 30000 a 0.16 K. The sensitivities of such configurations are discussed both in strong coupling and weak coupling regime. In particular we show that the notch of the coupled system has, as a function of the permittivity, a frequency sensitivity of 2.8 MHz for $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \approx 230$. These results highlight the potential of the coupled resonator systems as microwave sensors and are useful for the engineering of high permittivity resonators for applications at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Quantum kinetic theory of photons in degenerate plasmas: a field-theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, many practical results are often derived using classical or semiclassical approximations, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing novel couplings absent in classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both the kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity field, which are important in degenerate conditions.</description>

      <title>Evolution of vortex filaments and reconnections in the Gross-Pitaevski equation and its approximation by the binormal flow equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of a vortex line following the binormal flow equation (i.e. with a velocity proportional to the local curvature in the direction of the binormal vector) has been postulated as an approximation for the evolution of vortex filaments in both the Euler system for inviscid incompressible fluids and the Gross-Pitaevski equation in superfluids. We address the issue of whether this is a suitable approximation or not and its degree of validity by using rigorous mathematical methods and direct numerical simulations. More specifically, we show that, as the vortex core thickness goes to zero, the vortex core moves (at leading order and for long periods of time) with a velocity proportional to its local curvature and the binormal vector to the curve. The main idea of our analysis lies in a reformulation of the Gross-Pitaevski equation in terms of associated velocity and vorticity fields that resemble the Euler system written in terms of vorticity in its weak form. We also present full numerical simulations aimed to compare Gross-Pitaevski and binormal flow in various physical situations of interest such as the periodic evolution of deformed vortex rings and the reconnection of vortex filaments.</description>

      <title>Broken intrinsic symmetry induced magnon-magnon coupling in synthetic ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets offer rich magnon energy spectra in which optical and acoustic magnon branches can hybridize. Here, we demonstrate a broken intrinsic symmetry induced coupling of acoustic and optical magnons in a synthetic ferrimagnet consisting of two dissimilar antiferromagnetically interacting ferromagnetic metals. Two distinct magnon modes hybridize at degeneracy points, as indicated by an avoided level-crossing. The avoided level-crossing gap depends on the interlayer exchange interaction between the magnetic layers, which can be controlled by adjusting the non-magnetic interlayer thickness. An exceptionally large avoided level crossing gap of 6 GHz is revealed, exceeding the coupling strength that is typically found in other magnonic hybrid systems based on a coupling of magnons with photons or magnons and phonons.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of quantum caustics in the dynamics of interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have predicted the existence of caustics in many-body quantum dynamics, where they manifest as extended regions of enhanced probability density that obey temporal and spatial scaling relations. Focusing on the transverse-field Ising model, we investigate the dynamics initiated by a local quench in a spin chain, resulting in outward-propagating excitations that create a distinct caustic pattern. We calculate the scaling of the first two maxima of the interference fringes dressing the caustic, finding a universal exponent of 2/3, associated with an Airy function catastrophe. We demonstrate that this property is universal in the entire paramagnetic phase of the model, and starts varying at the quantum phase transition (QPT). This robust scaling persists even under perturbations that break the integrability of the model. We additionally explore the effect of boundary conditions and find that open boundaries introduce significant edge effects, leading to complex interference patterns. Despite these edge-induced dynamics, the overall power-law scaling exponent remains robust. These findings highlight the potential of quantum caustics as a powerful diagnostic tool for QPTs, demonstrating resilience against integrability-breaking perturbations and boundary condition variations.</description>

      <title>Abnormal Frequency Response Determined by Saddle Points in Non-Hermitian Crystal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian crystal systems under open boundary condition (OBC), it is generally believed that the OBC modes with frequencies containing positive imaginary parts, when excited by external driving, will experience exponential growth in population, thereby leading to instability. However, our work challenges this conventional understanding. In such a system, we find an anomalous response that grows exponentially with the frequency aligned with those of saddle points. The frequencies of these saddle points on the complex plane are below the maximum imaginary part of OBC spectrum, but they can lie within or beyond the OBC spectrum. We derive general formulas of excitation-response relationships and find that this anomalous response can occur because the excitation of OBC modes eventually evolve toward these saddle points at long times. Only when the frequencies of all these saddle points are below the real axis do the non-Hermitian crystal systems remain stable under periodic excitation. Thus our results also provide new insights on the stability criterion of non-Hermitian crystal systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusive dynamics of fractionalized particles and the enhanced conductivity at the border of the neutral-ionic transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diffusive dynamics of the classical one-dimensional lattice model of mobile particles featuring the incoherent metallic state of the organic TTF-CA found in the vicinity of the neutral-ionic(NI)-transition. The particles are strongly correlated and feel the alternating site potentials, exhibiting uniform ionic (I) Mott insulating and neutral band insulating (N) phases when the Coulomb interaction and site potentials are large, respectively. We focus on the neutral-ionic domain walls (NIDW) activated by their competition, which is typically regarded as fractionalized particles. The finite temperature phase diagram reveals a thermodynamically stable NIDW phase not found in previous literature that emerges at the triple point, where the transition line splits into two first-order lines toward the critical endpoints. We analyze the long-time behavior of dynamics of the NIDWs and find that it captures the diffusive transport of the system. The conductivity derived from the diffusion constant and the number population of NIDWs shows a strong enhancement inside the NIDW phase, which can explain the large conductivity at the NI crossover found in TTF-CA.</description>
