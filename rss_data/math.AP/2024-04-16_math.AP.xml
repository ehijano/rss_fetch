      <title>Some approximation results in time and space dependent Musielak spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide density results for smooth functions in non-reflexive Musielak spaces defined up on time- and space- dependent modular functions. These Musielak spaces encompass a broad class of functional framework such as Bochner spaces, inhomogeneous Orlicz spaces as well as variable-exponent Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Hypersonic limit for steady compressible Euler flows passing straight cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hypersonic limit for steady, uniform, and compressible polytropic gas passing a symmetric straight cone. By considering Radon measure solutions, we show that as the Mach number of the upstream flow tends to infinity, the measures associated with the weak entropy solution containing an attached shock ahead of the cone converge vaguely to the measures associated with a Radon measure solution to the conical hypersonic-limit flow. This justifies the Newtonian sine-squared pressure law for cones in hypersonic aerodynamics. For Chaplygin gas, assuming that the Mach number of the incoming flow is less than a finite critical value, we demonstrate that the vertex angle of the leading shock is independent of the conical body's vertex angle and is totally determined by the incoming flow's Mach number. If the Mach number exceeds the critical value, we explicitly construct a Radon measure solution with a concentration boundary layer.</description>

      <title>Non-local traffic flow models with time delay: well-posedness and numerical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the well-posedness of weak entropy solutions of a scalar non-local traffic flow model with time delay. Existence is obtained by convergence of finite volume approximate solutions constructed by Lax-Friedrich and Hilliges-Weidlich schemes, while the L1 stability with respect to the initial data and the delay parameter relies on a Kruzkov-type doubling of variable technique.Numerical tests are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes, as well as the solution dependence on the delay and look-ahead parameters.</description>

      <title>Determining the order of time and spatial fractional derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the initial-boundary value problem for equation $D^\rho_t u(x,t)+ (-\Delta)^\sigma u(x,t)=0$, $\rho\in (0,1)$, $\sigma&gt;0$, in an N-dimensional domain $\Omega$ with a homogeneous Dirichlet condition. The fractional derivative is taken in the sense of Caputo. The main goal of the work is to solve the inverse problem of simultaneously determining two parameters: the order of the fractional derivative $\rho$ and the degree of the Laplace operator $\sigma$. A new formulation and solution method for this inverse problem are proposed. It is proved that in the new formulation the solution to the inverse problem exists and is unique for an arbitrary initial function from the class $L_2(\Omega)$. Note that in previously known works, only the uniqueness of the solution to the inverse problem was proved and the initial function was required to be sufficiently smooth and non-negative.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Navier-Stokes phase-field crystal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an evolution system modeling a flow of colloidal particles which are suspended in an incompressible fluid and accounts for colloidal crystallization. The system consists of the Navier-Stokes equations for the volume averaged velocity coupled with the so-called Phase-Field Crystal equation for the density deviation. Considering this system in a periodic domain and assuming that the viscosity as well as the mobility depend on the density deviation, we first prove the existence of a weak solution in dimension three. Then, in dimension two, we establish the existence of a (unique) strong solution.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of blow-up profiles for a quasilinear diffusion equation with source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify radially symmetric self-similar profiles presenting finite time blow-up to the quasilinear diffusion equation with weighted source $$ u_t=\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, $$ posed for $(x,t)\in\real^N\times(0,T)$, $T&gt;0$, in dimension $N\geq1$ and in the range of exponents $-2&lt;\sigma&lt;\infty$, $1&lt;m&lt;p&lt;p_s(\sigma)$, where $$ p_s(\sigma)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{m(N+2\sigma+2)}{N-2}, &amp; N\geq3,\\ +\infty, &amp; N\in\{1,2\},\end{array}\right. $$ is the renowned Sobolev critical exponent. The most interesting result is the \emph{multiplicity of two different types} of self-similar profiles for $p$ sufficiently close to $m$ and $\sigma$ sufficiently close to zero in dimension $N\geq2$, including \emph{dead-core profiles}. For $\sigma=0$, this answers in dimension $N\geq2$ a question still left open in \cite[Section IV.1.4, pp. 195-196]{S4}, where only multiplicity in dimension $N=1$ had been established. Besides this result, we also prove that, for any $\sigma\in(-2,0)$, $N\geq1$ and $m&lt;p&lt;p_s(\sigma)$ \emph{existence} of at least a self-similar blow-up profile is granted. In strong contrast with the previous results, given any $N\geq1$, $\sigma\geq\sigma^*=(mN+2)/(m-1)$ and $p\in(m,p_s(\sigma))$, \emph{non-existence} of any radially symmetric self-similar profile is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the vanishing dissipation limit of the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, where the initial data approach a profile generating a planar rarefaction wave for the limit Euler system. We show that the associated weak solutions converge unconditionally to the planar rarefaction wave strongly in the energy norm.</description>

      <title>Gradient contractivity of a rescaled resolvent on domains in Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an abstract Wiener space $(X,\gamma,H)$, we consider an open set $O\subseteq X$ which satisfies certain smoothness and mean-curvature conditions. We prove that the rescaled resolvent operator associated to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on $O$ is gradient contractive in $L^p(X,\gamma)$ for every $p\in(1,\infty)$. This is the Gaussian counterpart of an analogous result for the rescaled resolvent operator associated to the Laplace operator $\Delta$ in $L^p$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure, $p\in[1,\infty)$, with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on a bounded convex open set $O\subseteq \mathbb R^n$.</description>

      <title>Space Regularity of Evolution Equations Driven by Rough Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the linear evolution equation $dy(t)=Ay(t)dt+Gy(t)dx(t)$, where $A$ is a closed operator, associated to a semigroup, with good smoothing effects in a Banach space $E$, $x$ is a nonsmooth path, which is $\eta$-H\"older continuous for some $\eta\in (1/3,1/2]$, and $G$ is a non-smoothing linear operator on $E$. We prove that the Cauchy problem associated with the previous equation admits a unique mild solution and we also show that the solution increases the regularity of the initial datum as soon as time evolves. Then, we show that the mild solution is also an integral solution and this allows us to prove a It\^o formula.</description>

      <title>Partial Differential Equations on Low-Dimensional Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis pertains to the study of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations on "thin" structures. The first main objective is to establish the strong and weak low-dimensional counterparts of the parabolic Neumann problem. The main technical result is proving the closedness of the low-dimensional second-order operator. To construct a semigroup, a variant of Magyar of the Hille-Yosida Theorem for non-invertible operators is adapted. An alternative direction of study is presented to extend the class of accessible initial data. Weak-type parabolic problems are defined, and the existence of solutions is obtained by the application of the Lions version of the Lax-Milgram Lemma. The second aspect of the thesis is to examine the higher regularity of weak solutions to low-dimensional elliptic problems. We prove that for any weak low-dimensional elliptic solution, some Cosserat vector field exists as a witness of the membership of the solution to the domain of the second-order operator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study various aspects of the mixed ray transform of $(k + \ell)$-tensor fields that are symmetric in its first $k$ and last $\ell$ indices. As a first result, we derive an inversion algorithm to recover the solenoidal part of the unknown tensor field using the normal operator of the mixed ray transform. Next, we establish a set of unique continuation results. In addition to these, we discuss the range characterization of the mixed ray transform as the final result.</description>

      <title>Onsager's "Ideal Turbulence" Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lars Onsager in 1945-1949 made an exact analysis of the high Reynolds-number limit for individual turbulent flow realizations modeled by incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, motivated by experimental observations that dissipation of kinetic energy does not vanish. I review here developments spurred by his key idea, that such flows are well-described by distributional or "weak" solutions of ideal Euler equations. 1/3 H\"older singularities of the velocity field were predicted by Onsager and since observed. His theory describes turbulent energy cascade without probabilistic assumptions and yields a local, deterministic version of the Kolmogorov 4/5th law. The approach is closely related to renormalization group methods in physics and envisages "conservation-law anomalies", as discovered later in quantum field theory. There are also deep connections with Large-Eddy Simulation modeling. More recently, dissipative Euler solutions of the type conjectured by Onsager have been constructed and his 1/3 H\"older singularity proved to be the sharp threshold for anomalous dissipation. This progress has been achieved by an unexpected connection with work of John Nash on isometric embeddings of low regularity or "convex integration" techniques. The dissipative Euler solutions yielded by this method are wildly non-unique for fixed initial data, suggesting "spontaneously stochastic" behavior of high-Reynolds number solutions. I focus in particular on applications to wall-bounded turbulence, leading to novel concepts of spatial cascades of momentum, energy and vorticity to or from the wall as deterministic, space-time local phenomena. This theory thus makes testable predictions and offers new perspectives on Large-Eddy Simulation in presence of solid walls.</description>

      <title>Optimal stability results and nonlinear duality for $L^\infty$ entropy and $L^1$ viscosity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.02058v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new and rigorous duality relation between two central notions of weak solutions of nonlinear PDEs: entropy and viscosity solutions. It takes the form of the nonlinear dual inequality: \begin{equation}\int |S_t u_0-S_t v_0| \varphi_0 \mathrm{d}x\leq \int |u_0-v_0| G_t \varphi_0 \mathrm{d}x, \quad \forall \varphi_0 \geq 0, \forall u_0, \forall v_0, \qquad(\star)\end{equation} where $S_t$ is the entropy solution semigroup of the anisotropic degenerate parabolic equation \begin{equation*} \partial_t u+\mathrm{div} F(u) = \mathrm{div} (A(u) D u),\end{equation*} and where we look for the smallest semigroup $G_t$ satisfying ($\star$). This amounts to finding an optimal weighted $L^1$ contraction estimate for $S_t$. Our main result is that $G_t$ is the viscosity solution semigroup of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation\begin{equation*} \partial_t \varphi = \mathrm{sup}_\xi \{F'(\xi) \cdot D \varphi+\mathrm{tr}(A(\xi) D^2\varphi)\}.\end{equation*} Since weighted $L^1$ contraction results are mainly used for possibly nonintegrable $L^\infty$ solutions $u$, the natural spaces behind this duality are $L^\infty$ for $S_t$ and $L^1$ for $G_t$. We therefore develop a corresponding $L^1$ theory for viscosity solutions $\varphi$. But $L^1$ itself is too large for well-posedness, and we rigorously identify the weakest $L^1$ type Banach setting where we can have it -- a subspace of $L^1$ called $L^\infty_{\mathrm{int}}$. A consequence of our results is a new domain of dependence like estimate for second order anisotropic degenerate parabolic PDEs. It is given in terms of a stochastic target problem and extends in a natural way recent results for first order hyperbolic PDEs by [N. Pogodaev, J. Differ. Equ., 2018].</description>

      <title>A numerical study of vortex nucleation in 2D rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a new numerical method for the minimization under constraints of a discrete energy modeling multicomponents rotating Bose-Einstein condensates in the regime of strong confinement and with rotation. Moreover, we consider both segregation and coexistence regimes between the components. The method includes a discretization of a continuous energy in space dimension 2 and a gradient algorithm with adaptive time step and projection for the minimization. It is well known that, depending on the regime, the minimizers may display different structures, sometimes with vorticity (from singly quantized vortices, to vortex sheets and giant holes). In order to study numerically the structures of the minimizers, we introduce in this paper a numerical algorithm for the computation of the indices of the vortices, as well as an algorithm for the computation of the indices of vortex sheets. Several computations are carried out, to illustrate the efficiency of the method, to cover different physical cases, to validate recent theoretical results as well as to support conjectures. Moreover, we compare this method with an alternative method from the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whereas many different models exist in the mathematical and physics literature for ground states of non-relativistic crystals, the relativistic case has been much less studied and we are not aware of any mathematical result on a fully relativistic treatment of crystals. In this paper, we introduce a mean-field relativistic energy for crystals in terms of periodic density matrices. This model is inspired both from a recent definition of the Dirac-Fock ground state for atoms and molecules, due to one of us, and from the non-relativistic Hartree-Fock model for crystals. We prove the existence of a ground state when the number of electrons per cell is not too large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a result on propagation of the anisotropic Gabor wave front set for linear operators with a tempered distribution Schwartz kernel. The anisotropic Gabor wave front set is parametrized by a positive parameter relating the space and frequency variables. The anisotropic Gabor wave front set of the Schwartz kernel is assumed to satisfy a graph type criterion. The result is applied to a class of evolution equations that generalizes the Schr\"odinger equation for the free particle. The Laplacian is replaced by any partial differential operator with constant coefficients, real symbol and order at least two.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of quintic nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations in $H^{2/5+}(\mathbb{T})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we succeed in integrating Strichartz estimates (encoding the dispersive effects of the equations) in Birkhoff normal form techniques. As a consequence, we deduce a result on the long time behavior of quintic NLS solutions on the circle for small but very irregular initial data (in $H^s$ for $s &gt; 2/5$). Note that since $2/5 &lt; 1$, we cannot claim conservation of energy and, more importantly, since $2/5 &lt; 1/2$, we must dispense with the algebra property of $H^s$. This is the first dynamical result where we use the dispersive properties of NLS in a context of Birkhoff normal form.</description>

      <title>Some nonlocal formulas inspired by an identity of James Simon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a classical identity proved by James Simons, we establish a new geometric formula in a nonlocal, possibly fractional, setting.
  Our formula also recovers the classical case in the limit, thus providing an approach to Simons' work that does not heavily rely on differential geometry.</description>

      <title>An $L_{q}(L_{p})$-regularity theory for parabolic equations with integro-differential operators having low intensity kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to parabolic equations with non-local operators $$ \partial_{t}u(t,x) = \mathcal{L}^{a}u(t,x) + f(t,x), \quad t&gt;0 $$ in $L_{q}(L_{p})$ spaces. Our spatial operator $\mathcal{L}^{a}$ is an integro-differential operator of the form $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} \left( u(x+y)-u(x) -\nabla u(x) \cdot y \mathrm{1}_{|y|\leq 1} \right) a(t,y) j_{d}(|y|)dy. $$ Here, $a(t,y)$ is a merely bounded measurable coefficient, and we employed the theory of additive process to handle it. We investigate conditions on $j_{d}(r)$ which yield $L_{q}(L_{p})$-regularity of solutions. Our assumptions on $j_d$ are general so that $j_d(r)$ may be comparable to $r^{-d}\ell(r^{-1})$ for a function $\ell$ which is slowly varying at infinity. For example, we can take $\ell(r)=\log{(1+r^{\alpha})}$ or $\ell(r) = \min{\{r^{\alpha},1\}}$ ($\alpha\in(0,2)$). Indeed, our result covers the operators whose Fourier multiplier $\psi(\xi)$ does not have any scaling condition for $|\xi|\geq 1$. Furthermore, we give some examples of operators, which cannot be covered by previous results where smoothness or scaling conditions on $\psi$ are considered.</description>

      <title>Determining time-dependent convection and density terms in convection-diffusion equation using partial data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study an inverse boundary value problem for the time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. We use the nonlinear Carleman weight to recover the time-dependent convection term and time-dependent density coefficient uniquely. Nonlinear weight allows us to prove the uniqueness of the coefficients by making measurements on a possibly very small subset of the boundary. We proved that the convection term and the density coefficient can be recovered up to the natural gauge from the knowledge of the Dirichlet to Neumann map measured on a very small open subset of the boundary.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence of strong solutions to the initial value problem for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^N, N\geq 3$. Our investigation shows that local in-time classical solutions do not develop singularity as long as the initial velocity lies in $(L^2(\mathbb{R}^N))^N\cap (L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N))^N$.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equations in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Cauchy problem for the dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equation where $0&lt;\alpha \leq 1$ \begin{eqnarray*} \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \partial_t u+|\partial_x|^{1+\alpha}\partial_x u+uu_x=0,\\ u(x,0)=u_0(x), \end{array} \right. \end{eqnarray*} is locally well-posed in the Fourier-Lebesgue space $\widehat{H}^{s}_{r}(\mathbb{R})$. This is proved via Picard iteration arguments using $X^{s,b}$-type space adapted to the Fourier-Lebesgue space, inspired by the work of Gr\"unrock and Vega. Note that, previously, Molinet, Saut and Tzvetkov \cite{MST2001} proved that the solution map is not $C^2$ in $H^s$ for any $s$ if $0\leq \alpha&lt;1$. However, in the Fourier-Lebesgue space, we have a stronger smoothing effect to handle the $high\times low$ interactions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving finite difference method for partially dissipative hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the preservation of asymptotic properties of partially dissipative hyperbolic systems when switching to a discrete setting. We prove that one of the simplest consistent and unconditionally stable numerical methods - the central finite difference scheme - preserves both the asymptotic behaviour and the parabolic relaxation limit of one-dimensional partially dissipative hyperbolic systems which satisfy the Kalman rank condition.
  The large time asymptotic-preserving property is achieved by conceiving time-weighted perturbed energy functionals in the spirit of the hypocoercivity theory. For the relaxation-preserving property, drawing inspiration from the observation that solutions in the continuous case exhibit distinct behaviours in low and high frequencies, we introduce a novel discrete Littlewood-Paley theory tailored to the central finite difference scheme. This allows us to prove Bernstein-type estimates for discrete differential operators and leads to a new relaxation result: the strong convergence of the discrete linearized compressible Euler system with damping towards the discrete heat equation, uniformly with respect to the mesh parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyse functions in Besov spaces $B^{1/q}_{q,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d),q\in (1,\infty)$, and functions in fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{r,q}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d),r\in (0,1),q\in [1,\infty)$. We prove for Besov functions $u\in B^{1/q}_{q,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d)$ the summability of the difference between one-sided approximate limits in power $q$, $|u^+-u^-|^q$, along the jump set $\mathcal{J}_u$ of $u$ with respect to Hausdorff measure $\mathcal{H}^{N-1}$, and establish the best bound from above on the integral $\int_{\mathcal{J}_u}|u^+-u^-|^qd\mathcal{H}^{N-1}$ in terms of Besov constants. We show for functions $u\in B^{1/q}_{q,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d),q\in (1,\infty)$ that \begin{equation} \liminf\limits_{\varepsilon \to 0^+}\fint_{B_{\varepsilon}(x)} |u(z)-u_{B_{\varepsilon}(x)}|^qdz=0 \end{equation} for every $x$ outside of a $\mathcal{H}^{N-1}$-sigma finite set. For fractional Sobolev functions $u\in W^{r,q}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}^d)$ we prove that \begin{equation} \lim_{\rho\to 0^+}\fint_{B_{\rho}(x)}\fint_{B_{\rho}(x)} |u\big(z\big)-u(y)|^qdzdy=0 \end{equation} for $\mathcal{H}^{N-rq}$ a.e. $x$, where $q\in[1,\infty)$, $r\in(0,1)$ and $rq\leq N$. We prove for $u\in W^{1,q}(\mathbb{R}^N),1&lt;q\leq N$, that \begin{equation} \lim\limits_{\varepsilon\to 0^+}\fint_{B_{\varepsilon}(x)} |u(z)-u_{B_{\varepsilon}(x)}|^qdz=0 \end{equation} for $\mathcal{H}^{N-q}$ a.e. $x\in \mathbb{R}^N$.</description>

      <title>Weak well-posedness by transport noise for a class of 2D fluid dynamics equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental open problem in fluid dynamics is whether solutions to $2$D Euler equations with $(L^1_x\cap L^p_x)$-valued vorticity are unique, for some $p\in [1,\infty)$. A related question, more probabilistic in flavour, is whether one can find a physically relevant noise regularizing the PDE. We present some substantial advances towards a resolution of the latter, by establishing well-posedness in law for solutions with $(L^1_x\cap L^2_x)$-valued vorticity and finite kinetic energy, for a general class of stochastic 2D fluid dynamical equations; the noise is spatially rough and of Kraichnan type and we allow the presence of a deterministic forcing $f$. This class includes as primary examples logarithmically regularized 2D Euler and hypodissipative 2D Navier-Stokes equations. In the first case, our result solves the open problem posed by Flandoli. In the latter case, for well-chosen forcing $f$, the corresponding deterministic PDE without noise has recently been shown by Albritton and Colombo to be ill-posed; consequently, the addition of noise truly improves the solution theory for such PDE.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is guided by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is termed chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, experimental data was collected to infer this kernel. In this article, a PDE-constrained optimization framework is deployed to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>
