      <title>Identifying Protein Co-regulatory Network Logic by Solving B-SAT Problems through Gate-based Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09365v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing awareness that the success of pharmacologic interventions on living organisms is significantly impacted by context and timing of exposure. In turn, this complexity has led to an increased focus on regulatory network dynamics in biology and our ability to represent them in a high-fidelity way, in silico. Logic network models show great promise here and their parameter estimation can be formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that is well-suited to the often sparse, incomplete data in biology. Unfortunately, even in the case of Boolean logic, the combinatorial complexity of these problems grows rapidly, challenging the creation of models at physiologically-relevant scales. That said, quantum computing, while still nascent, facilitates novel information-processing paradigms with the potential for transformative impact in problems such as this one. In this work, we take a first step at actualizing this potential by identifying the structure and Boolean decisional logic of a well-studied network linking 5 proteins involved in the neural development of the mammalian cortical area of the brain. We identify the protein-protein connectivity and binary decisional logic governing this network by formulating it as a Boolean Satisfiability (B-SAT) problem. We employ Grover's algorithm to solve the NP-hard problem faster than the exponential time complexity required by deterministic classical algorithms. Using approaches deployed on both quantum simulators and actual noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, we accurately recover several high-likelihood models from very sparse protein expression data. The results highlight the differential roles of data types in supporting accurate models; the impact of quantum algorithm design as it pertains to the mutability of quantum hardware; and the opportunities for accelerated discovery enabled by this approach.</description>

      <title>CUTHERMO: Understanding GPU Memory Inefficiencies with Heat Map Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPUs have become indispensable in high-performance computing, machine learning, and many other domains. Efficiently utilizing the memory subsystem on GPUs is critical for maximizing computing power through massive parallelism. Analyzing memory access patterns has proven to be an effective method for understanding memory bottlenecks in applications. However, comprehensive runtime and fine-grained memory profiling support is lacking on GPU architectures. In this work, we introduce cuThermo, a lightweight and practical profiling tool for GPU memory analysis. It operates on GPU binaries without requiring any modifications to hardware, operating system, or application source code. Given a CUDA application, cuThermo identifies memory inefficiencies at runtime via a heat map based on distinct visited warp counts to represent word-sector-level data sharing and provides optimization guidance in performance tuning iterations. Through our experiments on six applications, we identified five memory access patterns that are portable across different GPU architectures. By evaluating optimization on two GPUs, cuThermo achieves up to $721.79\%$ performance improvement.</description>

      <title>Third-Party Assessment of Mobile Performance in the 5G Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The web experience using mobile devices is important since a significant portion of the Internet traffic is initiated from mobile devices. In the era of 5G, users expect a high-performance data network to stream media content and for other latency-sensitive applications. In this paper, we characterize mobile experience in terms of latency, throughput, and stability measured from a commercial, globally-distributed CDN. Unlike prior work, CDN data provides a relatively neutral, carrier-agnostic perspective, providing a clear view of multiple and international providers. Our analysis of mobile client traffic shows mobile users sometimes experience markedly low latency, even as low as 6 ms. However, only the top 5% users regularly experience less than 20 ms of minimum latency. While 100 Mb/s throughput is not rare, we show around 60% users observe less than 50 Mb/s throughput. We find the minimum mobile latency is generally stable at a specific location which can be an important characteristic for anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Grafting: A Mechanism for Optimizing AI Model Deployment in Resource-Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger, more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios. Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs. donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however, it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.</description>
