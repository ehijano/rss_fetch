      <title>On injective endomorphisms of the monoid $\boldsymbol{B}_{\omega}^{\mathscr{F}^3}$ with a three-element family $\mathscr{F}^3$ of inductive non-empty subsets of $\omega$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe injective endomorphisms of the semigroup $\boldsymbol{B}_{\omega}^{\mathscr{F}^3}$ with a three-element family $\mathscr{F}^3$ of inductive non-empty subsets of $\omega$. In particular we find endomorphisms $\varpi_3$ and $\lambda$ of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\omega}^{\mathscr{F}^3}$ such that for every injective endomorphism $\varepsilon$ of the semigroup $\boldsymbol{B}_{\omega}^{\mathscr{F}^3}$ there exists an injective endomorphism $\iota\in\left\langle\lambda,\varpi_3\right\rangle$ such that $\varepsilon=\alpha_{[k]}\circ\iota$ for some positive integer $k$, where $\alpha_{[k]}$ is an injective monoid endomorphism of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\omega}^{\mathscr{F}^3}$.</description>

      <title>Strongly and Uniformly Strongly co-Hopfian Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the so-called {\it strongly co-Hopfian} and {\it uniformly strongly co-Hopfian} Abelian groups, significantly generalizing some important results due to Abdelalim in the J. Math. Analysis (2015). Specifically, we prove that any strongly co-Hopfian group is a direct sum of an sp-group and a divisible group, both of which are strongly co-Hopfian. We also show that a group whose maximal torsion subgroup and corresponding torsion-free factor are both strongly co-Hopfian will also be strongly co-Hopfian. We provide several examples demonstrating that the converse of this statement does {\it not} generally hold, thus illustrating that the structure of genuinely mixed strongly co-Hopfian groups is rather complicated and does {\it not} entirely depend on the structure of its maximal torsion subgroup. We also establish that a strongly co-Hopfian group is cotorsion exactly when it is algebraically compact and, particularly, a reduced (adjusted) cotorsion group is strongly co-Hopfian only when its maximal torsion subgroup is strongly co-Hopfian. Additionally, we demonstrate that a strongly co-Hopfian group is uniformly strongly co-Hopfian exactly when its maximal torsion subgroup is strongly co-Hopfian.</description>

      <title>Comparison of addition and multiplication in a skew brace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A. Smoktunowicz and L. Vendramin conjectured that if $A=(A,\oplus,\odot)$ is a finite skew brace with solvable additive group $A_{\oplus}$, then the multiplicative group $A_{\odot}$ of $A$ is also solvable. Proving or disproving this conjecture is currently an open problem.
  The interest to the conjecture of A. Smoktunowicz and L. Vendramin is due to the fact that, despite the fact that the addition and multiplication in a skew brace are related to each other, they can be very different. The present work focuses on comparing addition and multiplication in a skew brace. The results presented in the paper say that if $B$ is a characteristic subgroup of $A_{\oplus}$, then under certain conditions on elements $a,b\in A$ the images of $a\odot b$ and $a\oplus b$ coincide in $A_{\oplus}/B$.
  As a corollary we conclude that if $A$ is a finite skew brace such that the derived subgroup $A_{\oplus}^{\prime}$ is cyclic, then $A_{\odot}$ is solvable. This statement gives a positive answer to the conjecture of A. Smoktunowicz and L. Vendramin in the case when $A_{\oplus}^{\prime}$ is a cyclic group.</description>

      <title>Generalized J-groups, J-braid groups and Seifert link groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of J-groups was introduced by Achar and Aubert with the goal of providing Coxeter-like combinatorial tools for studying rank 2 complex reflection groups. However, J-groups lack an explicit presentation with abstract reflections as generators. This gap was filled by Gobet, and later by the second author, for the subfamily of so-called J-reflection groups. The obtained presentations then gave rise to a concept of J-braid group, which coincides with the link groups of torus necklaces.
  In this paper we study a generalization of J-groups. We determine which of these groups are finitely generated. We show that, as for classical J-groups, the family of finite generalized J-groups coincides with the family of rank 2 complex reflection groups. We also show that finitely generated generalized J-groups coincide with what we call the torsion quotients of J-braid groups. We deduce explicit presentations for all finitely generated generalized J-groups, where the generators are abstract reflections. We also complete the classification of these groups up to reflection isomorphism.
  As a byproduct of these results, we obtain that a quotient of a Seifert link group obtained by adding torsion to meridians somehow determines the link up to isotopy. Moreover, such a quotient is finite if and only if it is isomorphic to a complex reflection group of rank two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous papers, Drungilas et al. study the problem of which triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ can be realized as $([E: \mathbb{Q}], [F: \mathbb{Q}], [EF: \mathbb{Q}])$, where $E$ and $F$ are number fields, using techniques from field theory. We shall study this problem rephrased in the language of groups using the Galois correspondence to simplify and generalize their results.</description>

      <title>The spherical growth series of amalgamated free products of infinite cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be an integer greater than $1$. We consider a group presented as $G(p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n)=\langle x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n \mid x_1^{p_1} =x_2^{p_2}=\cdots =x_n^{p_n} \rangle$, with integers $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$ satisfying $2 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_n$. This group is an amalgamated free product of infinite cyclic groups and is geometrically realized as the fundamental group of a Seifert fiber space over the 2-dimensional disk with $n$ cone points whose associated cone angles are $\frac{2\pi}{p_1},\frac{2\pi}{p_2},\dots,\frac{2\pi}{p_n}$. In this paper, we present a formula for the spherical growth series of the group $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ with respect to the generating set $\{x_1,\dots,x_n,x_1^{-1},\dots,x_n^{-1}\}$. We show that from this formula, a rational function expression for the spherical growth series of $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ can be derived in concrete form for given $p_1,\dots,p_n$. In fact, we wrote an elementary computer program based on this formula that yields an explicit form of a single rational fraction expression for the spherical growth series of $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$. We present such expressions for several tuples $(p_1,\dots,p_n)$. In 1999, C. P. Gill obtained a similar formula for the same group in the case $n=2$ and showed that there exists a rational function expression for the spherical growth series of $G(p_1,\dots,p_n)$ for $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that one variable equations in the lamplighter group $\MZ_2\wr \MZ$ are decidable and describe an algorithm for solving such equations. The algorithm has super-exponential time complexity in the worst case. We also show that, for most equations, decidability can be determined in nearly quadratic time; that is, the problem admits a nearly quadratic-time solution in the generic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every Hecke C*-algebra of right-angled, hyperbolic type, we construct a smooth subalgebra to which traces associated with arbitrary conjugacy classes in the associated Coxeter group extend. We calculate the pairing with K-theory of the delocalised traces arising this way, showing that it is faithful on K-theory.</description>

      <title>Posets of decompositions in spherical buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose definitions of the common bases complex, the poset of decompositions, and the poset of partial decompositions for arbitrary spherical buildings. We show that the poset of decompositions is Cohen-Macaulay, and that the poset of partial decompositions is spherical and homotopy equivalent to the common bases complex. To prove these results, we rely on the concepts of opposition, Levi spheres, and convexity in buildings.
  In particular, our results extend the already known constructions for the linear case (vector spaces) to arbitrary buildings. As a byproduct, we see that the poset of ordered partial decompositions carries the square of the Steinberg representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new infinite-dimensional family of homogeneous quasimorphisms on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of the two-sphere. Moreover, for any constant $K$ less than the total area of the sphere, we produce unbounded homogeneous quasimorphisms that vanish on any map supported on some disk of area at most $K$. As an application, we prove an analogue of the equator conjecture, namely that the space of equators equipped with any choice of quantitative fragmentation metric has infinite diameter. To prove our results, we introduce tools that draw inspiration from the theory of curve graphs used to study mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Vanishing uniqueness thresholds in Voronoi percolation on products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Poisson--Voronoi percolation and its discrete analogue Bernoulli--Voronoi percolation in spaces with a non-amenable product structure. We develop a new method of proving smallness of the uniqueness threshold $p_u(\lambda)$ at small intensities $\lambda&gt;0$ based on the unbounded borders phenomenon of their underlining ideal Poisson--Voronoi tessellation. We apply our method to several concrete examples in both the discrete and the continuum setting, including $k$-fold graph products of $d$-regular trees for $k\ge2,d\ge3$ and products of hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb H_{d_1}\times \ldots \times \mathbb H_{d_k}$ for $k\ge2, d_i\ge2$, complementing a recent result of the second and fourth author for symmetric spaces of connected higher rank semisimple real Lie groups with property (T). We also provide new examples of non-amenable Cayley graphs with the FIID sparse unique infinite cluster property, answering positively a recent question of Pete and Rokob.</description>

      <title>On the order of lazy cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the most elementary family of cellular automata defined over an arbitrary group universe $G$ and an alphabet $A$: the lazy cellular automata, which act as the identity on configurations in $A^G$, except when they read a unique active transition $p \in A^S$, in which case they write a fixed symbol $a \in A$. As expected, the dynamical behavior of lazy cellular automata is relatively simple, yet subtle questions arise since they completely depend on the choice of $p$ and $a$. In this paper, we investigate the order of a lazy cellular automaton $\tau : A^G \to A^G$, defined as the cardinality of the set $\{ \tau^k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$. In particular, we establish a general upper bound for the order of $\tau$ in terms of $p$ and $a$, and we prove that this bound is attained when $p$ is a quasi-constant pattern.</description>
