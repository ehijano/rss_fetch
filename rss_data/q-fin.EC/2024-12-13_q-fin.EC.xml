      <title>Emulating the Global Change Analysis Model with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) simulates complex interactions between the coupled Earth and human systems, providing valuable insights into the co-evolution of land, water, and energy sectors under different future scenarios. Understanding the sensitivities and drivers of this multisectoral system can lead to more robust understanding of the different pathways to particular outcomes. The interactions and complexity of the coupled human-Earth systems make GCAM simulations costly to run at scale - a requirement for large ensemble experiments which explore uncertainty in model parameters and outputs. A differentiable emulator with similar predictive power, but greater efficiency, could provide novel scenario discovery and analysis of GCAM and its outputs, requiring fewer runs of GCAM. As a first use case, we train a neural network on an existing large ensemble that explores a range of GCAM inputs related to different relative contributions of energy production sources, with a focus on wind and solar. We complement this existing ensemble with interpolated input values and a wider selection of outputs, predicting 22,528 GCAM outputs across time, sectors, and regions. We report a median $R^2$ score of 0.998 for the emulator's predictions and an $R^2$ score of 0.812 for its input-output sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Delving into Youth Perspectives on In-game Gambling-like Elements: A Proof-of-Concept Study Utilising Large Language Models for Analysing User-Generated Text Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report documents the development, test, and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated text analysis, with a specific focus on gambling-like elements in digital games, such as lootboxes. The project aimed not only to analyse user opinions and attitudes towards these mechanics, but also to advance methodological research in text analysis. By employing prompting techniques and iterative prompt refinement processes, the study sought to test and improve the accuracy of LLM-based text analysis. The findings indicate that while LLMs can effectively identify relevant patterns and themes on par with human coders, there are still challenges in handling more complex tasks, underscoring the need for ongoing refinement in methodologies. The methodological advancements achieved through this study significantly enhance the application of LLMs in real-world text analysis. The research provides valuable insights into how these models can be better utilized to analyze complex, user-generated content.</description>

      <title>Does Low Spoilage Under Cold Conditions Foster Cultural Complexity During the Foraging Era? -- A Theoretical and Computational Inquiry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cultural complexity did not arise in a vacuum. Scholars in the humanities and social sciences have long debated how ecological factors, such as climate and resource availability, enabled early hunter-gatherers to allocate time and energy beyond basic subsistence tasks. This paper presents a formal, interdisciplinary approach that integrates theoretical modeling with computational methods to examine whether conditions that allow lower spoilage of stored food, often associated with colder climates and abundant large fauna, could indirectly foster the emergence of cultural complexity. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a mathematical framework that relates spoilage rates, yield levels, resource management skills, and cultural activities. Under this framework, we prove that lower spoilage and adequate yields reduce the frequency of hunting, thus freeing substantial time for cultural pursuits. Second, we implement a reinforcement learning simulation, inspired by engineering optimization techniques, to validate the theoretical predictions. By training agents in different $(Y,p)$ environments, where $Y$ is yield and $p$ is the probability of daily spoilage, we observe patterns consistent with the theoretical model: stable conditions with lower spoilage strongly correlate with increased cultural complexity. While we do not claim to replicate prehistoric social realities directly, our results suggest that ecologically stable niches provided a milieu in which cultural forms could germinate and evolve. This study, therefore, offers an integrative perspective that unites humanistic inquiries into the origins of culture with the formal rigor and exploratory power of computational modeling.</description>

      <title>The Informational Role of Online Recommendations: Evidence from a Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a field experiment on a movie-recommendation platform to investigate whether and how online recommendations influence consumption choices. Using a within-subjects design, our experiment measures the causal effect of recommendations on consumption and decomposes the relative importance of two economic mechanisms: expanding consumers' consideration sets and providing information about their idiosyncratic match value. We find that the informational component exerts a stronger influence - recommendations shape consumer beliefs, which in turn drive consumption, particularly among less experienced consumers. Our findings and experimental design provide valuable insights for the economic evaluation and optimisation of online recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>It Takes Three to Ceilidh: Pension System and Multidimensional Poverty Mitigation in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research employs the Alkire-Foster approach to measure multidimensional poverty between 2012 and 2020 in China, followed by examining the role of the three-pillar pension system in mitigating household multidimensional poverty. With the China Family Panel Studies data, our measurement uncovers the sustainable effects and mechanisms of household participation in the multi-pillar pension system on poverty mitigation. The results indicate that more participation in the pension system mitigates the probability of being trapped in multidimensional poverty. The findings reveal the significance of state social insurance, enterprise annuity, and individual commercial insurance. The mitigation effect of market-oriented pillars is achieved through more investment in and consumption for livelihood assets. Based upon the sustainable livelihoods framework, livelihood assets ameliorate household capabilities in human, natural, financial, and psychological capital against risks, shocks, and uncertainties. Our research contributes to the knowledge of how household participation in pension pillars sustainably mitigates multidimensional poverty through micro-level mechanisms and to the policy praxis of why a facilitating state is called for poverty mitigation from the perspective of new structural economics.</description>

      <title>Follow the money: a startup-based measure of AI exposure across occupations, industries and regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the workplace is advancing rapidly, necessitating robust metrics to evaluate its tangible impact on the labour market. Existing measures of AI occupational exposure largely focus on AI's theoretical potential to substitute or complement human labour on the basis of technical feasibility, providing limited insight into actual adoption and offering inadequate guidance for policymakers. To address this gap, we introduce the AI Startup Exposure (AISE) index-a novel metric based on occupational descriptions from O*NET and AI applications developed by startups funded by the Y Combinator accelerator. Our findings indicate that while high-skilled professions are theoretically highly exposed according to conventional metrics, they are heterogeneously targeted by startups. Roles involving routine organizational tasks-such as data analysis and office management-display significant exposure, while occupations involving tasks that are less amenable to AI automation due to ethical or high-stakes, more than feasibility, considerations -- such as judges or surgeons -- present lower AISE scores. By focusing on venture-backed AI applications, our approach offers a nuanced perspective on how AI is reshaping the labour market. It challenges the conventional assumption that high-skilled jobs uniformly face high AI risks, highlighting instead the role of today's AI players' societal desirability-driven and market-oriented choices as critical determinants of AI exposure. Contrary to fears of widespread job displacement, our findings suggest that AI adoption will be gradual and shaped by social factors as much as by the technical feasibility of AI applications. This framework provides a dynamic, forward-looking tool for policymakers and stakeholders to monitor AI's evolving impact and navigate the changing labour landscape.</description>

      <title>VickreyFeedback: Cost-efficient Data Construction for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over outputs of large language models (LLM)s to instill human expectations into LLMs. Although preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic utility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What exacerbates this situation is that, given complex intransitive or cyclic relationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs are still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe cost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data accumulate over time. In this paper, we discuss the fine-tuning of LLMs as a monetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency of preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an auction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency of RLHF, while maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-effective for fine-tuning LLMs concentrating on high-quality feedback.</description>
