      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of a hanging string with a freely pivoting attached mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the natural resonant frequency of a suspended flexible string is significantly modified (by one order of magnitude) by adding a freely pivoting attached mass at its lower end. This articulated system then exhibits complex nonlinear dynamics such as bending oscillations, similar to those of a swing becoming slack, thereby strongly modifying the system resonance that is found to be controlled by the length of the pivoting mass. The dynamics is experimentally studied using a remote and noninvasive magnetic parametric forcing. To do so, a permanent magnet is suspended by a flexible string above a vertically oscillating conductive plate. Harmonic and period-doubling instabilities are experimentally reported and are modeled using the Hill equation, leading to analytical solutions that accurately describe the experimentally observed tonguelike instability curves.</description>

      <title>Third order interactions shift the critical coupling in multidimensional Kuramoto models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of higher order interactions in the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators has been a topic of intense recent research. Arguments based on dimensional reduction using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz show that such interactions usually facilitate synchronization, giving rise to bi-stability and hysteresis. Here we show that three body interactions shift the critical coupling for synchronization towards higher values in all dimensions, except D=2, where a cancellation occurs. After the transition, three and four body interactions combine to facilitate synchronization. We show simulations in D=3 and 4 to illustrate the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of a Discrete Conservation Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann problem for the discrete conservation law $2 \dot{u}_n + u^2_{n+1} - u^2_{n-1} = 0$ is classified using Whitham modulation theory, a quasi-continuum approximation, and numerical simulations. A surprisingly elaborate set of solutions to this simple discrete regularization of the inviscid Burgers' equation is obtained. In addition to discrete analogues of well-known dispersive hydrodynamic solutions -- rarefaction waves (RWs) and dispersive shock waves (DSWs) -- additional unsteady solution families and finite time blow-up are observed. Two solution types exhibit no known conservative continuum correlates: (i) a counterpropagating DSW and RW solution separated by a symmetric, stationary shock and (ii) an unsteady shock emitting two counter-propagating periodic wavetrains with the same frequency connected to a partial DSW or a RW. Another class of solutions called traveling DSWs, (iii), consists of a partial DSW connected to a traveling wave comprised of a periodic wavetrain with a rapid transition to a constant. Portions of solutions (ii) and (iii) are interpreted as shock solutions of the Whitham modulation equations.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of hyperbolic reaction-diffusion systems on directed networks through the generalized Routh-Hurwitz criterion for complex polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of dynamical systems on complex networks is of paramount importance in engineering, given that many natural and artificial systems find a natural embedding on discrete topologies. For instance, power grids, chemical reactors and the brain, to name a few, can be modeled through the network formalism by considering elementary units coupled via the links. In recent years, scholars have developed numerical and theoretical tools to study the stability of those coupled systems when subjected to perturbations. In such framework, it was found that asymmetric couplings enhance the possibilities for such systems to become unstable. Moreover, in this scenario the polynomials whose stability needs to be studied bear complex coefficients, which makes the analysis more difficult. In this work, we put to use a recent extension of the well-known Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion, allowing to treat the complex coefficient case. Then, using the Brusselator model as a case study, we discuss the stability conditions and the regions of parameters when the networked system remains stable.</description>

      <title>Detecting self-organising patterns in crowd motion: Effect of optimisation algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalating process of urbanization has raised concerns about incidents arising from overcrowding, necessitating a deep understanding of large human crowd behavior and the development of effective crowd management strategies. This study employs computational methods to analyze real-world crowd behaviors, emphasizing self-organizing patterns. Notably, the intersection of two streams of individuals triggers the spontaneous emergence of striped patterns, validated through both simulations and live human experiments. Addressing a gap in computational methods for studying these patterns, previous research utilized the pattern-matching technique, employing the Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm for fitting a two-dimensional sinusoidal function to pedestrian coordinates. This paper advances the pattern-matching procedure by introducing Simulated Annealing as the optimization algorithm and employing a two-dimensional square wave for data fitting. The amalgamation of Simulated Annealing and the square wave significantly enhances pattern fitting quality, validated through statistical hypothesis tests. The study concludes by outlining potential applications of this method across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Spatiotemporal Pattern Formation in Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamics of time varying photonic media with an optical Kerr nonlinearity and an associated phase transition. The interplay between a periodically modulated permittivity and the nonlinearity induces a continuous transition of electromagnetic waves to a state with broken spatial and time translation symmetries. This transition gives rise to a lattice-like wave pattern, in many ways similar to a spatial crystallization in solids. Symmetry breaking triggers the emergence of soft, Goldstone-like modes, which propagate as deformations of the lattice structure, as well as massive Higgs-like modes - spatially uniform oscillations of the field amplitude. We extend the analysis of the non-equlibrium symmetry breaking to 2+1 dimensional time varying media and discuss pattern formation as well as the connection to discrete time crystals.</description>

      <title>Role of wave scattering in instability-induced Langmuir circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a classical problem about dynamic instability that leads to the Langmuir circulation. The problem statement assumes that there is initially a wind-driven shear flow and a plane surface wave propagating in the direction of the flow. The unstable mode is a superposition of i) shear flow and ii) surface waves both modulated in the horizontal spanwise direction and iii) circulation that is made up with vortices forming near-surface rolls whose axis are coaligned along the shear flow streamlines and whose transverse size corresponds to the modulation period. Usually, the Langmuir circulation is understood as the vortical part of the mode slowly varying in time, which is the combination of the first and the last flows. The novelty of our approach is that we, firstly, take into account the scattering of the initial surface wave on the slow current. Second, we find the interference of the scattered and the initial waves generating a Stokes drift modulated in the same direction. Third, we establish the subsequent affect of the circulation by the vortex force created by the nonlinear interaction of the initial shear flow and the modulated part of the Stokes drift. S. Leibovich &amp; A.D.D. Craik previously showed that the third part of the mechanism could maintain the Langmuir circulation. We calculate the growth rate which is approximately twice smaller than that obtained by A.D.D. Craik. The vertical structure of the circulation in the mode consists of two vortices, that corresponds to the next mode in Craik's model. Considering the wave scattering, we describe the fast-wave motion as a potential flow with relatively weak vortical correction. Application of the technique can be expanded on other flows where fast oscillating surface waves coexist with a slow current.</description>
