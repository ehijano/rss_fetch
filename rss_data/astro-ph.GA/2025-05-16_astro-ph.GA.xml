      <title>Chandra Rules Out Super-Eddington Accretion For Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high-redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. As the most natural explanation, high obscuration, is disfavored by JWST spectroscopic evidence, several authors have suggested that the X-ray weakness of LRDs is intrinsic, due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we test that scenario by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration ($N_H\gtrsim10^{25}$~cm$^{-2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous measurements of proximity zone sizes for 59 quasars in the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overionized regions surrounding high-redshift quasars, known as proximity zones, provide a window into the interaction between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization (EoR). We present new homogeneous measurements of proximity zone sizes ($R_{\mathrm{p}}$) for a sample of $59$ quasars spanning redshifts $5.77 \leq z \leq 7.54$ (median $z = 6.59$). For $15$ of these sources, we measure $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ for the first time. The quasars in our catalog have absolute magnitudes at rest-frame $1450$ \r{A} in the range $-29.13 \leq M_{1450} \leq -25.20$ (median $M_{1450} \simeq -26.49$), providing one of the most extensive data sets for exploring $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ at these epochs. The distribution of $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ values shows a large scatter at fixed redshift and luminosity, likely reflecting variations in quasar lifetimes ($t_{\mathrm{Q}}$), IGM density fluctuations, and IGM neutral fraction. We fit a bivariate power-law model to a large sample of $100$ objects to study the dependence of $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ with both $M_{1450}$ and $z$: we find that the evolution of $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ with luminosity is in agreement with the models ($R_{\mathrm{p}} \propto 10^{-0.4 M_{1450}/2.87}$), while the evolution of $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ with $z$ is steeper than previous works ($R_{\mathrm{p}} \propto (1+z)^{-2.44}$). We identify $13$ quasars with small proximity zone size, defined using the residuals of our fit. In all cases, except for J2211$-$6320, we rule out the presence of associated dense absorbers that prematurely truncate $R_{\mathrm{p}}$, and suggest a short $t_{\mathrm{Q}}$ ($\lesssim 10^4$ yr) as a possible explanation for their small proximity zone sizes.</description>

      <title>Growth of black holes at the centre of early-type galaxies in MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in early-type galaxies (ETGs) is a key challenge for galaxy formation theories. Using the monolithic collapse models of ETGs formed in Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) from Eappen et al. (2022), we investigate the conditions necessary to form SMBHs in MOND and test whether these systems adhere to observed SMBH-galaxy scaling relations. We analyse the evolution of the gravitational potential and gas inflow rates in the model relics with a total stellar mass ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 times 10^11 solar masses. The gravitational potential exhibits a rapid deepening during the initial galaxy formation phase, accompanied by high gas inflow rates. These conditions suggest efficient central gas accumulation capable of fueling SMBH formation. We further examine the MBH - sigma relation by assuming that a fraction of the central stellar mass contributes to black hole formation. Black hole masses derived from 10 to 100 percent of the central mass are comparable with the observed relation, particularly at higher central velocity dispersions (sigma greater than 200 km/s). This highlights the necessity of substantial inner mass collapse to produce SMBHs consistent with observations. Our results demonstrate that MOND dynamics, through the rapid evolution of the gravitational potential and sustained gas inflows, provide a favorable environment for SMBH formation in ETGs. These findings support the hypothesis that MOND can naturally account for the observed SMBH-galaxy scaling relations without invoking cold dark matter, emphasizing the importance of early gas dynamics in determining final SMBH properties.</description>

      <title>SCUBADive II: Searching for $z&gt;4$ Dust-Obscured Galaxies via F150W-Dropouts in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of dust in the cosmic star formation budget remains highly uncertain, especially at $z&gt;4$, where accurate bookkeeping of the dust-obscured component proves difficult. We address this shortcoming with SCUBADive, a compilation of the \jwst\ counterparts of (sub-)millimeter galaxies, in order to further analyze the distribution and properties of massive dust-obscured galaxies at early times. In this paper, we present a subset of SCUBADive, focusing on 60 ``dark'' galaxies that dropout at 1.5\micron. Motivated by \jwst\ observations of AzTECC71, a far-infrared bright F150W-dropout with $z_{\rm phot}=5.7^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$, we complete a systematic search of F150W-dropouts with SCUBA-2 and ALMA detections to find the highest redshift dusty galaxies. Within our subsample, 16 are most similar to AzTECC71 due to faint F444W magnitudes ($&gt;24$\,mag) and lack of counterparts in COSMOS2020. Despite high star formation rates ($\langle$SFR$\rangle=550^{+500}_{-360}$\,\mdot\,yr$^{-1}$) and large stellar masses ($\langle$log$_{10}$(\mstar)$\rangle=11.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$\,\mdot), these galaxies may not be particularly extreme for their presumed epochs according to offsets from the main sequence. We find that heavily obscured galaxies, which have inadvertently been omitted by past galaxy evolution studies, comprise roughly 20\% of their host population by mass. This population may, however, contribute significantly to the high mass end (log$_{10}$(\mstar/\mdot)$&gt;11$) of the $z&gt;4$ stellar mass function as up to 60\% could have been missed from previous studies.</description>

      <title>A PAH deficit in the starburst core of a distant spiral galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution and spatially-matched observations with JWST and ALMA of a starburst galaxy (PACS-830) at $z=1.46$. The NIRCam observations mainly trace the stellar light while the CO ($J$=5--4) observations map the dense molecular gas at kpc scales. Both datasets reveal the morphology to be that of a gas/dust rich bulge with two extending arms, together resembling a grand-design spiral galaxy. The more pronounced arm contributes 21 $\pm$ 6\% of the total CO emission. These results demonstrate that starburst activity at high redshift can be triggered, without undergoing a highly disruptive major merger. We assess the strength and distribution of star formation using two tracers: (1) Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission detected at $8~\mu$m ($L_8$) with a MIRI/F1800W image, and (2) $L_\mathrm{IR}$, inferred from the CO ($J$=5--4) map. The spatial profiles of the $L_\mathrm{IR}$ and $L_8$ are dissimilar, thus leading to a significant deficit of mid-IR ($L_8$) emission in the nucleus. We hypothesize that this is due to the destruction of PAH molecules by the intense ionizing radiation field or decreased emission in the photodissociation region, as seen in nearby star-forming regions and consistent with the galaxy-wide properties of distant starbursts. This study reveals spatial variations in the $L_8$ to $L_\mathrm{IR}$ ratio for the first time at $z&gt;1$, in agreement with expectations from theory. Our analysis underscores the pivotal role of joint high-resolution observations with JWST and ALMA in discerning the different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) and revealing internal physics in galaxy substructures.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quasar Variability With ZTF at 0&lt;z&lt;3: A Universal Relation with Eddington Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars, powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), exhibit significant variability, offering insights into the physics of accretion and the properties of the central engines. In this study, we analyze photometric variability and its correlation with key quasar properties, including black hole mass ($M_{\mathrm{BH}}$) and nuclear luminosities, using 915 quasars with $0\leq z&lt;3.0$ from the AQMES sample monitored within SDSS-V. Variability metrics were derived from approximately 6-year light curves provided by the Zwicky Transient Facility -- ZTF, while SMBH masses and luminosities were obtained from the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog of \citet{wu2022catalog}. We identify a strong anti-correlation between variability amplitude and luminosity, which strengthens with redshift, and a redshift-dependent trend for $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$: a positive correlation at low redshifts, no significant correlation at intermediate redshifts, and an anti-correlation the highest redshifts. Our main finding is a robust anti-correlation between photometric variability amplitude and Eddington ratio, consistent across redshift bins. We present a general equation encapsulating this relationship, that appears to be almost free of redshift dependence, enabling predictions of quasar variability based on accretion parameters {\bf or vice-versa}. The derived relation with the Eddington ratio provides a unified framework for interpreting variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and facilitates future studies of quasar variability using high-cadence surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time -- LSST.</description>

      <title>Virgo Filaments V: Disrupting the Baryon Cycle in the NGC 5364 Galaxy Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virgo Filament Survey (VFS) is a comprehensive study of galaxies that reside in the extended filamentary structures surrounding the Virgo Cluster, out to 12 virial radii. The primary goal is to characterize all of the dominant baryonic components within galaxies and to understand whether and how they are affected by the filament environment. A key constituent of VFS is a narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging survey of over 600 galaxies, VFS-H$\alpha$. The H$\alpha$ images reveal detailed, resolved maps of the ionized gas and massive star-formation. This imaging is particularly powerful as a probe of environmentally-induced quenching because different physical processes affect the spatial distribution of star formation in different ways. In this paper, we present the first results from the VFS-H$\alpha$ for the NGC~5364 group, a low-mass ($\log_{10}(M_{dyn}/M_\odot) &lt; 13)$ system located at the western edge of the Virgo~III filament. We combine H$\alpha$ imaging with resolved H~I observations from MeerKAT for eight group members. These galaxies exhibit peculiar morphologies, including strong distortions in the stars and the gas, truncated H~I and H$\alpha$ disks, H~I tails, extraplanar H$\alpha$ emission, and off-center H$\alpha$ emission. These signatures are suggestive of environmental processing such as tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping, and starvation. We quantify the role of ram pressure stripping expected in this group, and find that it can explain the cases of H~I tails and truncated H-alpha for all but one of the disk-dominated galaxies. Our observations indicate that multiple physical mechanisms are disrupting the baryon cycle in these group galaxies.</description>

      <title>LITMUS: Bayesian Lag Recovery in Reverberation Mapping with Fast Differentiable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping is a technique in which the mass of a Seyfert I galaxy's central supermassive black hole is estimated, along with the system's physical scale, from the timescale at which variations in brightness propagate through the galactic nucleus. This mapping allows for a long baseline of time measurements to extract spatial information beyond the angular resolution of our telescopes, and is the main means of constraining supermassive black hole masses at high redshift. The most recent generation of multi-year reverberation mapping campaigns for large numbers of active galactic nuclei (e.g. OzDES) have had to deal with persistent complications of identifying false positives, such as those arising from aliasing due to seasonal gaps in time-series data. We introduce LITMUS (Lag Inference Through the Mixed Use of Samplers), a modern lag recovery tool built on the "damped random walk" model of quasar variability, built in the autodiff framework JAX. LITMUS is purpose built to handle the multimodal aliasing of seasonal observation windows and provides evidence integrals for model comparison, a more quantified alternative to existing methods of lag validation. LITMUS also offers a flexible modular framework for extending modelling of AGN variability, and includes JAX-enabled implementations of other popular lag recovery methods like nested sampling and the interpolated cross correlation function. We test LITMUS on a number of mock light curves modelled after the OzDES sample and find that it recovers their lags with high precision and a successfully identifies spurious lag recoveries, reducing its false positive rate to drastically outperform the state of the art program JAVELIN. LITMUS's high performance is accomplished by an algorithm for mapping the Bayesian posterior density which both constrains the lag and offers a Bayesian framework for model null hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>VUV Processing of Nitrile Ice: Direct Comparison of Branching in Ice and TPD Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between radiation chemistry and sublimation dynamics of condensed organic compounds on cold grains is fundamental to describe observed gas-phase and ice-phase molecular abundances in the ISM. Infrared measurements are generally used to identify molecules synthesized in irradiated ices in lab experiments, while mass spectrometric techniques have been used to monitor the products following temperature programmed desorption. The IR measurements are often used quantitatively to monitor chemical transformation of ices during the course of irradiation, but the gas phase methods applied with TPD generally do not permit quantitative branching determination. Here we combine reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) of ices with broadband rotational spectroscopy of the sublimed products, to study the branching of photoproducts produced by the VUV irradiation of condensed CH3CN and CH3CH2CN ices. This permits direct comparison between the ice-phase and gas-phase branching following temperature programmed desorption. This comparison is analogous to astronomical observations of ices in protostellar disks such as by the James Webb Space Telescope employed in conjunction with ALMA observations in the corresponding warm-up regions of the same objects. In the condensed CH3CN VUV processed ices we quantified the HCN, CH3NC, CH2CCNH, CH3NH2, and CH4 abundances. The CH3CH2CN ices also readily produced the corresponding isocyanide and HCN in addition to a significant yield of CH2CHCN. The ethyl cyanide ice produced CH3CHNH rather than CH3NH2 and no CH4 formation was observed. In the gas phase we detected the isocyanides, HCN and vinyl cyanide. The ice and gas phase relative abundances could be brought into agreement if the unknown IR band strength of the isocyanides C-N stretch is assumed to be ~3 times larger than that of the cyanides.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole mass measurement in the spiral galaxy NGC 4736 Using JWST/NIRSpec stellar kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present accurate mass measurements of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in NGC 4736 (M 94).\ We used the ``gold-standard" stellar absorption features (CO band heads) at $\sim$2.3 ${\rm \mu m}$, as opposed to gas emission lines, to trace the dynamics in the nuclear region, easily resolving the SMBH's sphere of influence. The analysis uses observations made with the integral field unit of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope and a surface brightness profile derived from {\it Hubble} Space Telescope archival images. We used Jeans anisotropic models within a Bayesian framework, and comprehensive Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization, to determine the best-fit black hole mass, orbital anisotropy, mass-to-light ratio, and nucleus kinematical inclination. We obtained a SMBH mass $M_{\rm BH}=(1.60\pm0.16)\times10^7$ M$_\odot$ (1$\sigma$ random error), which is consistent with the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma$ and $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_\star$ relations. This is the first dynamical measurement of a $M_{\rm BH}$ in NGC 4736 based on the stellar kinematics observed with NIRSpec. We thus settle a longstanding inconsistency between estimates based on nuclear emission-line tracers and the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma$ relation. Our analysis shows that NIRSpec can detect SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH,min}\approx 5\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ in galaxies within 5 Mpc and $\sigma\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$</description>

      <title>"Ashfall" Induced by Molecular Outflow in Protostar Evolution. II. Analytical Study on the Maximum Size of Dust Grains Lifted by Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dust dynamics in the molecular outflow using an analytical magnetohydrodynamical outflow model. Specifically, we investigate the maximum size of dust grains $a_{\rm d,max}$ that can be lifted by the outflow and whether they can escape into interstellar space. We also investigate the dependence of the maximum size of the dust grains on various outflow parameters, such as the mass ejection rate of the outflow $\dot{M}$, the disk size $r_{\rm disk}$, the mass of the central protostar $M_{*}$ and the internal dust density $\rho_{\rm mat}$. We find the empirical formula for the maximum dust size as a function of the outflow parameters. $a_{\rm d,max}$ depends on the parameters as $a_{\rm d,max}$ $\propto$ $\dot{M}^{1.0}$ $r_{\rm disk}^{-0.44}$ $M_{*}^{-0.82}$ $\rho_{\rm mat}^{-1.0}$. We also find that the dust grains with size of 100 $\rm \mu$m to 1 mm can be lifted by the outflow and can distribute in the well outside of the disk when the mass ejection rate of the outflow has the value of $10^{-7}\,M_{\odot}\rm \,yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}\,M_{\odot}\rm \,yr^{-1}$. This result is consistent with recent observations that show a correlation between the mass ejection rate of the outflow and the spectral index $\beta$ of the dust opacity at the envelope scale.</description>

      <title>Clumpy Starburst in a Local Dwarf Galaxy, NGC 1522</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the star-forming process in nearby dwarf galaxies, we present Integral Field Units (IFU) observation of the star-forming dwarf galaxy, NGC 1522, with the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) as a part of Dwarf Galaxy Integral Survey (DGIS). Our observation reveals the presence of a star-forming clumpy ring in its central region. We identify nine distinct star-forming clumps based on extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ emission-line map, with the total star formation rate (SFR) of about 0.1 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The nine clumps are considered to be starbursts, which represent an extreme case in the local universe, without invoking major merging. We investigate the properties of ionized gas using the strong emission lines and `BPT' diagrams, in conjunction with the velocity mapping. Our analysis unveils intriguing patterns, including the positive metallicity gradient and low N/O abundance ratio. This peculiar distribution of metallicity may signify external gas accretion. Our results suggest that the ongoing star formation in NGC 1522 might be triggered and sustained by the inflow of external metal-poor gas.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of halo and quasar properties in dense environments: CARLA J1017+6116 at z=2.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-loud active galactic nuclei, in particular radio-loud quasars, are fueled by accretion onto supermassive black holes and are among the most energetic sources in the Universe. While their impact on their surroundings - from the interstellar medium to the circumgalactic medium - is well recognized, the specific mechanisms remain uncertain. In this study we analyze deep Keck Cosmic Web Imager observations of the Lyman-alpha (Lya) halo surrounding the radio-loud quasar at the center of the cluster CARLA J1017+6116 at redshift z = 2.8. As is known from previous observations, the cluster hosts a high fraction of early-type galaxies, and the star formation of its spectroscopically confirmed cluster members is typical of or higher than that of galaxies on the main sequence. We find that the Lya halo extends at least 16 arcsec (128 pkpc) down to a surface brightness level of 1e-19 erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, with a total observed Lya luminosity of log10(L/Lsun) = 43.35 +- 0.05. The halo has distinct kinematic regions with asymmetries suggestive of complex interactions between the quasar and the intracluster medium, possibly driven by a combination of biconical feedback and episodic activity. Despite the quasar classification, our reanalysis of very long baseline interferometry data finds no evidence of extended jet structures; we instead find compact and variable radio emission that could indicate episodic jet activity or suppression by the dense interstellar medium. Combining these observations with imaging obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, we identified one Lya-emitting source within the quasar halo. While mechanical feedback from a jet appears limited or episodic, radiative feedback likely plays a dominant role in shaping the extended Lya halo, highlighting the complex interplay between quasar-driven processes and the surrounding dense environment.</description>

      <title>Star formation efficiency and scaling relations in parsec-scale cluster-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations predict that clumps ($\sim$1 pc) should form stars at high efficiency to produce bound star clusters. We conducted a statistical study of 17 nearby cluster-forming clumps to examine the star formation rate and gas mass surface density relations (i.e. $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ vs. $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}$) at the clump scale. Using near-infrared point sources and Herschel dust continuum analysis, we obtained the radius, age, and stellar mass for most clusters in the ranges 0.5$-$1.6 pc, 0.5$-$1.5 Myr, 40$-$500 M$_\odot$, respectively, and also found that they are associated with $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}$ values ranging from 80$-$600 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. We obtained the best-fit scaling relations as $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ $\propto$ $\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}^{1.46}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}$ $\propto$ $(\Sigma_{\rm{gas}}/t_{\rm{ff}})^{0.80}$ for the studied sample of clumps. Comparing our results with existing scaling relations at cloud and extragalactic scales, we found that while the power-law exponent obtained in this work is similar to those found at these scales, the star formation rate surface densities are relatively higher for similar gas mass surface densities. From this work, we obtained instantaneous median star formation efficiency (SFE) and efficiency per free-fall time ($\epsilon_{\rm{ff}}$) of $\sim$20% and $\sim$13%, respectively, for the studied clumps. We discuss the cause of the obtained high SFE and $\epsilon_{\rm{ff}}$ in the studied clumps and also discuss the results in the context of bound cluster formation within molecular clouds. We conclude that our results do not favour a universal scaling law with a constant value of $\epsilon_{\rm{ff}}$ in star-forming systems across different scales.</description>

      <title>First polarization study of the M87 jet and active galactic nuclei at submillimeter wavelengths with ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present full-polarization observations at $\lambda = 0.87$ mm (345 GHz) conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward Messier 87 (M87) and seven other radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). We determine polarization and Faraday properties of the targets, with linear polarization (LP) fractions spanning 1\% to 17\%, and Faraday rotation measures (RMs) exceeding $10^{5}$ rad m$^{-2}$. These RM values, 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than typically observed at $\lambda &gt; 3$ mm, suggest denser Faraday screens or stronger magnetic fields in the (sub)millimeter emission regions. Additionally, we present the first submillimeter polarized images of the M87 jet and the observed AGN. In the M87 jet, we identify RM gradients and sign reversals, suggestive of a helical magnetic field structure extending over kiloparsec scales. These observations were part of the ALMA Band~7 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) commissioning during the April 2021 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) campaign. The results provide essential constraints for calibrating, analyzing, and interpreting VLBI data from the EHT at 345 GHz, representing a critical step toward submillimeter VLBI imaging.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Milky Way's Star Formation at Cosmic Noon with High Proper-Motion Stars: A Precursor to the Merger-Driven Starburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence suggests that the Milky Way (MW) underwent a major collision with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy around cosmic noon. While GSE has since been fully disrupted, it brought in ex-situ stars and dynamically heated in-situ stars into the halo. In addition, the gas-rich merger may have triggered a burst of in-situ star formation, potentially giving rise to a chemically distinct stellar component. We investigate the region of phase space where stars formed during the GSE merger likely reside, and retain distinct chemical and dynamical signatures. Building on our previous investigation of metallicity ([Fe/H]) and vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$) distributions, we analyse spectroscopic samples from GALAH, APOGEE, SDSS, and LAMOST, combined with Gaia kinematics. We focus on high proper-motion stars as effective tracers of the phase-space volume likely influenced by the GSE merger. To correct for selection effects, we incorporate metallicity estimates derived from SDSS and SMSS photometry. Our analysis reveals that low-$\alpha$ stars with GSE-like kinematics exhibit bimodality in [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] at $-1.0 \lesssim {\rm [Fe/H]} \lesssim -0.4$. One group follows the low light-element abundances of GSE stars, while another exhibits enhanced values. These low-$\alpha$, high-Na stars have eccentric orbits, but are more confined to the inner MW. A subset of these stars overlaps with the Eos population, representing only the high-eccentricity portion of a broader structure. After correcting for sampling biases, we find that the population comprises $\sim7\%$ relative to the GSE debris. These results suggest that the low-$\alpha$, high-Na stars formed in a compact region, likely fueled by gas from the GSE progenitor, analogous to clumpy star-forming clouds seen in high-redshift galaxies. Such stars may trace the first sparks of more extensive merger-driven starburst activity.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning to Estimate NUV Magnitudes and Probe Quenching Mechanisms of $z$=0 Nuggets in the RESOLVE and ECO Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a $z=0$ census of nuggets -- compact galaxies that form via gas-rich violent disk instability -- within the luminosity- and volume-limited REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) and Environmental COntext (ECO) surveys. We use random forest (RF) models to predict near-ultraviolet (NUV) magnitudes for ECO galaxies that lack high-quality NUV magnitudes, thereby doubling the number of ECO galaxies with reliable extinction-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) and red/green/blue classifications based on specific SFRs (sSFRs). The resulting RF-enhanced RESOLVE+ECO nugget sample allows us to analyze rare subpopulations -- green nuggets and nuggets with active galactic nuclei (AGN) -- likely associated with quenching. Green nuggets are more similar to red nuggets than to blue nuggets in halo mass ($M_{\text{halo}}$) distribution, with both red and green nuggets being found mainly at $M_{\text{halo}} \ge 10^{11.4} M_\odot$, where permanent halo quenching is predicted. At these masses, the AGN frequency for green nuggets is higher ($\text{48.2\%}^{+5.3\%}_{-5.3\%}$) than for either blue ($\text{39.2\%}^{+2.9\%}_{-2.8\%}$) or red ($\text{29.3\%}^{+3.0\%}_{-2.8\%}$) nuggets. Between $M_{halo} = 10^{11.4}-10^{12} M_\odot$, at the onset of permanent quenching, the AGN frequency for green nuggets is nearly double the frequency for blue or red nuggets, implying AGN are associated with this transition. At $M_{halo} &lt; 10^{11.4} M_\odot$, where temporary cyclic quenching is expected, the AGN frequency for blue nuggets ($\text{7.5\%}^{+1.4\%}_{-1.2\%}$) is lower than for either green ($\text{31.3\%}^{+8.7\%}_{-7.5\%}$) or red ($\text{18.8\%}^{+11.5\%}_{-7.8\%}$) nuggets. At all masses, nuggets with AGN have reduced sSFRs and likely also atomic gas content compared to nuggets without AGN, but the quenching is more extreme below $M_{halo} = 10^{11.4} M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Structural parameters, chronological age and dynamical age of the LMC globular cluster NGC 1754</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of a new systematic study of the properties of the most compact and massive star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), here we present the determination of the chronological age, the structural parameters, and the dynamical age of NGC 1754. We used high-resolution images taken with the WFC3/HST instrument, both in optical and near-ultraviolet filters. The high quality of the images made it possible to construct the star density profile from resolved star counts, and to fit the observed profile with an appropriate King model to obtain the structural parameters (e.g. core, half-mass, and tidal radii). Our findings confirm that NGC 1754 is a very compact globular cluster with a core radius of only 0.84 pc. The analysis of the same dataset allowed us to confirm a very old age ($t=12.8\pm0.4$ Gyr) for this system, thus further consolidating the indication that the process of globular cluster formation started at the same cosmic time both in the LMC and in the Milky Way, independently of the characteristics of the host environment. We have also used the empirical method called ``dynamical clock'' to estimate the dynamical age of the system. This consists of quantifying the degree of central segregation of blue straggler stars (BSSs) using the $A^+_{rh}$ parameter, which is defined as the area enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a reference (lighter) population. This method yielded a value of $A^+_{rh}=0.31\pm0.07$, which is the highest measured so far for LMC clusters, pointing to an advanced dynamical age for the cluster, possibly on the verge of core collapse. The results presented here for NGC 1754 confirm that the natural dynamical evolution of globular clusters plays a role in shaping the age-core radius distributions observed in the LMC.</description>

      <title>Environmental dependences of galaxy properties in the southern regions of the GAMA survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical properties of galaxies are correlated with their local environment. Quantifying these environmental correlations is crucial for a better understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. In this work, we investigate how galaxy properties are correlated with the environment through spatial clustering measurements of galaxies. Using two-point correlation functions and marked correlation functions, we measure and compare the environmental dependence of colour, stellar mass, luminosities in the $u$, $g$, $r$, $J$, and $K$ bands, star formation rate, and specific star formation rate. We use galaxy samples from the southern (G02 and G23) regions of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Furthermore, we explore how redshift completeness affects clustering measurements by comparing different subsets of the G02 region with varying redshift completeness. We show that the $u-r$ and $g-r$ colours correlate the most with the local environment, with stellar mass being the next most reliable indicator of the environment. We also demonstrate that redshift completeness has a significant effect on clustering measurements.</description>

      <title>AGN star dynamics under the Influence of Outflow-Ambient Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars with outflows interacting with ambient gas experience accelerations arising from the gravitational feedback induced by the interaction structure. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) local shearing box simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of a star with outflows embedded in the outer regions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. Two types of stellar wind are considered: isotropic winds and axisymmetric jets, along with variations in the radial pressure gradient profile. The results show that anti-friction enables AGN stars to acquire angular momentum from the ambient gas, resulting in outward migration away from the disk center. The formation and stability of the head-wind structure, which is crucial for maintaining anti-friction, are sensitive to both the strength of the stellar outflow and the radial pressure gradient of the disk gas. Once the head-wind structure is disrupted, the anti-friction effect ceases to operate effectively. A case study is also presented, focusing on a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) in an AGN disk. It is shown that jet material launched along the z-axis is confined to the trailing side of the object's motion by high gas inflow velocities, thereby activating anti-friction and inducing outward migration. If such an sBH migrates inward initially, the interplay between inward and outward migration may trap it at an equilibrium radius, potentially facilitating the formation and merger of black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Radiative Transfer Calculation Based on a Physics-based Model of the Sub-parsec-scale Gases around an Active Galactic Nucleus and Its Application to NGC 3783</title>

Abstract: Although the X-ray spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies exhibit absorption lines of He-like iron and H-like iron at blue-shifted velocities of approximately $500 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the physical origin of these absorption lines remains uncertain. In this study, we performed X-ray radiative transfer based on the sub-parsec-scale thermally driven outflows. The initial step involved calculating the photoionization equilibrium using the Cloudy code, which is based on three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations. Subsequently, X-ray radiative transfer was performed using the Monte Carlo simulation for astrophysics and cosmology code. Our findings indicate that when the angle of inclination ranges from $55 \ \mathrm{degrees}$ to $65 \ \mathrm{degrees}$, the transmitted component of the X-ray spectrum displays absorption lines of He-like and H-like iron, exhibiting a blue shift of approximately $500 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The results suggest that the absorption lines are generated by a photoionized gas within $0.005 \ \mathrm{pc}$. Additionally, the results indicate that the scattered component of the X-ray spectrum exhibits emission lines originating from neutral iron fluorescence, He-like iron, and H-like iron. The emission lines are broadened by approximately $7000 \ \mathrm{km} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ due to the Keplerian rotation. Furthermore, the model reproduced the H-like iron and H-like iron absorption lines in NGC 3783 observed by the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Multi-Species Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of relativistic plasmas traditionally focus on the dynamics of two-species mixtures of charged particles under the influence of external magnetic fields and those generated by particle currents. However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A fully relativistic treatment of EMRIs in collisionless environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future mHz gravitational wave (GW) interferometers will precisely probe massive black hole environments, such as accretion discs, cold dark matter overdensities, and clouds of ultralight bosons, as long as we can accurately model the dephasing they induce on the waveform of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Most existing models rely on extrapolations from Newtonian results to model the interaction of the small black hole in an EMRI system with the environment surrounding the massive black hole. Here, we present a fully relativistic formalism to model such interaction with collisionless environments, focusing on the case of cold dark matter overdensities, like 'spikes' and 'mounds'. We implement our new formalism in the FastEMRIWaveforms framework and show that the resulting waveforms are significantly different from those based on a Newtonian treatment of environmental effects. Our results indicate that a fully relativistic treatment is essential to capture the environmental dephasing of GW signals from EMRIs accurately.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Infrared Spectroscopy of the Dust-Obscured Metal-Poor Open Cluster Trumpler 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trumpler 5 is a moderately old, dust-obscured metal-poor open cluster. In this study, high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic data of seven giant stars from the Trumpler 5 cluster were analyzed to derive chemical abundances for 20 elements and $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. Color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis of BV and Gaia photometry has also been performed for a comprehensive study of the cluster. Thanks to the methodology employed, some targets are studied for the first time. Additionally, it provides a detailed color-magnitude diagram analysis using photometric and spectroscopic data. We gathered high-resolution spectra for seven Trumpler 5 red giants in the near-infrared H and K wavelength domains, using the Immersion Grating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS). We introduced a method to initially estimate the stellar surface gravity (log g) by using calibrated equivalent widths of the Ti II line at 15873 {\AA} from a large sample. We performed standard spectroscopic analyses to refine the model atmospheric parameters of our targets and determined the chemical abundances primarily through spectrum synthesis. We also performed color-magnitude diagram analyses to extract differential reddening correction to compare cluster parameters both with and without corrections. We derived stellar parameters for seven members of Trumpler 5 with our method and the results are consistent with both the literature and other methods. We also inferred elemental abundances for more than 20 species, along with the $^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. The elemental abundances are in good agreement with the literature values for similar targets. Through CMD analysis, we found the reddening value, E(B-V)$\simeq$0.76 and estimated the age of the cluster to be approximately 2.50 Gyr.</description>

      <title>A hybrid SLAM-Payne framework for atmospheric parameter and abundance determination of early-type Stars from LAMOST DR9 low-resolution Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early-type stars are key drivers of Galactic chemical evolution, enriching the interstellar medium with alpha elements through powerful stellar winds and core-collapse supernovae, fueled by their short lifetimes and high masses. However, their spectra remain challenging to analyse due to rapid rotation, weak metal lines, and non-LTE effects. While large spectroscopic surveys provide extensive low-resolution data, extracting reliable parameters remains difficult due to methodological limitations for hot stars. Our goal is to develop a unified framework combining data-driven and synthetic spectral approaches to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances for hot stars using low-resolution spectra, addressing limitations in current methodologies while retaining critical spectral information. We present a hybrid approach integrating the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM) and the Payne frameworks, for low-resolution ($R\sim 1800$) spectra from LAMOST DR9. Our method preserves full spectral information including Balmer series and metal-line blends, employing neural-network interpolation for efficient parameter estimation ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log g$, and $v\sin i$) and abundance determination for O, Mg, Si, and Fe, across 8000 - 20000 K. We derive stellar parameters and abundances for 315,822 stars with $\mathrm{SNR} \geqslant 10$ in the $r$-band. Additionally, we detect abundance trends ([$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]) that exhibit temperature-dependent systematics and a distinct $\alpha$-poor stellar population within $0.0 \leqslant \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leqslant 0.5$ dex. The radial abundance gradients are negative and consistent with that derived from Cepheids, with a slope of $-0.070\pm0.007$ in \feh in the region $6 \leqslant R_\mathrm{GC}\leqslant 15$ kpc.</description>

      <title>Near-Infrared Spectroscopy of the Recurrent Nova M31N 2008-12a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near infrared (NIR) 0.9--2.5$\mu$m spectra of the remarkable recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a were obtained on days 6.3 and 10.3 after discovery of its 2024 outburst, and are the first NIR spectra of this object. The only prominent line seen in the spectra is that of HeI 1.083$\mu$m, on day 6.3. Apart from this HeI line, there are only two other weak emission features: one at 1.0786$\mu$m, suggested to be the [FeXIII] 1.075$\mu$m coronal line, and one unidentified feature at 1.0969$\mu$m. The observed full width at half maximum of the HeI line on day 6.3 (1350 km s$^{-1}$) is consistent with the behaviour of optical HeI lines during earlier eruptions of this RN, which show that the nova ejecta decelerate as they interact with the secondary's wind. The HeI 1.083$\mu$m line faded rapidly, and was absent in the day 10.3 spectrum, along with any other emission lines. We use the relative strengths of optical He and H lines in previous eruptions to estimate the expected strengths of the HeI 1.083$\mu$m line and of other infrared (including coronal) lines at 6.3 days after eruption. Our findings are consistent with the infrared spectra we observed during the 2024 eruption. We apply our analysis to account for the relative weakness of NIR coronal emission in known Galactic recurrent novae with giant secondaries.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter self-interaction from velocity distribution function in isolated halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-interactions facilitate inter-particle redistribution of energy within the dense regions of galactic halos, implying modifications in the density and velocity distribution of dark matter. Simulating dark-matter only isolated halos for a wide range of mass and specific self-scattering cross-sections, we make a systematic study of the impact of self-scattering on the velocity distribution profiles. We report a conservative bound on $\sigma/m$ $\leq 2.7 \rm cm^2/gm$ at $95\%$ C.L. from observations of rotation curves in Milky-Way size galaxies. Sub-leading bounds from LSB galaxy and clusters are also presented.</description>

      <title>Searching for Accreting Compact Binaries in eROSITA DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries with accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes are crucial for understanding accretion physics. In this study, we identify accreting compact binary candidates in the eROSITA DR1 by combining Gaia astrometry and ZTF time-domain photometry. We select accreting compact binary candidates whose X-ray emission is likely accretion-driven, based on their X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors, and further identify systems with short-period ZTF light curves, thereby ruling out AGNs. The resulting 22 candidates, including two known compact binaries, represent promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their accreting nature and explore their physical properties. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining X-ray-to-optical flux ratio and optical color, and time-domain photometry in selecting accreting compact binaries. The method is scalable and adaptable to future multi-wavelength sky surveys, offering a promising path toward a more complete census of compact binaries in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Catalogue of Ultracompact Mass-Transferring White Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an overview and catalogue of all known mass-transferring binary systems that have white dwarf accretors and orbital periods shorter than 70 minutes, including the AM CVn-type binary systems and a number of related objects. In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature background and describe recent breakthroughs, open questions, and connections to other fields. This overview is intended to provide a starting point for researchers who are relatively new to the fields of ultracompact binaries or AM CVn-type binaries. We define the scope of the catalogue (the criteria for inclusion) and describe its format and contents (what data have been included for each target). We also summarise the observed properties of the known mass-transferring ultracompact binaries, including their orbital periods and component stellar masses and radii. The catalogue presented here aims to provide a central resource to enable researchers to track the current status of the known sample. At the time of writing, the catalogue includes 123 confirmed binaries and 29 candidates. The catalogue is hosted on a public platform (Zenodo) with version control, and will be updated regularly.</description>

      <title>A non-axisymmetric potential for the Milky Way disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a purely dynamical global map of the non-axisymmetric structure of the Milky Way disk. For this, we exploit the information contained within the in-plane motions of disk stars from Gaia DR3 to adjust a model of the Galactic potential, including a detailed parametric form for the bar and spiral arms. We explore the parameter space of the non-axisymmetric components with the backward integration method, first adjusting the bar model to selected peaks of the stellar velocity distribution in the Solar neighbourhood, and then adjusting the amplitude, phase, pitch angle and pattern speed of spiral arms to the median radial velocity as a function of position within the disk. We check a posteriori that our solution also qualitatively reproduces various other features of the global non-axisymmetric phase-space distribution, including most of the moving groups and phase-space ridges despite those not being primarily used in the adjustment. This fiducial model has a bar with pattern speed $37~{\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm kpc}^{-1}$ and two spiral modes that are two-armed and three-armed respectively. The two-armed spiral mode has a $\sim 25~\%$ local contrast surface density, a low pattern speed of $13.1~{\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm kpc}^{-1}$, and matches the location of the Crux-Scutum, Local and Outer arm segments. The three-armed spiral mode has a $\sim 9~\%$ local contrast density, a slightly higher pattern speed of $16.4~{\rm kms}^{-1}{\rm kpc}^{-1}$, and matches the location of the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus arm segments. The Galactic bar, with a higher pattern speed than both spiral modes, has recently disconnected from those two arms. The fiducial non-axisymmetric potential presented in this paper, reproducing most non-axisymmetric signatures detected in the stellar kinematics of the Milky Way disk, can henceforth be used to confidently integrate orbits within the Galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Highly Variable Quasar Candidates Selected from 4XMM-DR13 with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sample of 12 quasar candidates with highly variable soft X-ray emission from the 4th XMM-newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (4XMM-DR13) using random forest. We obtained optical to mid-IR photometric data for the 4XMM-DR13 sources by correlating the sample with the SDSS DR18 photometric database and the AllWISE database. By cross-matching this sample with known spectral catalogs from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, we obtained a training data set containing stars, galaxies, and quasars. The random forest algorithm was trained to classify the XMM-WISE-SDSS sample. We further filtered the classified quasar candidates with $\it{Gaia}$ proper motion to remove stellar contaminants. Finally, 53,992 quasar candidates have been classified, with 10,210 known quasars matched in SIMBAD. The quasar candidates have systematically lower X-ray fluxes than quasars in the training set, which indicates the classifier is helpful to single out fainter quasars. We constructed a sample of 12 sources from these quasars candidates which changed their soft X-ray fluxes by a factor of 10 over $\sim$ 20 years in the 4XMM-newton survey. Our selected highly variable quasar candidates extend the quasar sample, characterized by extreme soft X-ray variability, to the optically faint end with magnitudes around $r \sim 22$. None of the 12 sources were detected in ROSAT observations. Given the flux limit of ROSAT, the result suggests that quasars exhibiting variations of more than two orders of magnitudes are extremely rare.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the environmental impact of cluster regions on the evolution of nearby S0 galaxies, focusing on their distinct quiescent and star-forming (SF) subpopulations. We select a sample of clusters by crossmatching optical and X-ray data and extract a subset of 14 systems with maximally relaxed cores by applying strict virialization and substructure tests. A projected phase space (PPS) diagram is generated from the stack of relaxed clusters up to 3 virial radii to assess the locations of quiescent and SF S0s and their cluster infall histories. Additionally, we compare the radial line-of-sight velocity dispersion (VDLOS) and specific star-formation rate (SSFR) profiles for the different S0 subpopulations, using other Hubble types as benchmarks. Our study shows that quiescent S0s, the dominant class in the entire cluster region, concentrate preferentially at low radii in the PPS diagram, while SF S0s are more abundant in the outskirts. Despite this segregation, both subpopulations show similar VDLOS profiles in the cluster core -indicating an advanced stage of dynamical relaxation-, but that resemble those of late-type galaxies beyond the virial radius. This finding, combined with the distinct PPS distributions of both S0 subpopulations, which lead to mean infall times $\sim 1$ Gyr longer for quiescent S0s but that are shorter than those expected for ancient infallers, suggests that a substantial fraction of S0s present in the core region arrive via secondary infall. We also find evidence in the SSFR profiles that star formation in S0s begins to decline beyond the virialized core, likely due to preprocessing in infalling groups. Our results support a delayed-then-rapid quenching scenario for SF S0s in cluster regions, where their centrally concentrated star formation persists for an extended period before abruptly ending ($\lesssim 0.1$ Gyr) after their first pericenter passage.</description>

      <title>Dust-obscured Galaxies with Broken Power-law Spectral Energy Distributions Discovered by UNIONS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of infrared-bright dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with $(i - [22])_{\rm AB} \geq 7.0$. Using photometry from the deep and wide Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey, combined with near-IR and mid-IR data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we successfully identified 382 DOGs in $\sim$ 170 deg$^2$. Among them, the vast majority (376 DOGs) were classified into two subclasses: bump DOGs (132/376) and power-law (PL) DOGs (244/376), which are dominated by star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN), respectively. Through the SED analysis, we found that roughly half (120/244) of the PL DOGs show ``broken'' power-law SEDs. The significant red slope from optical to near-IR in the SEDs of these ``broken power-law DOGs'' (BPL DOGs) probably reflects their large amount of dust extinction. In other words, BPL DOGs are more heavily obscured AGNs, compared to PL DOGs with non-broken power-law SEDs.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas in cool-core brightest cluster galaxies at $z\simeq0.4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) are today passive and very massive galaxies at the center of their clusters, still accreting mass through swallowing companions, and flows of cold gas, regulated by radio-mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. However, their formation history is still a matter of debate. We report new results based on millimeter observations performed with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer, mapping the cold molecular gas (CO) that feeds the star formation of distant BCGs. We selected three among the strongest cool-core BCGs at intermediate redshifts ($z\simeq0.4$), namely RX 1532, MACS 1447, and CHIPS 1911. Previous unresolved millimeter observations and multi-wavelength analysis showed that they are among the most star forming (${\rm SFR}\simeq100~ M_\odot/{\rm yr}$) and gas rich ($M_{H_2}\simeq10^{11}~M_\odot$) BCGs at intermediate redshifts. The selected BCGs are thus caught in a phase of rapid mass assembly, which makes them ideal targets for high-resolution observations of their molecular gas. By combining NOEMA intensity and velocity maps with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope, we detect in-situ star formation, filaments of accreting cold gas likely regulated by AGN feedback, disturbed morphology associated with tidal tails of molecular gas, as well as gas compression and tails originated from stripping of gas. While effective condensation of the intra-cluster medium is required to explain the large molecular gas reservoirs, the BCGs exhibit a broad variety of environment-driven mechanisms responsible for the processing of their cold gas: flows of cooling gas (RX 1532), ram pressure or sloshing of the intra-cluster medium (MACS 1447), and galactic tides (CHIPS 1911). This study thus sheds new insights on the physical mechanisms responsible for the mass assembly of galaxies hosting AGN at the center of clusters.</description>

Abstract: We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) which we confirm to be a $z=9.288$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN). First identified as a high-redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS-LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad $3500$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\beta$ emission line and narrow [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on the broad H$\beta$ line, we compute a canonical black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})=7.58\pm0.15$, although full consideration of systematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of $6.65&lt;\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})&lt;8.50$. These observations suggest that either a massive black hole seed, or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing periods of super-Eddington accretion, is necessary to grow such a massive black hole in $\lesssim500$ Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS-LRD-z9 exhibits a strong Balmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ($\sim 10^{10}\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using CLOUDY to fit the emission red-ward of the Balmer break with a dense gas-enshrouded AGN, and bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar population. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy ($&lt;10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$) implies that the black-hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly $&gt;5\%$ (although systematic uncertainties on the black-hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV continuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating that this UV emission may also be of AGN origin, and hence the true stellar mass of the host may be still lower.</description>

      <title>Insights into the 3D layered structure of nearby open clusters through N-body simulations</title>

Abstract: Context. Open clusters (OCs) are important for understanding star formation, dynamics, and evolution. Previous studies have indicated a relationship between cluster structure and member star properties, but the formation mechanism of the layered structure of OCs remains unclear. Aims. We study the three-dimensional spatial distribution of 279 nearby OCs to understand the formation mechanism of the layered structure. Methods. We analyzed the spatial distribution of member stars within each OC and correlated the presence of a layered structure with the number of member stars. Additionally, we performd N-body simulations to model the evolution of OCSN 125. We assessd the correlation between the binary fraction, the most massive star, and the radius of the layered structure in each simulated OC. Results. Our analysis reveals that OCs with fewer member stars tend to lack a layered structure. The results from N-body simulations indicate that the presence of a layered structure is strongly influenced by dynamical factors, particularly the most massive star and the binary fraction. Massive stars drive mass loss through supernova explosions and stellar winds, which weaken the spatial layering. Furthermore, clusters with higher binary fractions exhibit a weaker layered structure, likely due to energy equipartition, dynamical friction, and perturbations caused by binary systems. These factors contribute to delaying core collapse and slowing the emergence of a layered structure. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that dynamical interactions, including the effects of the most massive stars and binary fraction, play a critical role in the formation and disruption of the layered structure in OCs.</description>

      <title>Precise Cosmological Constraints from BOSS Galaxy Clustering with a Simulation-Based Emulator of the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a reanalysis of the BOSS CMASS DR12 galaxy dataset using a simulation-based emulator for the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) coefficients. Moving beyond our previous works, which laid the foundation for the first galaxy clustering application of this estimator, we construct a neural net-based emulator for the cosmological dependence of the WST coefficients and the 2-point correlation function multipoles, trained from the state-of-the-art suite of \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulations combined with a flexible Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) galaxy model. In order to confirm the accuracy of our pipeline, we subject it to a series of thorough internal and external mock parameter recovery tests, before applying it to reanalyze the CMASS observations in the redshift range $0.46&lt;z&lt;0.57$. We find that a joint WST + 2-point correlation function likelihood analysis allows us to obtain marginalized 1$\sigma$ errors on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters that are tighter by a factor of $2.5-6$, compared to the 2-point correlation function, and by a factor of $1.4-2.5$ compared to the WST-only results. This corresponds to a competitive $0.9\%$, $2.3\%$ and $1\%$ level of determination for parameters $\omega_c$, $\sigma_8$ $\&amp;$ $n_s$, respectively, and also to a $0.7\%$ $\&amp;$ $2.5 \%$ constraint on derived parameters h and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, in agreement with the \textit{Planck} 2018 results. Our results reaffirm the constraining power of the WST and highlight the exciting prospect of employing higher-order statistics in order to fully exploit the power of upcoming Stage-IV spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Cascade V4: A Semi-Analytical Code for Modeling Cosmological Gamma-Ray Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing Monte Carlo electromagnetic transport models, finding good agreement within EBL uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Elliptical multipoles for gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing galaxies are commonly modeled with elliptical density profiles, to which angular complexity is sometimes added through a multipole expansion - encoding deformations of the elliptical iso-density contours. The formalism that is widely used in current studies and software packages, however, employs perturbations that are defined with respect to a circle. In this work, we show that this popular formulation (the "circular multipoles") leads to perturbation patterns that depend on the axis ratio and do not agree with physical expectations (from studies of galaxy isophotal shapes) when applied to profiles that are not near-circular. We propose a more appropriate formulation, the "elliptical multipoles", representing deviations from ellipticity suited for any axis ratio. We solve for the lensing potentials associated with the $m=1$ circular multipole (previously undetermined in the isothermal case), as well as the elliptical multipoles of any order $m$, assuming that the reference profile is near-isothermal. We implement these solutions into the lens modeling package $\mathtt{lenstronomy}$, and assess the importance of the multipole formulation by comparing flux-ratio perturbations in mock lensed systems with quadruply imaged quasars: we show that elliptical multipoles typically produce smaller flux-ratio perturbations than their circular counterparts.</description>

      <title>Identifying intermediate mass binary black hole mergers in AGN disks using LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna can uniquely identify the sites of intermediate-mass binary black hole (IMBBH) mergers if they occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks with a gas density $\rho\geq10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$ via measurement of dynamical friction effect in the gravitational waveform. We find that even a single observation of a gravitational wave source with a total mass of $10^3 M_{\odot}$ and a mass ratio of 2 at a luminosity distance of 3 Gpc is sufficient to confidently associate the merger to be in an AGN disk with a density $\sim 10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$, as it allows estimation of the density with an error bar $O(100\%)$. This provides a new way of inferring AGN disk densities that complement traditional X-ray observations. Further, we find that neglecting the presence of environmental effects in the waveform models used for parameter estimation can bias the chirp mass, mass ratio and arrival time of a merger. If not corrected, this can significantly impact our ability to carry out multiband data analysis of IMBBHs that combines information from LISA and ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST. We find that a transition from a Salpeter population to top-heavy Pop-III stars is likely at $z\simeq10$ and that beyond $z=10-15$ the feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei is progressively reduced, so that at $z\simeq25$ the production of stars is almost free from any feedback. We compare fuzzy and warm DM models that suppress small-scale structures with the CDM paradigm, finding that the fuzzy DM mass $&gt; 4.5 \times 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$ and the warm DM mass $&gt; 1.5\, {\rm keV}$ at the 95\% CL. The fits of the star formation rate parametrization do not depend strongly on the DM properties within the allowed range. We find no preference over CDM for enhanced matter perturbations associated with axion miniclusters or primordial black holes. The scale of the enhancement of the power spectrum should be $&gt; 27\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at the 95\% CL, excluding axion miniclusters produced for $m_a &lt; 7.5 \times 10^{-17}\,{\rm eV}$ or heavy primordial black holes that constitute a fraction $f_{\rm PBH} &gt; {\rm Max}[88 M_{\odot}/m_{\rm PBH}, 10^{-4} (m_{\rm PBH}/10^4 M_{\odot})^{-0.09}]$ of DM.</description>
