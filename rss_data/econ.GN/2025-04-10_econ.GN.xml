      <title>Blameocracy: Causal Attribution in Political Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a supervised method to detect causal attribution in political texts, distinguishing between expressions of merit and blame. Analyzing four million tweets shared by U.S. Congress members from 2012 to 2023, we document a pronounced shift toward causal attribution following the 2016 presidential election. The shift reflects changes in rhetorical strategy rather than compositional variation in the actors or topics of the political debate. Within causal communication, a trade-off emerges between positive and negative tone, with power status as the key determinant: government emphasizes merit, while opposition casts blame. This pattern distinguishes causal from purely affective communication. Additionally, we find that blame is associated with lower trust in politicians, perceived government effectiveness, and spreads more virally than merit.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Grading and Classification System for End-of-Life Building Components Toward Circular Economy Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longevity and viability of construction components in a circular economy demand a robust, data-informed framework for reuse decision-making. This paper introduces a multi-level grading and classification system that combines Bayesian probabilistic modeling with scenario-based performance thresholds to assess the reusability of end-of-life modular components. By grading components across a five-tier scale, the system supports strategic decisions for reuse, up-use, or down-use, ensuring alignment with engineering standards and sustainability objectives. The model's development is grounded in empirical data from precast concrete wall panels, and its explainability is enhanced through decision tree logic and Sankey visualizations that trace the influence of contextual scenarios on classification outcomes. MGCS addresses the environmental, economic, and operational challenges of EoL management--reducing material waste, optimizing value recovery, and improving workflow efficiency. Through dynamic feature weighting and transparent reasoning, the system offers a practical yet rigorous pathway to embed circular thinking into construction industry practices.</description>

      <title>The Policy Paradox: Government Debt Servicing and Local Bank Risk Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13423</link>

Abstract: The issue of local government debt is widely recognized as one of the "gray rhinos" affecting the stable development of China's economy. Government debt can transmit risks to local banks, which are among the primary holders of local debt, thereby triggering systemic financial risks. Consequently, exploring debt resolution pathways and evaluating the systematic effects of debt servicing policies has become critically important. This study employs panel data from 348 local commercial banks across 29 provincial-level administrative regions in China from 2010 to 2023, and constructs a difference-in-differences (DID) model to investigate the impact of the State Council's special supervision of debt servicing on local bank risks. The findings indicate that the government's debt servicing policy essentially represents a shift of government debt from explicit to implicit forms, significantly increasing the risks faced by local banks and producing outcomes contrary to the policy's original intent. This effect is particularly pronounced for rural commercial banks and banks with high customer concentration and fewer branches. Mechanism analysis reveals two key insights. First, local banks are heavily influenced by local government control; the government's debt servicing requires banks to support the government by purchasing government bonds and other financial instruments, which leads to a deterioration in asset quality and an expansion of risk exposure. Second, government debt crowds out private credit from local banks, weakening the region's repayment capacity and ultimately increasing bank risk. Our research uncovers the counterintuitive effects of government debt servicing and offers corresponding policy recommendations.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Human-AI Teaming: A Review and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing at an unprecedented pace, with clear potential to enhance decision-making and productivity. Yet, the collaborative decision-making process between humans and AI remains underdeveloped, often falling short of its transformative possibilities. This paper explores the evolution of AI agents from passive tools to active collaborators in human-AI teams, emphasizing their ability to learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. This paradigm shifts challenges traditional team dynamics, requiring new interaction protocols, delegation strategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. Drawing on Team Situation Awareness (SA) theory, we identify two critical gaps in current human-AI teaming research: the difficulty of aligning AI agents with human values and objectives, and the underutilization of AI's capabilities as genuine team members. Addressing these gaps, we propose a structured research outlook centered on four key aspects of human-AI teaming: formulation, coordination, maintenance, and training. Our framework highlights the importance of shared mental models, trust-building, conflict resolution, and skill adaptation for effective teaming. Furthermore, we discuss the unique challenges posed by varying team compositions, goals, and complexities. This paper provides a foundational agenda for future research and practical design of sustainable, high-performing human-AI teams.</description>
