      <title>Asymmetric vertical transport in weakly forced shallow flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an investigation of the vertical transport of tracer particles released within a shallow, continuously-forced flow by means of numerical simulations. The investigation is motivated by the shallow flows encountered in many environmental situations and inspired by the laboratory experiments conducted in electromagnetically forced shallow fluid layers. The flow is confined to a thin fluid layer by stress-free top and no-slip bottom walls. The dynamics and the transport properties of the shallow flow are investigated under various flow conditions characterized by a Reynolds number related to the forcing, $Re_F$, and the aspect ratio of vertical and horizontal length scales $\delta$. The simulated shallow flows exhibit distinctive spatial distributions of vertical velocities: broader, weaker upwellings surrounded by narrower, stronger downwellings. These vertical flows are related to the horizontal flow structures, with updrafts occurring where the horizontal flow is vorticity-dominated, and the downdrafts where it is strain-dominated. The magnitude of the asymmetry in strength and size of the vertical flows and their correlation with horizontal structures depends on the flow conditions and significantly influences the vertical spreading of particles within the fluid volume. Under conditions leading to a large asymmetry, particles within updrafts are transported slowly upwards, while particles within downdrafts rapidly move downwards. In addition, particles are trapped for longer within the updrafts than downdrafts because of their correlation with vorticity-dominated regions. However, when the flow becomes fully three-dimensional and highly unsteady, this transport asymmetry subsides because the updrafts and downdrafts exhibit similar strength and size in such flow conditions. Consequently, similar amounts of particles are transported upwards and downwards at similar rates.</description>

      <title>Laminar planar jets of elastoviscoplastic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform numerical simulations of planar jets of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluid (\citet{saramito2007new} model) at low Reynolds number. Three different configurations are considered: $(i)$ EVP jet in EVP ambient fluid, $(ii)$ EVP jet in Newtonian ambient fluid (miscible), and $(iii)$ EVP jet in Newtonian ambient fluid (immiscible). We investigate the effect of the Bingham number, \textit{i.e.} of the dimensionless yield stress of the EVP fluid, on the jet dynamics, and find a good agreement with the scaling for laminar, Newtonian jets for the centerline velocity $u_c/u_0\propto (x/h)^{-1/3}$ and for the jet thickness $\delta_{mom}/h\propto (x/h)^{2/3}$ at small Bingham number. This is lost once substantial regions of the fluid become unyielded, where we find that the spreading rate of the jet and the decay rate of the centerline velocity increase with the Bingham number, due to the regions of unyielded fluid inducing a blockage effect on the jet. The most striking difference among the three configurations we considered is the extent and position of the regions of unyielded fluid: large portions of ambient and jet fluids (in particular, away from the inlet) are unyielded for the EVP jet in EVP ambient fluid, whereas for the other two configurations, the regions of unyielded fluid are limited to the jet, as expected. We derive a power law scaling for the centerline yield variable and confirm it with the results from our numerical simulations. The yield variable determines the transition from the viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid (yielded) to the viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt material (unyielded).</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Particle Tracking at Large Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle tracking in turbulent flows is fundamental to the study of the transport of tracers, inertial particles or even active objects in space and time, i.e. the Lagrangian frame of reference. It provides experimental tests of theoretical predictions (e.g. for the statistics of fluid accelerations and particle dispersion) and helps to understand important natural processes where particle inertia is important (e.g. cloud microphysics). While the spatial (Eulerian) properties of turbulent flows have been studied for high, atmospheric Reynolds numbers ($R_\lambda &gt; 10^4$), the profound difficulties in accurately tracking particles in turbulent flows have limited the Reynolds numbers in the Lagrangian reference frame to the Taylor scale Reynolds numbers $R_\lambda \lesssim 10^3$. Here we describe a setup that allowed Lagrangian particle tracking at $R_\lambda$ between 100 and 6000 in the Max Planck Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel (VDTT). We describe the imaging setup within the pressurised facility, the laser illumination, the particles and the particle dispersion mechanism. We verify that the KOBO Cellulobeads D-10 particles are suitable tracers. They carry negligible charge and their Stokes number is small over the full range of experimental conditions. We present typical data from the experiment and discuss the challenges and constraints of the setup.</description>

      <title>Particle chirality does not matter in strong turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence in a cubic domain to investigate the dynamics of heavy, chiral, finite-size inertial particles and their effects on the flow. Using an immersed-boundary method and a complex collision model, four-way coupled simulations have been performed and the effects of particle-to-fluid density ratio, turbulence strength, and particle volume fraction have been analysed. We find that freely falling particles on the one hand add energy to the turbulent flow but, on the other hand, they also enhance the flow dissipation: depending on the combination of flow parameters, the former or the latter mechanism prevails, thus yielding enhanced or weakened turbulence. Furthermore, particle chirality entails a preferential angular velocity which induces a net vorticity in the fluid phase. As turbulence strengthens, the energy introduced by the falling particles becomes less relevant and stronger velocity fluctuations alter the solid phase dynamics, making the effect of chirality irrelevant. Moreover, comparing the time-history of collision events for chiral particles and spheres (at the same volume fraction) suggests that the former tend to entangle, in contrast to the latter which rebound impulsively.</description>

      <title>Nonlocally coupled moisture model for convective self-aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clouds play a central role in climate physics by interacting with precipitation, radiation, and circulation. Although the self-aggregation of clouds is a fundamental problem in convective organization, a theoretical explanation of how it occurs has not been established owing to its complexity. Here, we introduce an idealized mathematical model of the phenomenon in which the state of the system is represented solely by the atmospheric columns' vertically integrated water vapor content. By analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of this simplified system, we mathematically elucidated the mechanisms that determine the onset of self-aggregation and the spatial scale of the self-aggregated state. Nonlocal coupling between atmospheric columns makes the system bistable with dry and moist equilibria, reflecting the effect of circulation driven by horizontal differential heating due to convection and radiation. The bistable self-aggregated state is realized when destabilization by nonlocal coupling triggered by finite-amplitude disturbances in the uniform state overwhelms the stabilization by diffusion. For globally coupled systems in which all the columns are equally coupled, the perturbation of the maximum wavelength has the maximum growth rate. A solution with an infinitely long wavelength exists, which can be understood as the dynamical system's heteroclinic trajectories describing the steady state's spatial evolution. In contrast, for nonlocally coupled systems with finite filter lengths, perturbation of the wavelength close to the characteristic length of the coupling is preferred. The results revealed that the balance between nonlocal coupling and diffusion is essential for understanding convective self-aggregation.</description>

      <title>Modelling large mass removal in adsorption columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mathematical model is developed to describe column adsorption when the contaminant constitutes a significant amount of the fluid. This requires modelling the variation of pressure and velocity, in addition to the usual advection-diffusion-adsorption and kinetic equations describing concentration and adsorption rates. The model builds on previous work based on a linear kinetic equation, to include both physical and chemical adsorption. A semi-analytical solution is developed and validated against a numerical solution. The model is tested against experimental data for the adsorption of large quantities of CO$_2$ from a helium mixture, with a CO$_2$ volume fraction ranging from 14% to 69%, and a N$_2$ mixture with 16% to 33% CO$_2$ volume fraction. Our results show a significant improvement with respect to models for the removal of trace amounts of contaminant.</description>
