      <title>Magnetoroton in a two-dimensional Bose-Bose mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our theory of slow magnons in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate to the case of two spatial dimensions (2D). We provide a detailed discussion of polaronic corrections to the magnon branch of the elementary excitation spectrum in a weakly- and strongly-interacting regimes. In a dilute system, the latter may be achieved by adjusting inter-species attraction such as to obtain a resonance in the $p$-wave scattering channel. Resonantly enhanced $p$-wave attraction results in the self-localization of magnons and formation of a magnetoroton. The nature of a ground state beyond the magnetoroton instability remains to be explored. We suggest a dilute p-wave crystal of alternating polarization as a possible candidate. In contrast to three dimensions (3D), the required strength of the attractive potential in the $s$-wave channel here corresponds to tight binding, and we suggest a potential realization of our model with excitons in 2D semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Cooling dynamics of a free ion in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an ion moving through a homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) after an initial momentum is imparted. For this, we derive a master equation in the weak-coupling limit and Lamb-Dicke approximation for the reduced density matrix of the ion. We study the time evolution of the ion's kinetic energy and observe that its expectation value, identified as the ion temperature $T_\mathrm{ion}$, is reduced by several orders of magnitude in a time on the order of microseconds for a condensate density in the experimentally relevant range between $10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. We characterize this behavior by defining the duration at half maximum as the time required by $T_\mathrm{ion}$ to reach half of its initial value, and study its dependence on the system parameters. Similarly, we find that the expectation value of the ion's momentum operator is reduced by nine orders of magnitude on the same timescale, making the ion's position converge to a final value. Based on these results, we conclude that the interaction with the bosonic bath allows for cooling and pinning of the ion by decreasing the expectation value of its kinetic energy and velocity, which constitutes a result of direct relevance for current atom-ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal melting of a vortex lattice in a quasi two-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of the melting of a vortex lattice in a fast rotating quasi-two dimensional Bose gas, under the influence of thermal fluctuations. We image the vortex lattice after a time-of-flight expansion, for increasing rotation frequency at constant atom number and temperature. We detect the vortex positions and study the order of the lattice using the pair correlation function and the orientational correlation function. We evidence the melting transition by an abrupt change in the decay of orientational correlations, associated to a proliferation of dislocations. Our findings are consistent with the hexatic to liquid transition in the KTHNY scenario for two-dimensional melting.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of interacting bosons: generalized coherent states versus multi-mode Glauber states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-mode Glauber coherent states (MMGS) as well as Bloch states with zero quasi-momentum, which are a special case of generalized coherent states (GCS), are frequently used to describe condensed phases of bosonic many-body systems. The difference of two-point correlators of MMGS and GCS vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Using the established expansion of GCS in terms of MMGS, we derive a Fourier-type relation between the (auto-)correlation functions of the two different time-evolved states. This relation reveals that the (auto-)correlation and thus the dynamical free energy density for the two cases are still different, even in the thermodynamic limit, due to the lack of the U(1) symmetry of the MMGS. Analytic results for the deep lattice model of interacting bosons for increasing filling factors show multiple sharp structures in the dynamical free energy-density of increasing complexity. These are explained using the evolution of Husimi functions in phase space.</description>

      <title>Dynamical excitation control and multimode emission of an atom-photon bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom-photon bound states arise from the coupling of quantum emitters to the band edge of dispersion-engineered waveguides. Thanks to their tunable-range interactions, they are promising building blocks for quantum simulators. Here, we study the dynamics of an atom-photon bound state emerging from coupling a frequency-tunable quantum emitter - a transmon-type superconducting circuit - to the band edge of a microwave metamaterial. Employing precise temporal control over the frequency detuning of the emitter from the band edge, we examine the transition from adiabatic to non-adiabatic behavior in the formation of the bound state and its melting into the propagating modes of the metamaterial. Moreover, we experimentally observe multi-mode emission from the bound state, triggered by a fast change of the emitter's frequency. Our study offers insight into the dynamic preparation of atom-photon bound states and provides a method to characterize their photonic content, with implications in quantum optics and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Overview of projective quantum measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of standard "projective" quantum measurements with the goal of elucidating connections between theory and experiment. We make use of a unitary "Stinespring" representation of measurements on a dilated Hilbert space that includes both the physical degrees of freedom and those of the measurement apparatus. We explain how this unitary representation (i) is guaranteed by the axioms of quantum mechanics, (ii) relates to both the Kraus and von Neumann representations, and (iii) corresponds to the physical time evolution of the system and apparatus during the measurement process. The Stinespring representation also offers significant conceptual insight into measurements, helps connects theory and experiment, is particularly useful in describing protocols involving midcircuit measurements and outcome-dependent operations, and establishes that all quantum operations are compatible with relativistic locality, among other insights.</description>

      <title>In-situ Imaging of a Single-Atom Wave Packet in Continuous Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wave nature of matter remains one of the most striking aspects of quantum mechanics. Since its inception, a wealth of experiments has demonstrated the interference, diffraction or scattering of massive particles. More recently, experiments with ever increasing control and resolution have allowed imaging the wavefunction of individual atoms. Here, we use quantum gas microscopy to image the in-situ spatial distribution of deterministically prepared single-atom wave packets as they expand in a plane. We achieve this by controllably projecting the expanding wavefunction onto the sites of a deep optical lattice and subsequently performing single-atom imaging. The protocol established here for imaging extended wave packets via quantum gas microscopy is readily applicable to the wavefunction of interacting many-body systems in continuous space, promising a direct access to their microscopic properties, including spatial correlation functions up to high order and large distances.</description>

      <title>One dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate under the effect of the extended uncertainty principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, an analytical investigation was conducted to assess the effects of the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) on a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) described by the deformed one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). Analytical solutions were derived for null potential while we used variational and numerical methods for a harmonic oscillator potential. The effects of EUP on stability, probability density, position, and momentum uncertainties of BEC are analyzed. The EUP is found to be applicable for the free dark soliton solution and in the presence of a harmonic potential within specific ranges of the deformation parameter $\alpha$, while it is not valid for the free bright soliton solution.</description>

      <title>Probing pair correlations in Fermi gases with Ramsey-Bragg interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an interferometric method to probe pair correlations in a gas of spin-1/2 fermions. The method consists of a Ramsey sequence where both spin states of the Fermi gas are set in a superposition of a state at rest and a state with a large recoil velocity. The two-body density matrix is extracted via the fluctuations of the transferred fraction to the recoiled state. In the pair-condensed phase, the off-diagonal long-range order is directly reflected in the asymptotic behavior of the interferometric signal for long interrogation times. The method also allows to probe the spatial structure of the condensed pairs: the interferometric signal is an oscillating function of the interrogation time in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime; it becomes an overdamped function in the molecular Bose-Einstein condensate regime.</description>
