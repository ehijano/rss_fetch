      <title>Enhanced strange metallicity from Coulomb repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a model of electrons with Hubbard-$U$ Coulomb repulsion and a random Yukawa coupling to a two-dimensional bosonic bath, using an extended dynamical mean field theory scheme. Our model exhibits a quantum critical point, at which the repulsive component of the electron interactions strongly enhances the effects of the quantum critical bosonic fluctuations on the electrons, leading to a breakdown of Fermi liquid physics and the formation of a strange metal with `Planckian' ($\mathcal{O}(k_B T/\hbar)$) quasiparticle decay rates at low temperatures $T\rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, the eventual Mott transition that occurs as the repulsion is increased seemingly bounds the maximum decay rate in the strange metal. Our results provide insight into low-temperature strange metallicity observed in proximity to a Mott transition, as is observed, for instance, in recent experiments on certain moir\'{e} materials.</description>

      <title>Projected Entangled Pair States with flexible geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are a class of quantum many-body states that generalize Matrix Product States for one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions. In recent years, PEPS have advanced understanding of strongly correlated systems, especially in two dimensions, e.g., quantum spin liquids. Typically described by tensor networks on regular lattices (e.g., square, cubic), PEPS have also been adapted for irregular graphs, however, the computational cost becomes prohibitive for dense graphs with large vertex degrees. In this paper, we present a PEPS algorithm to simulate low-energy states and dynamics defined on arbitrary, fluctuating, and densely connected graphs. We introduce a cut-off, $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$, to constrain the vertex degree of the PEPS to a set but tunable value, which is enforced in the optimization by applying a simple edge-deletion rule, allowing the geometry of the PEPS to change and adapt dynamically to the system's correlation structure. We benchmark our flexible PEPS algorithm with simulations of classical spin glasses and quantum annealing on densely connected graphs with hundreds of spins, and also study the impact of tuning $\kappa$ when simulating a uniform quantum spin model on a regular (square) lattice. Our work opens the way to apply tensor network algorithms to arbitrary, even fluctuating, background geometries.</description>

      <title>Structurally triggered orbital and charge orderings in TlMnO$_3$ and related compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal insulator transition with C-type orbital ordering (OO) is generic among RMn$^{3+}$O$_3$(R=rare earth) perovskites with a $Pbnm$ ground state. Distinctly, TlMnO$_3$ shows a very different rocksalt (G-type) OO together with the emergence of an unusual triclinic $P\overline{1}$ structure. Employing first principles calculations, and symmetry mode analysis we investigated structural and electronic origin of G-type OO in TlMnO$_3$. We reveal that Jahn-Teller (JT) distortion in TlMnO$_3$ is structurally triggered, consequently giving rise to G type OO. Similar mechanism is rather common in RNi$^{3+}$O$_3$ perovskites, where breathing of NiO$_6$ is observed. We further reveal that, triggering of breathing distortion is not limited to nickelates but also present in TlMnO$_3$ (and LaMnO$_3$). In fact, other types of JT distortion, are also show triggering mechanism, although final ground state of these systems result from subtle anharmonic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of two-dimensional ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, the van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures constructed by ferroelectric and ferromagnetic monolayers have soon become the ideal platforms to achieve converse magnetoelectric functions at the nanoscale, namely to use electric field to control magnetization. In this Letter, by employing density functional theory calculations and dynamic simulations of atomic spin model, we study the key role of interfacial Dzyaloshinshii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in CrI$_3$-In$_2$Se$_3$ vdW heterostructures. Our work demonstrates feasible DMI torques pumped by ferroelectric switching, which can drive current-free and low-energy consumption domain wall motion. Moreover, such interfacial DMI can also significantly enlarge the Walker field in magnetic field-driven domain wall technique.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced nonmonotonic evolution of superconductivity in 6R-TaS2 with a natural bulk van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural bulk van der Waals heterostructures compound 6R-TaS2 consists of alternate stacking 1T- and 1H-TaS2 monolayers, creating a unique system that incorporates charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity (SC) in distinct monolayers. Here, after confirming that the 2D nature of the lattice is preserved up to 8 GPa in 6R-TaS2, we documented an unusual evolution of CDW and SC by conducting highpressure electronic transport measurements. Upon compression, we observe a gradual suppression of CDW within the 1T-layers, while the SC exhibits a dome-shaped behavior that terminates at a critical pressure Pc around 2.9 GPa. By taking account of the fact that the substantial suppression of SC is concomitant with the complete collapse of CDW order at Pc, we argue that the 6R-TaS2 behaves like a stack of Josephson junctions and thus the suppressed superconductivity can be attributed to the weakening of Josephson coupling associated with the presence of CDW fluctuations in the 1T-layers. Furthermore, the SC reversely enhances above Pc, implying the development of emergent superconductivity in the 1T-layers after the melting of T-layer CDW orders. These results show that the 6R-TaS2 not only provides a promising platform to explore emergent phenomena but also serves as a model system to study the complex interactions between competing electronic states.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the possibility of high $T_c$ s$\pm$-wave superconductivity in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Interpretable correlator Transformer for image-like quantum matter data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their inherent capabilities of capturing non-local dependencies, Transformer neural networks have quickly been established as the paradigmatic architecture for large language models and image processing. Next to these traditional applications, machine learning methods have also been demonstrated to be versatile tools in the analysis of image-like data of quantum phases of matter, e.g. given snapshots of many-body wave functions obtained in ultracold atom experiments. While local correlation structures in image-like data of physical systems can reliably be detected, identifying phases of matter characterized by global, non-local structures with interpretable machine learning methods remains a challenge. Here, we introduce the correlator Transformer (CoTra), which classifies different phases of matter while at the same time yielding full interpretability in terms of physical correlation functions. The network's underlying structure is a tailored attention mechanism, which learns efficient ways to weigh local and non-local correlations for a successful classification. We demonstrate the versatility of the CoTra by detecting local order in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, and show that local gauge constraints in one- and two-dimensional lattice gauge theories can be identified. Furthermore, we establish that the CoTra reliably detects non-local structures in images of correlated fermions in momentum space (Cooper pairs) and that it can distinguish percolating from non-percolating images.</description>

      <title>Slow decay rate of correlations induced by long-range extended Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of long-range Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in the extended XY model on the phase diagram as well as the static and dynamical properties of quantum and classical correlation functions. It is known that in the nearest-neighbor XY model with DM interaction, the transition from the gapless chiral phase to a gapped one occurs when the strengths of the DM interaction and anisotropy coincide. We exhibit that the critical line gets modified with the range of interactions which decay according to power-law. Specifically, instead of being gapless in the presence of a strong DM interaction, a gapped region emerges which grows with the increase of the moderate fall-off rate (quasi-long range regime) in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The gapless chiral phase can also be separated from a gapped one by the decay patterns of quantum mutual information and classical correlation with distant sites of the ground state which are independent of the fall-off rate in the gapless zone. We observe that the corresponding critical lines that depend on the fall-off rate can also be determined from the effective central charge involved in the scaling of entanglement entropy. We illustrate that in a non-equilibrium setting, the relaxation dynamics of classical correlation, the decay rate of total correlation, and the growth rate of entanglement entropy can be employed to uncover whether the evolving Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian corresponding to the initial state are gapped or gapless.</description>

      <title>Ge-based Clinopyroxene series: first principles and experimental local probe study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural and electronic properties of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ clinopyroxene systems have been investigated by means of perturbed angular correlation (PAC) measurements, performed at ISOLDE, combined with $ab-initio$ electronic structure calculations within the density functional theory (DFT) framework. The partial density of states (PDOS) of the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$ stable compounds has been determined, and it has been observed that the requirement of including an on-site Hubbard-$U$ potential was necessary in order to describe the highly correlated Mn $3d$-states. By considering $U_{eff}$=4 eV, we obtained a band gap width of 1.82 eV and 1.70 eV, for the CaMnGe$_2$O$_6$ and SrMnGe$_2$O$_6$, respectively. Combining electric field gradient (EFG) first principles calculations, using a supercell scheme, with experimental PAC results, we were able to infer that the Cd probe can replace either the $A$ (Ca, Sr) or the Mn sites in the crystalline structures. We also showed that Cd substitution is expected to lead to a reduction in the width of the band gap in these systems, evidencing opportunities for potential band-gap engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fibonacci topological order is the prime candidate for the realization of universal topological quantum computation. We devise minimal quantum circuits to demonstrate the non-Abelian nature of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, as realized in the Levin-Wen string net model. Our circuits effectively initialize the ground state, create excitations, twist and braid them, all in the smallest lattices possible. We further design methods to determine the fusion amplitudes and braiding phases of multiple excitations by carrying out a single qubit measurement. We show that the fusion channels of the doubled Fibonacci model can be detected using only three qubits, twisting phases can be measured using five, and braiding can be demonstrated using nine qubits. These designs provide the simplest possible settings for demonstrating the properties of Fibonacci anyons and can be used as realistic blueprints for implementation on many modern quantum architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin pumping effect is a sensitive and well-established experimental method in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials. We propose that spin pumping effect can be a valuable probe for non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviors at the 2D interface of magnetic heterostructures. We show that the modulations of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) exhibiting power-law scalings in frequency and temperature for NFL metals induced near a quantum critical point (QCP). The exponents are universal parameters inherited from the QCP and reflect the non-quasiparticle nature of spin relaxation in NFLs. We demonstrate the divergent FMR modulations with a particular focus on the Ising nematic QCP at both zero and finite temperatures, which contradicts the conventional Gilbert damping mechanism in normal Fermi liquids. Our theoretical proposal could potentially catalyze a surge in research harnessing insights from spin-dependent non-equilibrium physics at nanoscale, primarily developed for room-temperature functioning spin devices in the rapidly progressing field of spintronics, to access magnetic properties in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental progress in the quasi-one-dimensional quantum magnet NiNb$_2$O$_6$, we study the spin dynamics of an S=1 ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with single-ion anisotropy by using a semiclassical molecular dynamics approach. This system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a ferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state under a transverse magnetic field, and the magnetic responses reflecting this transition is well described by our semiclassical method. We show that at low-temperature the transverse component of the dynamical structure factor depicts clearly the magnon dispersion, and the longitudinal component exhibits two continua associated with single- and two-magnon excitations, respectively. These spin excitation spectra show interesting temperature dependence as effects of magnon interactions.Our findings shed light on experimental detection of spin excitations in a large class of quasi-one-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum scaling of the spin lattice relaxation rate in the checkerboard $J$-$Q$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress on the experimental realization of proximate deconfined quantum critical point in a frustrated quantum magnet, we study the low-energy spin dynamics of a related checkerboard $J$-$Q$ model by using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The ground state of this model undergoes a weakly first-order quantum phase transition with an emergent $O(4)$ symmetry between an antiferromagnetic state and a plaquette valence bond solid. The calculated spin lattice relaxation rate of nuclear magnetic resonance, $1/T_1$, exhibits distinct low-temperature behaviors depending on the ground states. With decreasing the temperature, $1/T_1$ rises up on the antiferromagnetic side, characterizing a crossover to the renormalized classical regime, whereas $1/T_1$ drops exponentially on the side of valence bond solid, reflecting the gap opening in the plaquette ordered phase. The extracted spin gap scales with the distance to the transition point as a power-law with an exponent $\phi\approx0.3$, consistent with the scaling ansatz $\phi=\nu z$ with $\nu\approx0.3$ and $z=1$. Near the quantum phase transition, the temperature dependent $1/T_1$ shows a broad crossover regime where a universal scaling $1/T_1\sim T^{\eta}$ with $\eta\approx0.6$ is found. Our results suggest a quantum scaling regime associated with the emergent enhanced symmetry near this first-order quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Anomalous electronic energy relaxation and soft phonons in the Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have used a combination of linear response time-domain THz spectroscopy (TDTS) and high-field non-linear THz spectroscopy to separately probe the electronic momentum and energy relaxation rates respectively of the Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$. We find, consistent with prior measurements, that Cd$_3$As$_2$ has an enormous nonlinearities in the THz frequency range. We extract the momentum relaxation rate of Cd$_3$As$_2$ using Drude fits to the optical conductivity. We also conduct THz range 2D coherent spectroscopy. The dominant response is a pump-probe signal, which allow us to separately extract the energy relaxation rate. We find that the rate of energy relaxation decreases down to the lowest measured temperatures. We connect this to Cd$_3$As$_2$ anomalous lattice dynamics, evidence for which is found in its low thermal conductivity and soft phonons in Raman scattering. The lack of a peak in the energy relaxation rate as a function of T can be connected to the linear in T dependence of the current relaxation e.g. the phonon scattering is elastic down to the lowest measured temperatures approximately 120 K.</description>

Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points are exotic transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm. They are associated to a one-point gap closing between distinct locally ordered phases, thus to a continuous phase transition. Because of this intrinsic criticality, at deconfined quantum critical points algebraic decay of all the correlation functions is expected. Here, we show that it is possible to go beyond this assumption. Specifically, we consider one dimensional interacting fermions where the phenomenon of spin-charge separation arises. We first explore the low energy regimes where a sine-Gordon Hamiltonian can provide accurate results. By means of a field theory approach we find that continuous phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can occur. As a consequence of the decoupled spin and charge degrees of freedom, we find that in two cases only one gap vanishes while the other remains finite. We then derive a microscopic model where such phase transitions take place. By performing a numerical analysis, we unambiguously find that deconfined quantum critical points can indeed be further characterized by the long-range order of a parity operator signaling the presence of a finite gap. Our results provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Disorder in Quantum Magnets</title>

Abstract: There are no clean samples in nature. Therefore, when we come to discuss the entanglement properties of quantum materials, the effects of disorder must be taken into account. This question is of particular interest for high-entangled states, such as quantum spin liquids, which lie outside the Landau paradigm for classifying phases of matter. In this work, we explore what experimentally-accessible measures, in the form of concurrence, residual tangle and quantum Fisher information, can teach us about the entanglement in the presence of disorder. As a representative example, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) and disorder-driven random singlet (RS) states found in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. Using quantum Fisher information and residual tangle, we demonstrate that both TLL and RS states exhibit multi-partite entanglement. In the case of the RS state, we attribute this to entanglement localized below a crossover length scale. We further show that the order of disorder average matters in calculating measures like concurrence, and that this can lead to false inferences when interpreting experiment. None the less, correctly interpreted, these witnesses provide useful information about the effects of disorder. We explore how information about the central charge of the TLL can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of concurrence, and conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the effective central charge of the RS state. Finally, we establish how RS and TLL states can be distinguished through the growth of multi-partite entanglement, as witnessed by the equal-time structure factor. These results establish that, used carefully, experiments based on entanglement witnesses can provide important information about quantum spin systems in the presence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Competition between d-wave superconductivity and magnetism in uniaxially strained Sr2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pairing symmetry of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a long-standing fundamental question in the physics of superconducting materials with strong electronic correlations. We use the functional renormalization group to investigate the behavior of superconductivity under uniaxial strain in a two-dimensional realistic model of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ obtained with density functional theory and incorporating the effect of spin-orbit coupling. We find a dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconductor mostly hosted by the $d_{xy}$-orbital, with no other closely competing superconducting state. Within this framework we reproduce the experimentally observed enhancement of the critical temperature under strain and propose a simple mechanism driven by the density of states to explain our findings. We also investigate the competition between superconductivity and spin-density wave ordering as a function of interaction strength. By comparing theory and experiment, we discuss constraints on a possible degenerate partner of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Realizing Topological Superconductivity in Tunable Bose-Fermi Mixtures with Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as a promising platform for investigating exotic correlated states of matter. Here, we propose to engineer Bose-Fermi mixtures in these systems by coupling inter-layer excitons to doped charges in a trilayer structure. Their interactions are determined by the inter-layer trion, whose spin-selective nature allows excitons to mediate an attractive interaction between charge carriers of only one spin species. Remarkably, we find that this causes the system to become unstable to topological p+ip superconductivity at low temperatures. We then demonstrate a general mechanism to develop and control this unconventional state by tuning the trion binding energy using a solid-state Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Redundant string symmetry-based error correction: Demonstrations on quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational power in measurement-based quantum computing stems from the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order of entangled resource states. However, resource states are prone to preparation errors. We introduce a quantum error correction approach using redundant nonlocal symmetry of the resource state. We demonstrate it within a teleportation protocol based on extending the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of one-dimensional cluster states to other graph states. Qubit ZZ-crosstalk errors, which are prominent in quantum devices, degrade the teleportation fidelity of the usual cluster state. However, as we demonstrate on quantum hardware, once we grow graph states with redundant symmetry, perfect teleportation fidelity is restored. We identify the underlying redundant-SPT order as error-protected degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum.</description>

      <title>Magic Boundaries of 3D Color Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate boundaries of 3D color codes and provide a systematic classification into 101 distinct boundary types, including two novel classes. The first class consists of 1 boundary and is generated by sweeping the codimension-1 (2D) $T$-domain wall across the system and attaching it to the $X$-boundary that condenses only magnetic fluxes. Since the $T$-domain wall cannot condense on the $X$-boundary, a new magic boundary is produced, where the boundary stabilizers contain $XS$-stabilizers going beyond the conventional Pauli stabilizer formalism, and hence contains 'magic'. Neither electric nor magnetic excitations can condense on such a magic boundary, and only the composite of the magnetic flux and codimension-2 (1D) $S$-domain wall can condense on it, which makes the magic boundary going beyond the classification of the Lagrangian subgroup. The second class consists of 70 boundaries and is generated by sweeping the $S$-domain wall across a codimension-1 submanifold and attaching it to the boundary. This generates a codimension-2 (1D) nested boundary at the intersection. We also connect these novel boundaries to their previously discovered counterpart in the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory, equivalent to three copies of 3D toric codes, where the $S$ and $T$ domain walls correspond to gauged symmetry-protected topological (SPT) defects. New boundaries are produced whenever the corresponding symmetry of the SPT defect remains unbroken on the boundary. Applications of the magic boundaries include implementing fault-tolerant non-Clifford logical gates, e.g., in the context of fractal topological codes.</description>
