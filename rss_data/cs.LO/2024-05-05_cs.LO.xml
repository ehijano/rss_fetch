      <title>Clones, closed categories, and combinatory logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an exposition of the semantics of the simply-typed lambda-calculus, and its linear and ordered variants, using multi-ary structures. We define universal properties for multicategories, and use these to derive familiar rules for products, tensors, and exponentials. Finally we explain how to recover both the category-theoretic syntactic model and its semantic interpretation from the multi-ary framework.
  We then use these ideas to study the semantic interpretation of combinatory logic and the simply-typed lambda-calculus without products. We introduce extensional SK-clones and show these are sound and complete for both combinatory logic with extensional weak equality and the simply-typed lambda-calculus without products. We then show such SK-clones are equivalent to a variant of closed categories called SK-categories, so the simply-typed lambda-calculus without products is the internal language of SK-categories. As a corollary, we deduce that SK-categories have the same relationship to cartesian monoidal categories that closed categories have to monoidal categories.</description>

      <title>Rings with common division, common meadows and their conditional equational theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the consequences of having a total division operation $\frac{x}{y}$ on commutative rings. We consider two forms of binary division, one derived from a unary inverse, the other defined directly as a general operation; each are made total by setting $1/0$ equal to an error value $\bot$, which is added to the ring. Such totalised divisions we call common divisions. In a field the two forms are equivalent and we have a finite equational axiomatisation $E$ that is complete for the equational theory of fields equipped with common division, called common meadows. These equational axioms $E$ turn out to be true of commutative rings with common division but only when defined via inverses. We explore these axioms $E$ and their role in seeking a completeness theorem for the conditional equational theory of common meadows. We prove they are complete for the conditional equational theory of commutative rings with inverse based common division. By adding a new proof rule, we can prove a completeness theorem for the conditional equational theory of common meadows. Although, the equational axioms $E$ fail with common division defined directly, we observe that the direct division does satisfies the equations in $E$ under a new congruence for partial terms called eager equality.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Pick's Theorem in Isabelle/HOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize Pick's theorem for finding the area of a simple polygon whose vertices are integral lattice points. We are inspired by John Harrison's formalization of Pick's theorem in HOL Light, but tailor our proof approach to avoid a primary challenge point in his formalization, which is proving that any polygon with more than three vertices can be split (in its interior) by a line between some two vertices. We detail the approach we use to avoid this step and reflect on the pros and cons of our eventual formalization strategy. We use the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL, and our formalization involves augmenting the existing geometry libraries in various foundational ways (e.g., by adding the definition of a polygon and formalizing some key properties thereof).</description>

      <title>Cut elimination for Cyclic Proofs: A Case Study in Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider modal logic extended with the well-known temporal operator `eventually' and provide a cut-elimination procedure for a cyclic sequent calculus that captures this fragment. The work showcases an adaptation of the reductive cut-elimination method to cyclic calculi. Notably, the proposed algorithm applies to a cyclic proof and directly outputs a cyclic cut-free proof without appealing to intermediate machinery for regularising the end proof.</description>

      <title>On the Relative Completeness of Satisfaction-based Quantum Hoare Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hoare logic (QHL) is a formal verification tool specifically designed to ensure the correctness of quantum programs. There has been an ongoing challenge to achieve a relatively complete satisfaction-based QHL with while-loop since its inception in 2006. This paper presents a solution by proposing the first relatively complete satisfaction-based QHL with while-loop. The completeness is proved in two steps. First, we establish a semantics and proof system of Hoare triples with quantum programs and deterministic assertions. Then, by utilizing the weakest precondition of deterministic assertion, we construct the weakest preterm calculus of probabilistic expressions. The relative completeness of QHL is then obtained as a consequence of the weakest preterm calculus. Using our QHL, we formally verify the correctness of Deutsch's algorithm and quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>A Logic of Sattestation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a logic for reasoning about contextual trust for web addresses, provide a Kripke semantics for it, and prove its soundness under reasonable assumptions about principals' policies.
  Self-Authenticating Traditional Addresses (SATAs) are valid DNS addresses or URLs that are generally meaningful -- to both humans and web infrastructure -- and contain a commitment to a public key in the address itself. Trust in web addresses is currently established via domain name registration, TLS certificates, and other hierarchical elements of the internet infrastructure. SATAs support such structural roots of trust but also complementary contextual roots associated with descriptive properties. The existing structural roots leave web connections open to a variety of well-documented and significant hijack vulnerabilities. Contextual trust roots provide, among other things, stronger resistance to such vulnerabilities.
  We also consider labeled SATAs, which include descriptive properties such as that a SATA is an address for a news organization, a site belonging to a particular government or company, a site with information about a certain topic, etc. Our logic addresses both trust in the bound together identity of the address and trust in the binding of labels to it. Our logic allows reasoning about delegation of trust with respect to specified labels, relationships between labels that provide more or less specific information, and the interaction between these two aspects.
  In addition to soundness, we prove that if a principal trusts a particular identity (possibly with label), then either this trust is initially assumed, or there is a trust chain of delegations to this from initial trust assumptions. We also present an algorithm that effectively derives all possible trust statements from the set of initial trust assumptions and show it to be sound, complete, and terminating.</description>

      <title>A semantic loss for ontology classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are often unaware of the inherent constraints of the task they are applied to. However, many downstream tasks require logical consistency. For ontology classification tasks, such constraints include subsumption and disjointness relations between classes.
  In order to increase the consistency of deep learning models, we propose a semantic loss that combines label-based loss with terms penalising subsumption- or disjointness-violations. Our evaluation on the ChEBI ontology shows that the semantic loss is able to decrease the number of consistency violations by several orders of magnitude without decreasing the classification performance. In addition, we use the semantic loss for unsupervised learning. We show that this can further improve consistency on data from a distribution outside the scope of the supervised training.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology of directed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore links between natural homology and persistent homology for the classification of directed spaces. The former is an algebraic invariant of directed spaces, a semantic model of concurrent programs. The latter was developed in the context of topological data analysis, in which topological properties of point-cloud data sets are extracted while eliminating noise. In both approaches, the evolution homological properties are tracked through a sequence of inclusions of usual topological spaces. Exploiting this similarity, we show that natural homology may be considered a persistence object, and may be calculated as a colimit of uni-dimensional persistent homologies along traces. Finally, we suggest further links and avenues of future work in this direction.</description>
