      <title>Iterative Joint Detection of Kalman Filter and Channel Decoder for Sensor-to-Controller Link in Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative joint detection algorithm of Kalman filter (KF) and channel decoder for the sensor-to-controller link of wireless networked control systems, which utilizes the prior information of control system to improve the control and communication performance. In the algorithm, we first use the KF to estimate the probability density of the control system outputs and calculate the prior probability of received signals to assist decoding. Then, the possible outputs of the control system are traversed to update the prior probability in order to implement iterative detection. The simulation results show that the prior information can reduce the block error rate performance of communications to improve the root mean square error performance of controls.</description>

      <title>Optimal Secure Coded Distributed Computation over all Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct optimal secure coded distributed schemes that extend the known optimal constructions over fields of characteristic 0 to all fields. A serendipitous result is that we can encode \emph{all} functions over finite fields with a recovery threshold proportional to the complexity (tensor rank or multiplicative); this is due to the well-known result that all functions over a finite field can be represented as multivariate polynomials (or symmetric tensors). We get that a tensor of order $\ell$ (or a multivariate polynomial of degree $\ell$) can be computed in the faulty network of $N$ nodes setting within a factor of $\ell$ and an additive term depending on the genus of a code with $N$ rational points and distance covering the number of faulty servers; in particular, we present a coding scheme for general matrix multiplication of two $m \times m $ matrices with a recovery threshold of $2 m^{\omega } -1+g$ where $\omega $ is the exponent of matrix multiplication which is optimal for coding schemes using AG codes. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions for which the Hadamard-Shur product of general linear codes gives a similar recovery threshold, which we call \textit{log-additive codes}. Finally, we show that evaluation codes with a \textit{curve degree} function (first defined in [Ben-Sasson et al. (STOC '13)]) that have well-behaved zero sets are log-additive.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Simplified Design for Uniform Service Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional cellular networks, users at the cell edge often suffer from poor quality of service (QoS) due to large distance-dependent path loss and severe inter-cell interference. While cell-free (CF) massive multi-input multi-out (MIMO) mitigates this issue by distributing access points (APs) to ensure uniform QoS, the deployment of numerous distributed APs and a fronthaul network incurs high infrastructure costs. To balance performance and cost efficiency, this article proposes a simplified design called hierarchical cell-free (HCF) massive MIMO. The key idea is to reduce the number of APs, thus minimizing the scale of the fronthaul network. The antennas from the decommissioned APs are aggregated at a central base station (cBS), which also serves as the coordinator for distributed APs. We derive closed-form expressions for uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) for HCF, CF, and cellular massive MIMO under pilot contamination and correlated fading channels, considering the use of multi-antenna APs. Numerical results confirm that the hierarchical architecture achieves $95\%$-likely per-user SE comparable to CF, enhancing cell-edge user rates in cellular systems by over 100 times, while significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the fronthaul network in CF. We develop max-min fairness algorithms for joint power control of the cBS and APs in the downlink, and the users in the uplink. These algorithms not only boost fairness and system capacity but also dramatically lower transmission power, e.g., achieving over $70\%$ savings in uplink, particularly beneficial for battery-powered mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Symbiotic Radio: Exploiting Tradeoffs in Hybrid Active-Passive Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic radio (SR), a novel energy- and spectrum-sharing paradigm of backscatter communications (BC), has been deemed a promising solution for ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT), enabling ultra-low power consumption and massive connectivity. However, A-IoT nodes utilizing BC suffer from low transmission rates, which may limit the applications of SR in A-IoT scenarios with data transmission requirements. To address this issue, in this article, we introduce hybrid active-passive communications (HAPC) into SR by exploiting tradeoffs between transmission rate and power consumption. We first present an overview of novel BC paradigms including ambient BC and SR. Then, a novel HAPC-enabled SR is proposed to enhance the transmission rate of A-IoT nodes. Furthermore, within this paradigm, we investigate the resource allocation scheme and present preliminary research results. Simulation results show that the transmission rate of A-IoT nodes in the proposed HAPC-enabled SR surpasses that in traditional SR. Finally, we discuss open issues related to HAPC-enabled SR.</description>

      <title>Demand Private Coded Caching: Small Cache Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the demand private coded caching problem, which is an $(N,K)$ coded caching problem with $N$ files, $K$ users, each equipped with a cache of size $M$, and an additional privacy constraint on user demands, i.e., each user can not gain any information about the demands of other users. We focus on scenarios where the size of users' caches is small, aiming to further characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. We first present a new virtual-user-based achievable scheme for arbitrary number of users and files, and two MDS-code-based achievable schemes for the case $N \le K$. With a newly derived converse bound for the case $N \le K$, these proposed schemes lead to the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for $M \in \big[0, \frac{N}{(K+1)(N-1)} \big] $ where $N \le K \le 2N-2$, and the optimal memory-rate tradeoff for $M \in \big[0, \frac{1}{K+1} \big] $ where $ K &gt; 2N-2$. Moreover, for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, by deriving another new converse bound, the optimal memory-rate tradeoff is characterized for $M\in \big[0,\frac{2}{K}\big] \cup \big[\frac{2(K-1)}{K+1},2\big]$. Finally, we provide the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for 2 files and 3 users.</description>

      <title>Secret Sharing in the Rank Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between secret sharing and matroid theory is well established. In this paper, we generalize the concepts of secret sharing and matroid ports to $q$-polymatroids. Specifically, we introduce the notion of an access structure on a vector space, and consider properties related to duality, minors, and the relationship to $q$-polymatroids. Finally, we show how rank-metric codes give rise to secret sharing schemes within this framework.</description>

      <title>Rack-Aware Minimum Storage Partially Cooperative Regenerating Codes with Small Sub-Packetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rack-aware model, there are $\bar{n}$ racks each of which has $u$ nodes with the same storage capacity. Assume that there are $h$ failed nodes uniformly distributed in $\bar{h}$ host racks ( defined as racks containing failed nodes), each rack containing $h/\bar{h}$ failed nodes where $h$ is divisible by $\bar{h}$. Then together with its internal helper nodes, each host rack downloads recovery data from $\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its failed nodes. The repair bandwidth is defined as the total inter-rack data transfer required for failures recovery, as the intra-rack communication does not contribute to this cost. The full cooperative repair model requires that each host rack must exchange the data with all the other $\bar{h}$ host racks during the cooperative repair phase. However, in the partial cooperative repair model, each host rack only needs to exchange data with $\bar{h}-\delta\ (1\leq\delta\leq\bar{h}-1)$ other host racks, during the cooperative repair phase. In this paper, we focus on the rack-aware minimum storage partially cooperative regenerating (MSPCR) codes for repairing the $h$ node failures. We first derive the lower bound on the repair bandwidth for rack-aware MSPCR codes using extremal combinatorics, and then construct two classes of optimal repair schemes for rack-aware MSPCR codes with small sub-packetization level. In particular, when $\delta=1$, our second codes reduce to rack-aware minimum-storage cooperative regenerating (MSCR) codes, while achieving an $(\bar{h}+1)$-fold reduction in sub-packetization level compared to known rack-aware MSCR codes.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization of Kitaev Codes as Generalized Bicycle Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface codes have historically been the dominant choice for quantum error correction due to their superior error threshold performance. However, recently, a new class of Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes, constructed from binary circulant matrices with three non-zero elements per row, achieved comparable performance with fewer physical qubits and higher encoding efficiency.
  In this article, we focus on a subclass of GB codes, which are constructed from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two non-zero elements per row.
  We introduce a family of codes that generalizes both standard and optimized Kitaev codes for which we have a lower bound on their minimum distance, ensuring performance better than standard Kitaev codes. These codes exhibit parameters of the form $ [| 2n , 2, \geq \sqrt{n} |] $ where $ n$ is a factor of $ 1 + d^2 $. For code lengths below 200, our analysis yields $21$ codes, including $7$ codes from Pryadko and Wang's database, and unveils $14$ new codes with enhanced minimum distance compared to standard Kitaev codes. Among these, $3$ surpass all previously known weight-4 GB codes for distances $4$, $8$, and $12$.</description>

      <title>Achievable Rates and Error Probability Bounds of Frequency-based Channels of Unlimited Input Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a molecular channel, in which messages are encoded to the frequency of objects in a pool, and whose output during reading time is a noisy version of the input frequencies, as obtained by sampling with replacement from the pool. Motivated by recent DNA storage techniques, we focus on the regime in which the input resolution is unlimited. We propose two error probability bounds for this channel; the first bound is based on random coding analysis of the error probability of the maximum likelihood decoder and the second bound is derived by code expurgation techniques. We deduce an achievable bound on the capacity of this channel, and compare it to both the achievable bounds under limited input resolution, as well as to a converse bound.</description>

      <title>Constructing Hamiltonian Decompositions of Complete $k$-Uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the wide-ranging applications of Hamiltonian decompositions in distributed computing, coded caching, routing, resource allocation, load balancing, and fault tolerance, our work presents a comprehensive design for Hamiltonian decompositions of complete $k$-uniform hypergraphs $K_n^k$. Building upon the resolution of the long-standing conjecture of the existence of Hamiltonian decompositions of complete hypergraphs, a problem that was resolved using existence-based methods, our contribution goes beyond the previous explicit designs, which were confined to the specific cases of $k=2$ and $k=3$, by providing explicit designs for all $k$ and $n$ prime, allowing for a broad applicability of Hamiltonian decompositions in various settings.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Shaping in MIMO: Going Beyond 1.53dB AWGN Gain With the Non-Linear Demapper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constellation shaping is a well-established method to improve upon a regular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). It is known that the gain achieved by any shaping method for an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is upper-bounded by 1.53dB. However, the situation becomes less clear in the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) setting.
  In this paper, we study the application of probabilistic shaping for MIMO channels. We utilize an efficient near-optimal demapper based on sphere decoding (SD) and demonstrate that it is possible to achieve more than 2dB gains, breaking the AWGN limit. It becomes possible because both signal and interference are shaped and the non-linear methods can capture this property and leverage on it to improve the demodulation performance.</description>

      <title>Information Freshness in Dynamic Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a source that shares updates with a network of $n$ gossiping nodes. The network's topology switches between two arbitrary topologies, with switching governed by a two-state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) process. Information freshness is well-understood for static networks. This work evaluates the impact of time-varying connections on information freshness. In order to quantify the freshness of information, we use the version age of information metric. If the two networks have static long-term average version ages of $f_1(n)$ and $f_2(n)$ with $f_1(n) \ll f_2(n)$, then the version age of the varying-topologies network is related to $f_1(n)$, $f_2(n)$, and the transition rates in the CTMC. If the transition rates in the CTMC are faster than $f_1(n)$, the average version age of the varying-topologies network is $f_1(n)$. Further, we observe that the behavior of a vanishingly small fraction of nodes can severely impact the long-term average version age of a network in a negative way. This motivates the definition of a typical set of nodes in the network. We evaluate the impact of fast and slow CTMC transition rates on the typical set of nodes.</description>

      <title>How fake news can turn against its spreader</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When different information sources on a given topic are combined, they interact in a nontrivial manner for a rational receiver of these information sources. Suppose that there are two information sources, one is genuine and the other contains disinformation. It is shown that under the conditions that the signal-to-noise ratio of the genuine information source is sufficiently large, and that the noise terms in the two information sources are positively correlated, the effect of disinformation is reversed from its original intent. That is, the effect of disinformation on a receiver of both information sources, who is unaware of the existence of disinformation, is to generate an opposite interpretation. While the condition in which this phenomenon occurs cannot always be ensured, when it is satisfied, the effect provides an effective way of countering the impacts of disinformation.</description>

      <title>AI Ethics and Social Norms: Exploring ChatGPT's Capabilities From What to How</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using LLMs in healthcare, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Social Computing requires the examination of ethical and social norms to ensure safe incorporation into human life. We conducted a mixed-method study, including an online survey with 111 participants and an interview study with 38 experts, to investigate the AI ethics and social norms in ChatGPT as everyday life tools. This study aims to evaluate whether ChatGPT in an empirical context operates following ethics and social norms, which is critical for understanding actions in industrial and academic research and achieving machine ethics. The findings of this study provide initial insights into six important aspects of AI ethics, including bias, trustworthiness, security, toxicology, social norms, and ethical data. Significant obstacles related to transparency and bias in unsupervised data collection methods are identified as ChatGPT's ethical concerns.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Analysis of Parallelized Computing at the Extreme Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme Edge Computing (EEC) pushes computing even closer to end users than traditional Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), harnessing the idle resources of Extreme Edge Devices (EEDs) to enable low-latency, distributed processing. However, EEC faces key challenges, including spatial randomness in device distribution, limited EED computational power necessitating parallel task execution, vulnerability to failure, and temporal randomness due to variability in wireless communication and execution times. These challenges highlight the need for a rigorous analytical framework to evaluate EEC performance. We present the first spatiotemporal mathematical model for EEC over large-scale millimeter-wave networks. Utilizing stochastic geometry and an Absorbing Continuous-Time Markov Chain (ACTMC), the framework captures the complex interaction between communication and computation performance, including their temporal overlap during parallel execution. We evaluate two key metrics: average task response delay and task completion probability. Together, they provide a holistic view of latency and reliability. The analysis considers fundamental offloading strategies, including randomized and location-aware schemes, while accounting for EED failures. Results show that there exists an optimal task segmentation that minimizes delay. Under limited EED availability, we investigate a bias-based EEC and MEC collaboration that offloads excess demand to MEC resources, effectively reducing congestion and improving system responsiveness.</description>

      <title>Advanced Channel Decomposition Techniques in OTFS: A GSVD Approach for Multi-User Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-user downlink system for two users based on the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. The design leverages the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of the channels between the base station and the two users, applying precoding and detection matrices based on the right and left singular vectors, respectively. We derive the analytical expressions for three scenarios and present the corresponding simulation results. These results demonstrate that, in terms of bit error rate (BER), the proposed system outperforms the conventional multi-user OTFS system in two scenarios when using minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizers or precoder, both for perfect channel state information and for a scenario with channel estimation errors. In the third scenario, the design is equivalent to zero-forcing (ZF) precoding at the transmitter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining optimal directed intersection representations of DAGs in a model introduced by Kostochka, Liu, Machado, and Milenkovic [ISIT2019]: vertices are assigned color sets so that there is an arc from a vertex $u$ to a vertex $v$ if and only if their color sets have nonempty intersection and $v$ gets assigned strictly more colors than $u$, and the goal is to minimize the total number of colors. We show that the problem is polynomially solvable in the class of triangle-free and Hamiltonian DAGs and also disclose the relationship of this problem with several other models of intersection representations of graphs and digraphs.</description>

      <title>Generalization Guarantees for Multi-View Representation Learning and Application to Regularization via Gaussian Product Mixture Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of distributed multi-view representation learning. In this problem, $K$ agents observe each one distinct, possibly statistically correlated, view and independently extracts from it a suitable representation in a manner that a decoder that gets all $K$ representations estimates correctly the hidden label. In the absence of any explicit coordination between the agents, a central question is: what should each agent extract from its view that is necessary and sufficient for a correct estimation at the decoder? In this paper, we investigate this question from a generalization error perspective. First, we establish several generalization bounds in terms of the relative entropy between the distribution of the representations extracted from training and "test" datasets and a data-dependent symmetric prior, i.e., the Minimum Description Length (MDL) of the latent variables for all views and training and test datasets. Then, we use the obtained bounds to devise a regularizer; and investigate in depth the question of the selection of a suitable prior. In particular, we show and conduct experiments that illustrate that our data-dependent Gaussian mixture priors with judiciously chosen weights lead to good performance. For single-view settings (i.e., $K=1$), our experimental results are shown to outperform existing prior art Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) and Category-Dependent VIB (CDVIB) approaches. Interestingly, we show that a weighted attention mechanism emerges naturally in this setting. Finally, for the multi-view setting, we show that the selection of the joint prior as a Gaussians product mixture induces a Gaussian mixture marginal prior for each marginal view and implicitly encourages the agents to extract and output redundant features, a finding which is somewhat counter-intuitive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We treat the optimal linear filtering problem for a sum of two second order uncorrelated generalized stochastic processes. This is an operator equation involving covariance operators. We study both the wide-sense stationary case and the non-stationary case. In the former case the equation simplifies into a convolution equation. The solution is the Radon--Nikodym derivative between non-negative tempered Radon measures, for signal and signal plus noise respectively, in the frequency domain. In the non-stationary case we work with pseudodifferential operators with symbols in Sj\"ostrand modulation spaces which admits the use of its spectral invariance properties.</description>

      <title>Leave-One-Out Analysis for Nonconvex Robust Matrix Completion with General Thresholding Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust matrix completion (RMC), where the partially observed entries of an underlying low-rank matrix is corrupted by sparse noise. Existing analysis of the non-convex methods for this problem either requires the explicit but empirically redundant regularization in the algorithm or requires sample splitting in the analysis. In this paper, we consider a simple yet efficient nonconvex method which alternates between a projected gradient step for the low-rank part and a thresholding step for the sparse noise part. Inspired by leave-one out analysis for low rank matrix completion, it is established that the method can achieve linear convergence for a general class of thresholding functions, including for example soft-thresholding and SCAD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first leave-one-out analysis on a nonconvex method for RMC. Additionally, when applying our result to low rank matrix completion, it improves the sampling complexity of existing result for the singular value projection method.</description>

      <title>Zero Estimation Cost Strategy for Witsenhausen Counterexample with Causal Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a zero estimation cost (ZEC) scheme for causal-encoding noncausal-decoding vector-valued Witsenhausen counterexample based on the coordination coding result. In contrast to source coding, our goal is to communicate a controlled system state. The introduced ZEC scheme is a joint control-communication approach that transforms the system state into a sequence that can be efficiently communicated using block coding. Numerical results show that our approach significantly reduces the power required for achieving zero-estimation-cost state reconstruction at the decoder. In the second part, we introduce a more general non-zero estimation cost (Non-ZEC) scheme. We observe numerically that the Non-ZEC scheme operates as a time-sharing mechanism between the two-point strategy and the ZEC scheme. Overall, by leveraging block-coding gain, our proposed methods substantially improve the power-estimation trade-off for Witsenhausen counterexample.</description>

      <title>The LZ78 Source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of processes generated according to sequential probability assignments induced by the LZ78 universal compressor. We characterize entropic and distributional properties such as their entropy and relative entropy rates, finite-state compressibility and log loss of their realizations, and the empirical distributions that they induce. Though not quite stationary, these sources are "almost stationary and ergodic;" similar to stationary and ergodic processes, they satisfy a Shannon-McMillan-Breiman-type property: the normalized log probability of their realizations converges almost surely to their entropy rate. Further, they are locally "almost i.i.d." in the sense that the finite-dimensional empirical distributions of their realizations converge almost surely to a deterministic i.i.d. law. However, unlike stationary ergodic sources, the finite-state compressibility of their realizations is almost surely strictly larger than their entropy rate by a "Jensen gap." We present simulations demonstrating the theoretical results. Among their potential uses, these sources allow to gauge the performance of sequential probability models on non-Markovian non-stationary data.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a new soft-in soft-out decoder called soft-output from covered space (SOCS) decoder. It estimates the a posteriori reliability based on the space explored by a list decoder, i.e., the set of vectors for which the list decoder knows whether they are codewords. This approach enables a more accurate calculation of the a posteriori reliability and results in gains of up to 0.25$\,$dB for turbo product decoding with SOCS compared to Chase-Pyndiah decoding.</description>

      <title>Can Kernel Methods Explain How the Data Affects Neural Collapse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A vast amount of literature has recently focused on the "Neural Collapse" (NC) phenomenon, which emerges when training neural network (NN) classifiers beyond the zero training error point. The core component of NC is the decrease in the within-class variability of the network's deepest features, dubbed as NC1. The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified unconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the extent of collapse. To address this limitation of UFMs, this paper explores the possibility of analyzing NC1 using kernels associated with shallow NNs. We begin by formulating an NC1 metric as a function of the kernel. Then, we specialize it to the NN Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP) and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), associated with wide networks at initialization and during gradient-based training with a small learning rate, respectively. As a key result, we show that the NTK does not represent more collapsed features than the NNGP for Gaussian data of arbitrary dimensions. This showcases the limitations of data-independent kernels such as NTK in approximating the NC behavior of NNs. As an alternative to NTK, we then empirically explore a recently proposed data-aware Gaussian Process kernel, which generalizes NNGP to model feature learning. We show that this kernel yields lower NC1 than NNGP but may not follow the trends of the shallow NN. Our study demonstrates that adaptivity to data may allow kernel-based analysis of NC, though further advancements in this area are still needed. A nice byproduct of our study is showing both theoretically and empirically that the choice of nonlinear activation function affects NC1 (with ERF yielding lower values than ReLU).

      <title>Improved Contact Graph Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks with Capacity and Buffer Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite communications present challenging characteristics. Continuous end-to-end connectivity may not be available due to the large distances between satellites. Moreover, resources such as link capacity and buffer memory may be limited. Routing in satellite networks is therefore both complex and crucial to avoid packet losses and long delays. The Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) paradigm has emerged as an efficient solution for managing these challenging networks. Contact Graph Routing (CGR), a deterministic routing algorithm, is one of the most popular DTN algorithms. CGR is compatible with the ``store, carry, and forward" principle, whereby a node receives a message and stores it in its buffer until a transmission opportunity becomes available. However, CGR relies on simplified models to incorporate potential constraints in the route search. For instance, the linear volume assumption is often used to consider capacity constraints. Moreover, capacity management and buffer management are mostly performed during the forwarding phase, once an issue has occurred. In this paper, we propose taking measures before or during the route search in order to find routes that respect both contact-capacity and node-buffer limits. We introduce the contact splitting and edge pruning operations to effectively account for the routing constraints. This ensures that CGR outputs the optimal solution among the subset of valid solutions. The proposed approach can also be used to book resources to be used in case of issues during the forwarding phase.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning and Adversarial Disentanglement for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication systems have emerged as a promising approach to achieving efficient and intelligent data transmission, where only information relevant to a specific task is communicated. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and subpar performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial disentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture task-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard task-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the lack of reliable and reproducible methods to gain insight into the informativeness and minimality of the encoded feature vectors, we introduce a new technique to compute the information retention index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a proxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input, reflecting the minimality of the encoded features. The IRI quantifies the minimality and informativeness of the encoded feature vectors across different task-oriented communication techniques. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy preservation, and IRI. CLAD achieves a predictive performance improvement of around 2.5-3%, along with a 77-90% reduction in IRI and a 57-76% decrease in adversarial attribute inference attack accuracy.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multiple Testing with False Discovery Rate Control in the Presence of Byzantines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies distributed multiple testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control in the presence of Byzantine attacks, where an adversary captures a fraction of the nodes and corrupts their reported p-values. We focus on two baseline attack models: an oracle model with the full knowledge of which hypotheses are true nulls, and a practical attack model that leverages the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure locally to classify which p-values follow the true null hypotheses. We provide a thorough characterization of how both attack models affect the global FDR, which in turn motivates counter-attack strategies and stronger attack models. Our extensive simulation studies confirm the theoretical results, highlight key design trade-offs under attacks and countermeasures, and provide insights into more sophisticated attacks.</description>
