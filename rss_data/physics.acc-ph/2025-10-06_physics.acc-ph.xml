      <title>Status of the MARS code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report describes major features of the most recent version of the MARS code as well as ongoing developments. The list of features includes various options for geometry models, a beam line builder based on MADX code, import of geometry models in GDML format, use of structured and unstructured meshes for scoring purposes, an update to the recent TENDL library for a number of projectiles at low energies (up to 250 MeV), and a recently implemented method to calculate spatial distribution of residual dose in a single computer run without an intermediate source. Examples of the code application to various projects are presented as well.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Low-beta Nb$_3$Sn Cavity for ATLAS and Future Ion Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a Nb$_3$Sn-coated low-beta superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity intended for accelerating ions. We aim to apply the cavity in ATLAS, our Argonne National Laboratory user facility for nuclear physics studies with ion beams in the energy range of 5-20 MeV/u. The Nb$_3$Sn-coated cavity, a 145 MHz quarter-wave optimized for ions moving with velocity $\beta$=v/c=0.08 exhibits an order-of-magnitude reduction in radiofrequency (RF) losses into helium at $4.4\,\mathrm{K}$ compared to a superconducting niobium (Nb) cavity at the same frequency and temperature. Experimentally measured fields are among the highest to date for any Nb$_3$Sn-coated cavity, reaching a peak surface magnetic field of 105 mT. We also present a practical solution to the problem of cavity frequency tuning. Tuning by mechanical deformation has been a challenge with Nb3Sn due to its brittle nature, however, using a set of techniques tailored to the properties of thin-film Nb$_3$Sn on Nb, we can repeatably tune the cavity to the ATLAS master clock frequency after it is cooled, while maintaining the excellent performance characteristics. The same Nb$_3$Sn cavity technology offers broad benefits for future ion accelerators.</description>

      <title>Physical Thickness Characterization of the FRIB Production Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FRIB heavy-ion accelerator, commissioned in 2022, is a leading facility
  for producing rare isotope beams (RIBs) and exploring nuclei beyond the limits of stability.
  These RIBs are produced via reactions between stable primary beams and a graphite target.
  Approximately 20-40 \% of the primary beam power is deposited in the target,
  requiring efficient thermal dissipation.
  Currently, FRIB operates with a primary beam power of up to 20 kW. To enhance thermal dissipation efficiency,
  a single-slice rotating graphite target with a diameter of approximately 30 cm is employed.
  The effective target region is a 1 cm-wide outer rim of the graphite disc.
  To achieve high RIB production rates, the areal thickness variation must be constrained within 2 \%.
  This paper presents physical thickness characterizations of FRIB production targets with various nominal thicknesses,
  measured using a custom-built non-contact thickness measurement apparatus.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Niobium Coaxial Cavity with $\sim0.1\,$second Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm int} \gtrsim 3\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm int}\sim90\,\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.</description>
