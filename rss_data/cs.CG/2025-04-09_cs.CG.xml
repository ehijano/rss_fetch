      <title>Sparse Bounded Hop-Spanners for Geometric Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new results on $2$- and $3$-hop spanners for geometric intersection graphs. These include improved upper and lower bounds for $2$- and $3$-hop spanners for many geometric intersection graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For example, we show that the intersection graph of $n$ balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a $2$-hop spanner of size $O^*\left(n^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2(2\lfloor d/2\rfloor +1)}}\right)$ and the intersection graph of $n$ fat axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a $2$-hop spanner of size $O(n \log^{d+1}n)$.
  Furthermore, we show that the intersection graph of general semi-algebraic objects in $\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a $3$-hop spanner of size $O^*\left(n^{\frac{3}{2}-\frac{1}{2(2D-1)}}\right)$, where $D$ is a parameter associated with the description complexity of the objects. For such families (or more specifically, for tetrahedra in $\mathbb{R}^3$), we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{\frac{4}{3}})$. For $3$-hop and axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we provide the upper bound $O(n \log ^{d-1}n)$ and lower bound $\Omega\left(n (\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})^{d-2}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Geometric Bipartite Matching Based Exact Algorithms for Server Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any given metric space, obtaining an offline optimal solution to the classical $k$-server problem can be reduced to solving a minimum-cost partial bipartite matching between two point sets $A$ and $B$ within that metric space.
  For $d$-dimensional $\ell_p$ metric space, we present an $\tilde{O}(\min\{nk, n^{2-\frac{1}{2d+1}}\log \Delta\}\cdot \Phi(n))$ time algorithm for solving this instance of minimum-cost partial bipartite matching; here, $\Delta$ represents the spread of the point set, and $\Phi(n)$ is the query/update time of a $d$-dimensional dynamic weighted nearest neighbor data structure. Our algorithm improves upon prior algorithms that require at least $\Omega(nk\Phi(n))$ time. The design of minimum-cost (partial) bipartite matching algorithms that make sub-quadratic queries to a weighted nearest-neighbor data structure, even for bounded spread instances, is a major open problem in computational geometry. We resolve this problem at least for the instances that are generated by the offline version of the $k$-server problem.
  Our algorithm employs a hierarchical partitioning approach, dividing the points of $A\cup B$ into rectangles. It maintains a minimum-cost partial matching where any point $b \in B$ is either matched to a point $a\in A$ or to the boundary of the rectangle it is located in. The algorithm involves iteratively merging pairs of rectangles by erasing the shared boundary between them and recomputing the minimum-cost partial matching. This continues until all boundaries are erased and we obtain the desired minimum-cost partial matching of $A$ and $B$. We exploit geometry in our analysis to show that each point participates in only $\tilde{O}(n^{1-\frac{1}{2d+1}}\log \Delta)$ number of augmenting paths, leading to a total execution time of $\tilde{O}(n^{2-\frac{1}{2d+1}}\Phi(n)\log \Delta)$.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Reeds-Shepp and Under-Specified Reeds-Shepp Algorithms for Mobile Robot Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a simple and intuitive method for accelerating optimal Reeds-Shepp path computation. Our approach uses geometrical reasoning to analyze the behavior of optimal paths, resulting in a new partitioning of the state space and a further reduction in the minimal set of viable paths. We revisit and reimplement classic methodologies from the literature, which lack contemporary open-source implementations, to serve as benchmarks for evaluating our method. Additionally, we address the under-specified Reeds-Shepp planning problem where the final orientation is unspecified. We perform exhaustive experiments to validate our solutions. Compared to the modern C++ implementation of the original Reeds-Shepp solution in the Open Motion Planning Library, our method demonstrates a 15x speedup, while classic methods achieve a 5.79x speedup. Both approaches exhibit machine-precision differences in path lengths compared to the original solution. We release our proposed C++ implementations for both the accelerated and under-specified Reeds-Shepp problems as open-source code.</description>

      <title>Soft cells, Kelvin's foam and the minimal surfaces of Schwarz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced a new class of shapes, called soft cells which fill space as soft tilings without gaps and overlaps while minimizing the number of sharp corners. We introduced the edge bending algorithm that deforms a polyhedral tiling into a soft tiling and we proved that an infinite class of polyhedral tilings can be smoothly deformed into standard soft tilings. Here, we demonstrate that certain triply periodic minimal surfaces naturally give rise to non-standard soft tilings. By extending the edge-bending algorithm, we further establish that the soft tilings derived from the Schwarz P and Schwarz D surfaces can be continuously transformed into one another through a one-parameter family of intermediate non-standard soft tilings. Notably, by carrying its combinatorial structure, both resulting tilings belong to the first order equivalence class of the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling on the body-centered cubic bcc lattice, highlighting a deep geometric connection underlying these minimal surface configurations. By requiring identical end-tangents for edges in a first order class, we also define second order equivalence classes among tilings and prove that there exist exactly two such classes among soft tilings which share the full symmetry group of the DV-bcc tiling. Additionally, we construct a one-parameter family of tilings bridging standard and non-standard soft tilings, explicitly including the classic Kelvin foam structure as an intermediate configuration. This construction highlights that both the soft cells themselves and the geometric methods employed in their generation provide valuable insights into the structural principles underlying natural forms. We also present the soft tiling induced by the gyroid structure.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Surface Parametrization with HAND and LEG: Hausdorff Approximation from Node-wise Distances and Localized Energy for Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface parametrization is a crucial part in various fields, having applications in computer graphic, medical imaging, scientific computing and computational engineering. The majority of surface parametrization approaches are performed on triangular meshes. On the contrary, the theories and methods of point cloud surface parametrization are less researched, despite its rising significance. In this work, we compute surface parametrization in an optimization approach using neural networks, with novel loss functions introduced without extrinsic information, together with theoretical analyses. Based on the theory, we develop an optimization algorithm to improve the parametrization quality. Using our methods, general open surfaces can be parametrized in either free-boundary manner or with arbitrary domain constraints. Landmark matching can also be enforced under our framework. Numerical experiments are conducted and presented, along with applications including surface reconstruction and boundary detection.</description>
