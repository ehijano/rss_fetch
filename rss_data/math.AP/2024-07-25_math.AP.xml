      <title>Direct resonance problem for Rayleigh seismic surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the direct resonance problem for Rayleigh seismic surface waves and obtain a constraint on the location of resonances and establish a forbidden domain as the main result. In order to obtain the main result we make a Pekeris-Markushevich transformation of the Rayleigh system with free surface boundary condition such that we get a matrix Schr\"odinger-type form of it. We obtain parity and analytical properties of its fundamental solutions, which are needed to prove the main theorem. We construct a function made up by Rayleigh determinants factors, which is proven to be entire, of exponential type and in the Cartwright class and leads to the constraint on the location of resonances.</description>

      <title>Higher order parabolic systems with piecewise DMO and H\"{o}lder continuous coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with divergence form, higher-order parabolic systems in a cylindrical domain with a finite number of subdomains. We establish $L_\infty$ and Schauder estimates of solutions when the leading coefficients and the non-homogeneous term exhibit piecewise Dini mean oscillation and piecewise H\"{o}lder continuity, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our results are new for higher-order elliptic and parabolic systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We found a special divergence structure for the $\sigma_k$-Yamabe operator and use it to get a monotonicity formula. We also get an interior $L^{\infty}$ estimate via its $L^1$ norm for the $\sigma_k$-Yamabe operator when $1\le k \le \frac{n}{2}$.  Combining these two tools, we prove the weak continuity of the $\sigma_k$-Yamabe measure with respect to convergence in measure.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions to the fractional semilinear heat equation with a singular inhomogeneous term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of solutions to the fractional semilinear heat equation with a singular inhomogeneous term. For this aim, we establish decay estimates of the fractional heat semigroup in several uniformly local Zygumnd spaces. Furthermore, we apply the real interpolation method in uniformly local Zygmund spaces to obtain sharp integral estimates on the inhomogeneous term and the nonlinear term. This enables us to find sharp sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to the fractional semilinear heat equation with a singular inhomogeneous term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a periodic higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the nonlinearity $u^k \partial_x u$, where $k$ is a natural number. We prove the norm inflation in a subspace of the Sobolev space $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for any $s \in \mathbb{R}$. In particular, the Cauchy problem is ill-posed in $H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for any $s \in \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Partial gradient regularity for parabolic systems with degenerate diffusion and H\"older continuous coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider vector valued weak solutions $u:\Omega_T\to \mathbb{R}^N$ with $N\in \mathbb{N}$ of degenerate or singular parabolic systems of type \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t u - \mathrm{div} \, a(z,u,Du) = 0 \qquad\text{in}\qquad \Omega_T= \Omega\times (0,T), \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ denotes an open set in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq 1$ and $T&gt;0$ a finite time. Assuming that the vector field $a$ is not of Uhlenbeck-type structure, satisfies $p$-growth assumptions and $(z,u)\mapsto a(z,u,\xi)$ is H\"older continuous for every $\xi\in \mathbb{R}^{Nn}$, we show that the gradient $Du$ is partially H\"older continuous, provided the vector field degenerates like that of the $p$-Laplacian for small gradients.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of Contact Lines: 2D Navier-Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the global a priori estimates in [Guo-Tice, J. Eur. Math. Soc. (2024)], we establish the well-posedness of a viscous fluid model satisfying the dynamic law for the contact line \begin{equation*} \mathscr{W}(\p_t\zeta(\pm\ell,t))=[\![\gamma]\!]\mp\sigma\frac{\p_1\zeta}{(1+|\p_1\zeta|^2)^{1/2}}(\pm\ell,t) \end{equation*} in 2D domain, where $\zeta(x_1,t)$ is a free surface with two contact points $\zeta(\pm\ell,t)$, $[\![\gamma]\!]$ and $\sigma$ are constants characterizing the solid-fluid-gas free energy, and the increasing $\mathscr{W}$ is the contact point velocity response function. Motivated by the energy-dissipation structure, our construction relies on the construction of a pressureless weak solution for the coupled velocity and free interface for the linearized problems, via a Galerkin approximation with a time-dependent basis and an artificial regularization for the capillary operator.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of a semilinear problem in heat conduction with long time memory and non-local diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the asymptotic behavior of a semilinear heat equation with long time memory and non-local diffusion is analyzed in the usual set-up for dynamical systems generated by differential equations with delay terms. This approach is different from the previous published literature on the long time behavior of heat equations with memory which is carried out by the Dafermos transformation. As a consequence, the obtained results provide complete information about the attracting sets for the original problem, instead of the transformed one. In particular, the proved results also generalize and complete previous literature in the local case.</description>

      <title>Some qualitative and quantitative properties of weak solutions to mixed anisotropic and nonlocal quasilinear elliptic and doubly nonlinear parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is twofold. In the first part of the article, we consider Brezis-Oswald problem involving the mixed anisotropic and nonlocal $p$-Laplace operator and establish existence, uniqueness, boundedness and strong maximum principle. Further, for some mixed anisotropic and nonlocal $p$-Laplace type equations, we obtain Sturmian comparison theorem, prove some comparsion results, nonexistence results, establish weighted Hardy type inequality and study a system of singular mixed anisotropic and nonlocal $p$-Laplace equations. One of the key ingredient is the combination of Picone identity already available in the separate local and nonlocal cases. In the second part of the article, we are mainly concerned with regularity estimates. To this end, in the elliptic setting, we establish weak Harnack inequality and semicontinuity results. Further, we consider a class of doubly nonlinear mixed anisotropic and nonlocal equations and prove semicontinuity results and pointwise behavior of solutions. These are based on suitable energy estimates and De Giorgi type lemmas and expansion of positivity. Finally, we establish various energy estimates which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic location and shape of the optimal favorable region in a Neumann spectral problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the study concerning the minimization of the positive principal eigenvalue associated with a weighted Neumann problem settled in a bounded regular domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$, $N\ge2$, for the weight varying in a suitable class of sign-changing bounded functions. Denoting with $u$ the optimal eigenfunction and with $D$ its super-level set, corresponding to the positivity set of the optimal weight, we prove that, as the measure of $D$ tends to zero, the unique maximum point of $u$, $P\in \partial \Omega$, tends to a point of maximal mean curvature of $\partial \Omega$. Furthermore, we show that $D$ is the intersection with $\Omega$ of a $C^{1,1}$ nearly spherical set, and we provide a quantitative estimate of the spherical asymmetry, which decays like a power of the measure of $D$.
  These results provide, in the small volume regime, a fully detailed answer to some long-standing questions in this framework.</description>

      <title>New bounds on the high Sobolev norms of the 1d NLS solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce modified energies that are suitable to get upper bounds on the high Sobolev norms for solutions to the $1$D periodic NLS. Our strategy is rather flexible and allows us to get a new and simpler proof of the bounds obtained by Bourgain in the case of the quintic nonlinearity, as well as its extension to the case of higher order nonlinearities. Our main ingredients are a combination of integration by parts and classical dispersive estimates.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional exponential mixing and ideal kinematic dynamo with randomized ABC flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the Lagrangian properties of a random version of the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) in a three-dimensional periodic box. We prove that the associated flow map possesses a positive top Lyapunov exponent and its associated one-point, two-point and projective Markov chains are geometrically ergodic. For a passive scalar, it follows that such a velocity is a space-time smooth exponentially mixing field, uniformly in the diffusivity coefficient. For a passive vector, it provides an example of a universal ideal (i.e. non-diffusive) kinematic dynamo.</description>

      <title>Well posedness of F. John's floating body problem for a fixed object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove the well-posedness of F. John's floating body problem in the case of a fixed object and for unsteady waves, in horizontal dimension $d=1$ and with a possibly emerging bottom. This problem describes the interactions of waves with a partially immersed object using the linearized Bernoulli equations. The fluid domain $\Omega$ therefore has corners where the object meets the free surface, which consists of various connected components. The energy space associated with this problem involves the space of traces on these different connected components of all functions in the Beppo-Levi space $\dot{H}^1(\Omega)$; we characterize this space, exhibiting non local effects linking the different connected components. We prove the well-posedness of the Laplace equation in corner domains, with mixed boundary conditions and Dirichlet data in this trace space, and study several properties of the associated Dirichlet-Neumann operator (self-adjointness, ellipticity properties, etc.). This trace space being only semi-normed, we cannot use standard semi-group theory to solve F. John's problem: one has to choose a realization of the homogeneous space (i.e. choose an adequate representative in the equivalence class) we are working with. When the fluid domain is bounded, this realization is obtained by imposing a zero-mass condition; for unbounded fluid domains, we have to choose a space-time realization which can be interpreted as a particular choice of the Bernoulli constant. Well-posedness in the energy space is then proved. Conditions for higher order regularity in times are then derived, which yield some limited space regularity that can be improved through smallness assumption on the contact angles. We finally show that higher order regularity away from the contact points can be achieved through weighted estimates.</description>

      <title>Solvability and optimal control of a multi-species Cahn-Hilliard-Keller-Segel tumor growth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an optimal control problem associated with a two-dimensional multi-species Cahn-Hilliard-Keller-Segel tumor growth model, which incorporates complex biological processes such as species diffusion, chemotaxis, angiogenesis, and nutrient consumption, resulting in a highly nonlinear system of nonlinear partial differential equations. The modeling derivation and corresponding analysis have been addressed in a previous contribution. Building on this foundation, the scope of this study involves investigating a distributed control problem with the goal of optimizing a tracking-type cost functional. This latter aims to minimize the deviation of tumor cell location from desired target configurations while penalizing the costs associated with implementing control measures, akin to introducing a suitable medication. Under appropriate mathematical assumptions, we demonstrate that sufficiently regular solutions exhibit continuous dependence on the control variable. Furthermore, we establish the existence of optimal controls and characterize the first-order necessary optimality conditions through a suitable variational inequality.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we provide two-weight inequalities for the heat flow on the whole space by applying the sparse domination. For power weights, such inequalities were given by several authors. Owing to the sparse domination, we can treat general weights in Muckenhoupt classes. As a application, we present the local and global existence results for the Hardy-H\'enon parabolic equation, which has a potential belonging to a Muckenhoupt class.</description>

      <title>A high-order, high-efficiency adaptive time filter algorithm for shale reservoir model based on coupled fluid flow with porous media flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a third-order time adaptive algorithm with less computation, low complexity is provided for shale reservoir model based on coupled fluid flow with porous media flow. The algorithm combines the three-step linear time filters method for simple post-processing and the second-order backward differential formula (BDF2), is third-order accurate and provides, at no extra computational complexity. At the same time, the time filter method can also be used to damp non-physical oscillations inherent in the BDF2 method, ensuring stability. We proves the variable time stepsize second-order backward differential formula plus time filter (BDF2-TF) algorithm's stability and the convergence properties of the fluid velocity u and hydraulic head $\phi$ in the $L^2$ norm with an order of $O(k_{n+1}^3 + h^3)$. In the experiments, the adaptive algorithm automatically adjusts the time step in response to the varying characteristics of different models, ensuring that errors are maintained within acceptable limits. This algorithm addresses the issue that high-order algorithms may select inappropriate time steps, resulting in instability or reduced precision of the numerical solution, thereby enhancing calculation accuracy and efficiency. We perform three-dimensional numerical experiments to verify the BDF2-TF algorithm's effectiveness, stability, and third-order convergence. Simultaneously, a simplified model is employed to simulate the process of shale oil extraction from reservoirs, further demonstrating the algorithm's practical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.09114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive homogenized bending shell theories starting from three dimensional nonlinear elasticity. The original three dimensional model contains three small parameters: the two homogenization scales $\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon^2$ of the material properties and the thickness $h$ of the shell. Depending on the asymptotic ratio of these three parameters, we obtain different asymptotic theories.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a novel system of flow equations that models the pressure deficit of a reservoir considered as a triple continuous medium formed by the rock matrix, vugular medium and fracture. In non-conventional reservoirs, the velocity of the fluid particles is altered due to physical and chemical phenomena caused by the interaction of the fluid with the medium, this behavior is defined as anomalous. A more exact model can be obtained with the inclusion of the memory formalism concept that can be expressed through the use of fractional derivatives. Using Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional derivative and Bessel functions, a semi-analytical solution is reached in the Laplace space.</description>

      <title>A phase-field approach to model evaporation from porous media: Modeling and upscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a phase-field model for evaporation from a porous medium by explicitly considering a vapor component together with the liquid and gas phases in the system. The phase-field model consists of the conservation of mass (for phases and vapor component), momentum, and energy. In addition, the evolution of the phase field is described by the Allen-Cahn equation. In the limit of vanishing interface width, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that the phase-field model reduces to the sharp-interface model with all the relevant transmission conditions on the moving interface. An energy estimate is derived, which suggests that for the diffusion-dominated regime, energy always decreases with time. However, this is not trivial in the case of other regimes. Through numerical examples, we analyze the efficiency of the developed phase-field formulation in modeling the evaporation process. We observe that our formulation is able to capture shrinking liquid droplet, in other words evaporation. Further, the phase-field model is upscaled to the Darcy scale using periodic homogenization for the diffusion-dominated regime. The effective parameters at the Darcy scale are connected to the pore scale through corresponding cell problems.</description>

      <title>Deep-water and shallow-water limits of the intermediate long wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the low regularity convergence problem for the intermediate long wave equation (ILW), with respect to the depth parameter $\delta&gt;0$, on the real line and the circle. As a natural bridge between the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and the Benjamin-Ono (BO) equations, the ILW equation is of physical interest. We prove that the solutions of ILW converge in the $H^s$-Sobolev space for $s&gt;\frac12$, to those of BO in the deep-water limit (as $\delta\to\infty$), and to those of KdV in the shallow-water limit (as $\delta\to 0$). This improves previous convergence results by Abdelouhab, Bona, Felland, and Saut (1989), which required $s&gt;\frac32$ in the deep-water limit and $s\geq2$ in the shallow-water limit. Moreover, the convergence results also apply to the generalised ILW equation, i.e.~with nonlinearity $\partial_x (u^k)$ for $k\geq 2$. Furthermore, this work gives the first convergence results of generalised ILW solutions on the circle with regularity $s\geq \frac34$. Overall, this study provides mathematical insights for the behaviour of the ILW equation and its solutions in different water depths, and has implications for predicting and modelling wave behaviour in various environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inverse dynamic problem for the Dirac system on finite metric tree graphs. Our main goal is to recover the topology (connectivity) of a tree, lengths of edges, and a matrix potential function on each edge. We use the dynamic response operator as our inverse data and apply the Leaf peeling method. In addition, we present a new dynamic algorithm to solve the forward problem for the Dirac system on general finite metric graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cauchy-Problem for 2D and 3D nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-vanishing conditions at infinity is investigated. Local well-posedness in the energy space for energy-subcritical nonlinearities merely satisfying Kato-type assumptions is proven. Our result provides the analogue of the well-established local $H^1$-theory for solutions vanishing at infinity, no further regularity assumptions on the nonlinearity are given. Global well-posedness is shown for defocusing nonlinearities provided that the nonlinear potential is non-negative. In addition, we also introduce global well-posedness in 3D for a class of nonlinearities for which the Hamiltonian energy fails to be sign-definite such as e.g. competing focusing-defocusing nonlinearities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an inverse problem of determining a time-dependent damping coefficient and potential appearing in the wave equation in a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension three or higher. More specifically, we are concerned with the case of conformally transversally anisotropic manifolds, or in other words, compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary conformally embedded in a product of the Euclidean line and a transversal manifold. With an additional assumption of the attenuated geodesic ray transform being injective on the transversal manifold, we prove that the knowledge of a certain partial Cauchy data set determines time-dependent damping coefficient and potential uniquely.</description>

      <title>The analysis of vertex feedback stabilisability of a star-shaped network of fluid-conveying pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an outstanding problem whether a pipe-flow system on a star-shaped network is stabilisable by a feedback control on the common vertex. In the present paper we deal with this problem. In particular, we study the equation governing the small vibrations of a stretched elastic pipe conveying fluid in a star-shaped network and examine the question of vertex feedback stabilisability of such a system via control moments. Finding an answer to the question is not straightforward, for the system operator associated with the corresponding closed-loop system is unbounded and nonselfadjoint. An approach to the study of the stabilisation problem for the closed-loop system is presented based on the spectral approach previously introduced by the authors for star graphs of stretched elastic beams. When the tension in the pipes is greater than the square of the fluid-flow velocity, we establish a positive result that in fact gives the strong property of uniform exponential stability of the closed-loop system.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the defocusing energy-critical stochastic nonlinear wave equations (SNLW) with an additive stochastic forcing on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ with $d \geq 3$. By adapting the probabilistic perturbation argument employed in the context of the random data Cauchy theory by B\'enyi-Oh-Pocovnicu (2015) and Pocovnicu (2017) and in the context of stochastic PDEs by Oh-Okamoto (2020), we prove global well-posedness of the defocusing energy-critical SNLW. In particular, on $\mathbb{T}^d$, we prove global well-posedness with the stochastic forcing below the energy space.</description>

Abstract: We collect several results concerning regularity of minimal laminations, and governing the various modes of convergence for sequences of minimal laminations. We then apply this theory to prove that a function has locally least gradient (is $1$-harmonic) iff its level sets are a minimal lamination; this resolves an open problem of Daskalopoulos and Uhlenbeck.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the intricacies of boundary stabilization for the Linearized KP-II Equation within the constraints of a bounded domain. Our primary aim is to engineer a parameterized set of feedback laws that not only lead to the existence of solutions originating from small enough initial data but also facilitate their uniform exponential decay within the energy space. As far as we know, the present work is the first result on boundary feedback stabilization related to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II equation posed in a rectangle $\Omega=(0,L)\times (0,L)$, $L&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz quasi-resonances are unstable under most single-signed perturbations of the wave speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Helmholtz problems with a perturbed wave speed, where the single-signed perturbation is linear in a parameter $z$. Both the wave speed and the perturbation are allowed to be discontinuous (modelling a penetrable obstacle). We show that there exists a polynomial function of frequency such that, for any frequency, for most values of $z$, the norm of the solution operator is bounded by that function.
  This solution-operator bound is most interesting for Helmholtz problems with strong trapping; recall that here there exists a sequence of real frequencies, tending to infinity, through which the solution operator grows superalgebraically, with these frequencies often called $\textit{quasi-resonances}$. The result of this paper then shows that, at every fixed frequency in the quasi-resonance, the norm of the solution operator becomes much smaller for most single-signed perturbations of the wave speed, i.e., quasi-resonances are unstable under most such perturbations.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions for the inverse mean curvature flow in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF) in the Heisenberg group $(\He^n, d_\varepsilon)$, where $d_\varepsilon$ is distance associated to either $| \cdot |_\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the natural family of left-invariant Riemannian metrics, or with their sub-Riemannian counterparts for $\varepsilon=0$. For $\Omega \subseteq \He^n$ an open set with smooth boundary $\Sigma_0=\partial \Omega$ satisfying a uniform exterior gauge-ball condition and bounded complement we show existence of a global weak IMCF of generalized hypersurfaces $\{\Sigma^\varepsilon_s\}_{s \geq 0} \subseteq \mathbb{H}^n$ which is proper. Here, both in the Riemannian and in the sub-Riemannian setting, we adopt the weak formulation introduced by Huisken and Ilmanen in \cite{HuiskenIlmanen}, following the approach in \cite{Moser} due to Moser and based on the the link between IMCF and $p$-harmonic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the indirect signal production system with nonlinear transmission is considered \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} &amp; u_t = \Delta u-\nabla\cdot(u \nabla v), \\ \displaystyle &amp; v_t =\Delta v-v+w,\\ \displaystyle &amp; w_t =\Delta w-w+ f(u) \end{array} \right. \] in a bounded smooth domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ associated with homogenous Neumann boundary conditions, where $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ satisfies $0\le f(s) \le s^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha&gt;0$. It is known that the system possesses a global bounded solution if $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac 4n$ when $n\ge 4$. In the case $n\le 3$ and if we consider superlinear transmission, no regularity of $w$ or $v$ can be derived directly. In this work, we show that if $0&lt;\alpha&lt; \min\{\frac 4n,1+\frac 2n\}$, the solution is global and bounded via an approach based on the maximal Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limit of particle systems with absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider one-dimensional particles interacting in mean-field type through a bounded kernel. In addition, when particles hit some barrier (say zero), they are removed from the system. This absorption of particles is instantaneously felt by the others, as, contrary to the usual mean-field setting, particles interact only with other non-absorbed particles. This makes the interaction singular as it happens through hitting times of the given barrier. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of each particle is non uniformly elliptic. We show that the particle system admits a weak solution. Through Partial Girsanov transforms we are able to relate our particles with independent stopped Brownian motions, and prove tightness and convergence to a mean-fied limit stochastic differential equation when the number of particles tends to infinity. Further, we study the limit and establish the existence and uniqueness of the classical solution to the corresponding nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation under some continuity assumption on the interacting kernel. This yields the strong well-posedness of the mean-field limit SDE and confirms that our convergence result is indeed a propagation of chaos result.</description>
