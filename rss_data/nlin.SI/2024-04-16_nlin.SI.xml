      <title>Bosonic construction of CKP tau function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CKP tau function has been an important topic in mathematical physics. In this paper, the inverse of vacuum expectation value of exponential of certain bosonic fields, is showed to be the CKP tau function given by Chang and Wu, in the language of CKP Darboux transformation. In fact, computation of the above vacuum expectation value is usually quite difficult, since the square of bosonic fields is usually not zero. Here the corresponding vacuum expectation value is understood as successive application of CKP Darboux transformations, so that we can compute it by using the methods of integrable systems, where a useful formula is given. For applications, we construct solutions of KdV hierarchy by vacuum expectation value of bosonic fields, by the fact that KdV hierarchy is the 2-reduction of CKP hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Lax structure and tau function for large BKP hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly investigate Lax structure and tau function for the large BKP hierarchy, which is also known as Toda hierarchy of B type, or Hirota--Ohta--coupled KP hierarchy, or Pfaff lattice. Firstly, the large BKP hierarchy can be derived from fermionic BKP hierarchy by using a special bosonization, which is presented in the form of bilinear equation. Then from bilinear equation, the corresponding Lax equation is given, where in particular the relation of flow generator with Lax operator is obtained. Also starting from Lax equation, the corresponding bilinear equation and existence of tau function are discussed. After that, large BKP hierarchy is viewed as sub--hierarchy of modified Toda (mToda) hierarchy, also called two--component first modified KP hierarchy. Finally by using two basic Miura transformations from mToda to Toda, we understand two typical relations between large BKP tau function $\tau_n(\mathbf{t})$ and Toda tau function $\tau_n^{\rm Toda}(\mathbf{t},-\mathbf{t})$, that is, $\tau_n^{{\rm Toda}}(\mathbf{t},-{\mathbf{t}})=\tau_n(\mathbf{t})\tau_{n-1}(\mathbf{t})$ and $\tau_n^{{\rm Toda}}(\mathbf{t},-{\mathbf{t}})=\tau_n^2(\mathbf{t})$. Further we find $\big(\tau_n(\mathbf{t})\tau_{n-1}(\mathbf{t}),\tau_n^2(\mathbf{t})\big)$ satisfies bilinear equation of mToda hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Field method approach in the factorization of nonlinear second order differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the general solution of second-order nonlinear differential equations of Lienard type is obtained within the nonlinear factorization method of Rosu and Cornejo-Perez by the so-called field method approach. This method is based on writing the factorization conditions in the dynamical systems form and requires to assume that the intermediate function Phi that occurs in the factorization be dependent not only on the dependent variable of the nonlinear equation, but also on the independent variable. The method is applied to several cases of Lienard type equations which are written in a commutative factorization form and their general solutions are obtained by solving Bernoulli differential equations.</description>

      <title>Interpolating supersymmetric pair of Fokker-Planck equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Fokker-Planck equations that interpolate a pair of supersymmetrically related Fokker-Planck equations with constant coefficients. Based on the interesting property of shape-invariance, various one-parameter interpolations of the solutions of the supersymmetric pair of Fokker-Planck systems can be directly constructed.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian hierarchies of compatible maps, associated integrable difference systems and Yang-Baxter maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two non-equivalent families of hierarchies of non-Abelian compatible maps and we provide their Lax pair formulation. These maps are associated with families of hierarchies of non-Abelian Yang-Baxter maps, which we provide explicitly. In addition, these hierarchies correspond to integrable difference systems with variables defined on edges of an elementary cell of the $\mathbb{Z}^2$ graph, that in turn lead to hierarchies of difference systems with variables defined on vertices of the same cell. In that respect we obtain the non-Abelian lattice-modified Gel'fand-Dikii hierarchy, together with the explicit form of a non-Abelian hierarchy that we refer to as the lattice-NQC (or lattice-$(Q3)_0$) Gel'fand-Dikii hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Large-space and long-time asymptotic behaviors of $N_{\infty}$-soliton solutions (soliton gas) for the focusing Hirota equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hirota equation is one of the integrable higher-order extensions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, and can describe the ultra-short optical pulse propagation in the form $iq_t+\alpha(q_{xx}+ 2|q|^2q)+i\beta (q_{xxx}+ 6|q|^2q_x)=0,\, (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}^2\, (\alpha,\,\beta\in\mathbb{R})$. In this paper, we analytically explore the asymptotic behaviors of a soliton gas for the Hirota equation including the complex modified KdV equation, in which the soliton gas is regarded as the limit $N\to \infty$ of $N$-soliton solutions, and characterized using the Riemann-Hilbert problem with discrete spectra restricted in the intervals $(ia, ib)\cup (-ib, -ia)\, (0&lt;a&lt;b)$. We find that this soliton gas tends slowly to the Jaocbian elliptic wave solution with an error $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-1})$ (zero exponentially quickly ) as $x\to -\infty$ ($x\to +\infty$). We also present the long-time asymptotics of the soliton gas under the different velocity conditions: $x/t&gt;4\beta b^2,\, \xi_c&lt;x/t&lt;4\beta b^2,\, x/t&lt;\xi_c$. Moreover, we analyze the property of the soliton gas for the case of the discrete spectra filling uniformly a quadrature domain.</description>

      <title>Singularities and growth of higher order discrete equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the link between the degree growth of integrable birational mappings of order higher than two and their singularity structures. The higher order mappings we use in this study are all obtained by coupling mappings that are integrable through spectral methods, typically belonging to the QRT family, to a variety of linearisable ones. We show that by judiciously choosing these linearisable mappings, it is possible to obtain higher order mappings that exhibit the maximal degree growth compatible with integrability, i.e. for which the degree grows as a polynomial of order equal to the order of the mapping. In all the cases we analysed, we found that maximal degree growth was associated with the existence of an unconfining singularity pattern. Several cases with submaximal growth but which still possess unconfining singularity patterns are also presented. In many cases the exact degrees of the iterates of the mappings were obtained by applying a method due to Halburd, based on the preimages of specific values that appear in the singularity patterns of the mapping, but we also present some examples where such a calculation appears to be impossible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article introduces contact germs that transform solutions of some partial differential equations into solutions of other equations. Parametric symmetries of differential equations generalizing point and contact symmetries are defined. New transformations and symmetries may depend on derivatives of arbitrary but finite order. The stationary Schr\"odinger equations, acoustics and gas dynamics equations are considered as examples.</description>
