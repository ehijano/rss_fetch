      <title>An oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism for tides</title>

Abstract: Tides represent the daily alternations of high and low waters along coastlines and in oceans, and the current theory (termed the gravitational forcing mechanism) explains them as a manifestation of the response of ocean water to the Moon's (Sun's) gravitational force. However, although the purely hydrodynamic models representing the current theory have been widely tested over global ocean,their tidal elevation accuracies are generally low. This implies an uncertainty as to whether the gravitational forcing mechanism is the best explanation for tides. In this study, we present a new theory (termed the oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism), in which tides are explained as a manifestation of oscillating ocean basin that is intricately linked to the elongated spinning solid Earth due to the Moon (Sun). Based on this new theory, we develop an algebraic tide model and test it using 11-year observations from 33 bottom pressure stations over the Pacific Ocean, the average Root Mean Square (RMS) deviation of tidal elevation predicted by this model against observation is 7.54 cm. Using a ratio of M2 elevation RMS of ocean tide model EOT11a and its total tidal elevation RMS as a reference, we estimate the total tidal elevation RMS of six purely hydrodynamic models (i.e.,Hallberg Isopycnal Model, OSU Tidal Inversion software-GN ,STORMTIDE model, OSU Tidal Inversion Software-ERB,STM-1B, and HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model to be 59.93, 51.64, 57.05, 38.56, 86.92, and 53.56 cm, respectively.</description>

      <title>The fluid dynamics of liquid mushrooms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets that impact the surface of a deep liquid pool may form a vertical jet after the cavity formation event, provided they have sufficient impact energy. Depending on the associated time scales and the effect of the Rayleigh Plateau instability, this jet may either continue to rise, or may form satellite droplets via necking. Collision of these structures with a second incoming droplet, ejected from the same dispensing tip as the first droplet, may result in the formation of various lamellar patterns, depending on the impact conditions, giving rise to liquid mushroom and or umbrella structures. In this research, we experiment for the first time with hydrodynamics of such liquid mushrooms, and study the effect of droplet impact height, surface tension, and viscosity on the dynamics of such lamellar formations. We further explore the role of the orientation of incoming droplet impact, ie whether head on or offset collision with the rising jet or satellite droplet. We discuss the spatiotemporal evolution of the lamella diameters, and its susceptibility to surface tension, viscosity, and droplet impact height. We put forward a theoretical model based on energetics, to predict the maximum spread diameter of the lamellae, which yields accurate predictions with respect to our experiments. Our findings may help to provide important insights towards a fluid dynamic phenomenon observed often in nature and may be important in niche utilities as well.</description>
