      <title>The exponential Teichm\"uller theory: Ahlfors--Hopf differentials and diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22667v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider minimisers of the $p$-exponential conformal energy for homeomorphisms $f:R \to S$ of finite distortion $\IK(z,f)$ between analytically finite Riemann surfaces in a fixed homotopy class $[f_0]$,\[ \mE_p(f:R,S)=\int_R \exp(p\IK(z,f))\; d\sigma(z). \] Homeomorphic minimisers exist should the barrier be a homeomorphism of finite energy, $\mE_p(f_0,R,S)&lt;\infty$. In general this problem is not variational, however the Euler-Lagrange equations show the inverses $h=f^{-1}$ of sufficiently regular stationary solutions have an associated holomorphic quadratic differential -- the Ahlfors-Hopf differential, \[\Phi=\exp(p\IK(w,h))\,h_w\overline{h_\wbar}\,d\sigma_R(h). \] From the Riemann-Roch theorem and an approximation technique, we show the variational equations hold for extremal mappings. We take this as a starting point for higher regularity to show that if $h:\Omega\to\tilde{\Omega}$ is a Sobolev homeomorphism between planar domains with holomorphic Ahlfors-Hopf differential, then $h$ is a diffeomorphism. It will follow that $h$ is harmonic in a metric induced by its own (smooth) distortion. We develop equations for the Beltrami coefficient of $h$, establishing a connection between degenerate elliptic non-linear Beltrami equations and these harmonic mappings. On the surface we conclude that minimisers $f_p\in [f_0]$ of $\mE_p(f:R,S)$ are diffeomorphisms and are unique stationary points. This now links two different approaches to Teichm\"uller theory; the classical theory of extremal quasiconformal maps and the harmonic mapping theory. As $p\to\infty$ we show $f_p\to f_\infty$ to recover the unique extremal quasiconformal mapping . This extremal quasiconformal mapping is not a diffeomorphism (unless it is conformal) and $f_p$ degenerates on a divisor. As $p\to0$ we recover the harmonic diffeomorphism in $[f_0]$ and Shoen-Yau's results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have established various criteria for the topological transitivity of families of continuous (holomorphic) functions. Furthermore, by leveraging the properties of expanding families of meromorphic functions, we offer an alternative proof of Montel's three point theorem.</description>

      <title>Summability for State Integrals of hyperbolic knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove conjectures of Garoufalidis-Gu-Mari\~no that perturbative series associated with the hyperbolic knots $4_1$ and $5_2$ are resurgent and Borel summable. In the process, we give an algorithm that can be used to explicitly compute the Borel-Laplace resummation as a combination of state integrals of Andersen-Kashaev. This gives a complete description of the resurgent structure in these examples and allows for explicit computations of Stokes constants.</description>

      <title>Real-valued spectral shift functions for contractions and dissipative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent joint papers the authors of this note solved a famous problem remained open for many years and proved that for arbitrary contractions with trace class difference there exists an integrable spectral shift function, for which an analogue of the Lifshits--Krein trace formula holds. Similar results were also obtained for pairs of dissipative operators. Note that in contrast with the case of self-adjoint and unitary operators it may happen that there is no {\it real-valued} integrable spectral shift function. In this note we announce results that give sufficient conditions for the existence of an integrable real-valued spectral shift function in the case of pairs of contractions. We also consider the case of pairs of dissipative operators.</description>

      <title>Formulations of Furstenberg's $\times 2 \times 3$ conjecture in complex analysis and operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Furstenberg's $\times 2 \times 3$ conjecture has remained a central open problem in ergodic theory for over $50$ years, and it serves as the basic test case for a broad class of rigidity phenomena which are believed to hold in number-theoretic dynamics. More recently, two related statements have appeared in the literature: a question about periodic approximation raised by Levit and Vigdorovich in the context of approximate group theory and a periodic equidistribution conjecture formulated by Lindenstrauss. The purpose of this article is to provide equivalent formulations for these three statements in a complex-analytic setting and an operator-algebraic setting, giving nine conjectures grouped into three triples. The complex-analytic conjectures involve so-called Carath\'{e}odory functions on the unit disk that satisfy a certain functional identity, and we find that Furstenberg's conjecture is equivalent to the assertion that every such function is a convex combination of rational functions. The operator-algebraic conjectures involve tracial states on the full group $C^\ast$-algebra of a certain semidirect product, which is related to Baumslag-Solitar groups.</description>

      <title>Endpoint estimates and sparse domination in nonhomogeneous trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove endpoint and sparse-like bounds for Bergman projectors on nonhomogeneous, radial trees $X$ that model manifolds with possibly unbounded geometry. The natural Bergman measures on $X$ may fail to be doubling, and even locally doubling, with respect to the right metric in our setting. Weighted consequences of our sparse domination results are also considered, and are in line with the known results in the disk. Our endpoint results are partly a consequence of a new Calder\'on-Zygmund theory for discrete, non-locally doubling metric spaces.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on families of Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a one-parameter family of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties such that the central fibre admits a unique K\"ahler-Einstein metric, we provide an analytic method to show that the neighboring fibre admits a unique K\"ahler-Einstein metric. Our results go beyond by establishing uniform a priori estimates on the K\"ahler-Einstein potentials along fully degenerate families of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In addition, we show the continuous variation of these K\"ahler-Einstein currents, and establish uniform Moser-Trudinger inequalities and uniform coercivity of the Ding functionals. Central to our article is introducing and studying a notion of convergence for quasi-plurisubharmonic functions within families of normal K\"ahler varieties. We show that the Monge-Amp\`ere energy is upper semi-continuous with respect to this topology, and we establish a Demailly-Koll\'ar result for functions with full Monge-Amp\`ere mass.</description>

      <title>Eremenko's conjecture, wandering Lakes of Wada, and maverick points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10256v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general technique for realising full closed subsets of the complex plane as wandering sets of entire functions. Using this construction, we solve a number of open problems.
  (1) We construct a counterexample to Eremenko's conjecture, a central problem in transcendental dynamics that asks whether every connected component of the set of escaping points of a transcendental entire function is unbounded.
  (2) We prove that there is a transcendental entire function for which infinitely many Fatou components share the same boundary. This resolves the long-standing problem whether "Lakes of Wada continua" can arise in complex dynamics, and answers the analogue of a question of Fatou from 1920 concerning Fatou components of rational functions.
  (3) We answer a question of Rippon concerning the existence of non-escaping points on the boundary of a bounded escaping wandering domain, that is, a wandering Fatou component contained in the escaping set. In fact we show that the set of such points can have positive Lebesgue measure.
  (4) We give the first example of an entire function having a simply connected Fatou component whose closure has a disconnected complement, answering a question of Boc Thaler.
  In view of (3), we introduce the concept of "maverick points": points on the boundary of a wandering domain whose accumulation behaviour differs from that of internal points. We prove that the set of such points has harmonic measure zero, but that it can nonetheless be rather large. For example, it may have positive planar Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal measures, polymer partition functions, and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the study of a particular class of biorthogonal measures, encompassing at the same time several random matrix models and partition functions of polymers. This general framework allows us to characterize the partition functions of the Log Gamma polymer and the mixed polymer in terms of explicit biorthogonal measures, as it was previously done for the homogeneous O'Connell-Yor polymer by Imamura and Sasamoto. In addition, we show that the biorthogonal measures associated to these three polymer models (Log Gamma, O'Connell-Yor, and mixed polymer) converge to random matrix eigenvalue distributions in small temperature limits. We also clarify the connection between different Fredholm determinant representations and explain how our results might be useful for asymptotic analysis and large deviation estimates.</description>

      <title>A Non-Archimedean Second Main Theorem for Hypersurfaces in Subgeneral Position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply an idea of Levin to obtain a non-truncated second main theorem for non-Archimedean analytic maps approximating algebraic hypersurfaces in subgeneral position. In some cases, for example when all the hypersurfaces are non-linear and all the intersections are transverse, this improves an inequality of Quang, whose inequality is sharp for the case of hyperplanes in subgeneral position.</description>
