      <title>TSPC-PFD: TSPC-Based Low-Power High-Resolution CMOS Phase Frequency Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase Frequency Detectors (PFDs) are essential components in Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) and Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) systems, responsible for comparing phase and frequency differences and generating up/down signals to regulate charge pumps and/or, consequently, Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCOs). Conventional PFD designs often suffer from significant dead zones and blind zones, which degrade phase detection accuracy and increase jitter in high-speed applications. This paper addresses PFD design challenges and presents a novel low-power True Single-Phase Clock (TSPC)-based PFD. The proposed design eliminates the blind zone entirely while achieving a minimal dead zone of 40 ps. The proposed PFD, implemented using TSMC 28 nm technology, demonstrates a low-power consumption of 4.41 uW at 3 GHz input frequency with a layout area of $10.42\mu m^2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization for the Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and Pickup and Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and Pickup and Delivery, an advanced and practical extension of classical routing models. This variant integrates the characteristics of the Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with time-window constraints, pickup and delivery operations and vehicle capacity limitations. These features closely mirror the complexities of contemporary logistics challenges, including last-mile distribution, reverse logistics and on-demand service scenarios. To tackle the inherent computational difficulties of this NP-hard problem, we propose two specialized mathematical formulations: an arc-based model and a node-oriented model, each designed to capture distinct structural aspects of the problem. Both models are implemented on D-Wave's LeapCQMHybrid platform, which combines quantum and classical techniques for solving constrained optimization tasks. We further introduce a preprocessing reduction method that eliminates redundant arcs, significantly enhancing computational performance and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that hybrid quantum approaches are capable of solving problem instances of realistic size, underscoring their potential as a transformative tool for next-generation routing optimization.</description>

      <title>SOT-MRAM Bitcell Scaling with BEOL Read Selectors: A DTCO Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the cross-node scaling potential of SOT-MRAM for last-level caches (LLCs) under heterogeneous system scaling paradigm. We perform extensive Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) exercises to evaluate the bitcell footprint for different cell configurations at a representative 7 nm technology and to assess their implications on read and write power-performance. We crucially identify the MTJ routing struggle in conventional two-transistor one-resistor (2T1R) SOT-MRAMs as the primary bitcell area scaling challenge and propose to use BEOL read selectors (BEOL RSs) that enable (10 -- 40) % bitcell area reduction and eventually match sub-N3 SRAM. On writability, we affirm that BEOL RS-based bitcells could meet the required SOT switching current, provided the magnetic free layer properties be engineered in line with LLC-specific, (0.1 -- 100) s retention targets. This is particularly to attribute to their (i) more available Si fins for write transistor and (ii) lower bitline resistance at reduced cell width. We nevertheless underscore the read tradeoff associated with BEOL RSs, with the low-drive IGZO-FET selector sacrificing the latency up to (3 -- 5) ns and the imperfectly rectifying diode selectors suffering (2.5 -- 5)$\times$ energy cost relative to 2T1R. This article thus highlights the realistic prospects and hurdles of BEOL RSs towards holistic power-performance-area scaling of SOT-MRAM.</description>

      <title>Making AI Inevitable: Historical Perspective and the Problems of Predicting Long-Term Technological Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the extent to which prominent debates about the future of AI are best understood as subjective, philosophical disagreements over the history and future of technological change rather than as objective, material disagreements over the technologies themselves. It focuses on the deep disagreements over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) will prove transformative for human society; a question that is analytically prior to that of whether this transformative effect will help or harm humanity. The study begins by distinguishing two fundamental camps in this debate. The first of these can be identified as "transformationalists," who argue that continued AI development will inevitably have a profound effect on society. Opposed to them are "skeptics," a more eclectic group united by their disbelief that AI can or will live up to such high expectations. Each camp admits further "strong" and "weak" variants depending on their tolerance for epistemic risk. These stylized contrasts help to identify a set of fundamental questions that shape the camps' respective interpretations of the future of AI. Three questions in particular are focused on: the possibility of non-biological intelligence, the appropriate time frame of technological predictions, and the assumed trajectory of technological development. In highlighting these specific points of non-technical disagreement, this study demonstrates the wide range of different arguments used to justify either the transformationalist or skeptical position. At the same time, it highlights the strong argumentative burden of the transformationalist position, the way that belief in this position creates competitive pressures to achieve first-mover advantage, and the need to widen the concept of "expertise" in debates surrounding the future development of AI.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Simulation for Advection-Diffusion Equation with arbitrary transport field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to solve the advection-diffusion equation under arbitrary transporting fields using a quantum-inspired 'Schrodingerisation' technique for Hamiltonian simulation. Although numerous methods exist for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), Hamiltonian simulation remains a relatively underexplored yet promising direction-particularly in the context of long-term, fault-tolerant quantum computing. Building on this potential, our quantum algorithm is designed to accommodate non-trivial, spatially varying transport fields and is applicable to both 2D and 3D advection-diffusion problems. To ensure numerical stability and accuracy, the algorithm combines an upwinding discretization scheme for the advective component and the central differencing for diffusion, adapted for quantum implementation through a tailored mix of approximation and optimization techniques. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on benchmark scenarios involving coupled rotational, shear, and diffusive transport in two and three dimensions. Additionally, we implement the 2D advection-diffusion equation using 16 qubits on IBM Quantum hardware, validating our method and highlighting its practical applicability and robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroscientists face challenges in analyzing high-dimensional neural recording data of dense functional networks. Without ground-truth reference data, finding the best algorithm for recovering neurologically relevant networks remains an open question. We implemented hybrid quantum algorithms to construct functional networks and compared them with the results of documented classical techniques. We demonstrated that our quantum state fidelity can provide a competitive alternative to classical metrics by revealing distinct functional networks. Our results suggest that quantum computing offers a viable and potentially advantageous alternative for data-driven modeling in neuroscience, underscoring its broader applicability in high-dimensional graph inference and complex system analysis.</description>

      <title>MetaFed: Advancing Privacy, Performance, and Sustainability in Federated Metaverse Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of immersive Metaverse applications introduces complex challenges at the intersection of performance, privacy, and environmental sustainability. Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25\% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Programmable k-local Ising Machines and all-optical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks on Photonic Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unify k-local Ising optimization and optical KAN function learning on a single photonic platform, establishing a critical convergence point in optical computing that enables interleaved discrete-continuous workflows. We introduce a single spacial light modulator (SLM)-centric primitive that realizes, in one stroke, all-optical k-local Ising interactions and fully optical Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) layers. The central idea is to convert structural nonlinearity of a nominally linear photonic scatterer into a per-window computational resource by adding one relay pass through the same spatial light modulator. A folded 4f relay reimages the first Fourier plane onto the SLM so that each chosen spin clique or ridge channel occupies a disjoint window with its own second-pass phase patch. Propagation remains linear in the optical field, yet the measured intensity in each window becomes a freely programmable polynomial of the clique sum or projection amplitude. This yields native, per-clique k-local couplings without nonlinear media and, in parallel, the many independent univariate nonlinearities required by KAN layers, all with in-situ physical gradients for training using two-frame (forward and adjoint) physical gradients. We outline implementation on spatial photonic Ising machines, injection-locked VCSEL arrays, and the Microsoft analog optical computers. In all cases the hardware change is one extra lens and a fold (or an on-chip 4f loop), enabling a minimal overhead, massively parallel route to high-order optical Ising optimization and trainable, all-optical KAN processing.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>

      <title>PRZK-Bind: A Physically Rooted Zero-Knowledge Authentication Protocol for Secure Digital Twin Binding in Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology is rapidly becoming essential for smart city ecosystems, enabling real-time synchronisation and autonomous decision-making across physical and digital domains. However, as DTs take active roles in control loops, securely binding them to their physical counterparts in dynamic and adversarial environments remains a significant challenge. Existing authentication solutions either rely on static trust models, require centralised authorities, or fail to provide live and verifiable physical-digital binding, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and distributed deployments. To address this gap, we introduce PRZK-Bind, a lightweight and decentralised authentication protocol that combines Schnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs with elliptic curve cryptography to establish secure, real-time correspondence between physical entities and DTs without relying on pre-shared secrets. Simulation results show that PRZK-Bind significantly improves performance, offering up to 4.5 times lower latency and 4 times reduced energy consumption compared to cryptography-heavy baselines, while maintaining false acceptance rates more than 10 times lower. These findings highlight its suitability for future smart city deployments requiring efficient, resilient, and trustworthy DT authentication.</description>

      <title>AQ-PCDSys: An Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System for Autonomous Space Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous planetary exploration missions are critically dependent on real-time, accurate environmental perception for navigation and hazard avoidance. However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18155v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected systems in modern vehicles not only introduced a new era of convenience, automation, and connected vehicles but also elevated their exposure to sophisticated cyber threats. This is especially evident in US and Canada, where cyber-enabled auto theft has surged in recent years, revealing the limitations of existing security measures for connected vehicles. In response, this paper proposes $AutoGuardX$, a comprehensive cybersecurity framework designed specifically for connected vehicles. $AutoGuardX$ combines key elements from existing recognized standards for vehicle security, such as ISO/SAE 21434 and ISO 26262, with advanced technologies, including machine learning-based anomaly detection, IoT security protocols, and encrypted communication channels. The framework addresses major attack vectors like relay attacks, controller area network (CAN) bus intrusions, and vulnerabilities introduced by emerging technologies such as 5G and quantum computing. $AutoGuardX$ is extensively evaluated through security simulations across a mix of Sedans and SUVs from four major vehicle brands manufactured between 2019 and 2023. The results demonstrate the framework's adaptability, scalability, and practical effectiveness against existing and emerging threats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a link between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, laying the groundwork for GNNs to approximate solutions for these computationally challenging tasks. By analyzing the sensitivity of QUBO formulations, we frame the solution of QUBO problems as a heterophilic node classification task. We then propose QUBO-GNN, an architecture that integrates graph representation learning techniques with QUBO-aware features to approximate solutions efficiently. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised data generation mechanism to enable efficient and scalable training data acquisition even for large-scale QUBO instances. Experimental evaluations of QUBO-GNN across diverse QUBO problem sizes demonstrate its superior performance compared to exhaustive search and heuristic methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges in the emerging intersection between QUBO optimization and GNN-based learning.</description>

Abstract: A multi-agent AI system (MAS) is composed of multiple autonomous agents that interact, exchange information, and make decisions based on internal generative models. Recent advances in large language models and tool-using agents have made MAS increasingly practical in areas like scientific discovery and collaborative automation. However, key questions remain: When are MAS more effective than single-agent systems? What new safety risks arise from agent interactions? And how should we evaluate their reliability and structure? This paper outlines a formal framework for analyzing MAS, focusing on two core aspects: effectiveness and safety. We explore whether MAS truly improve robustness, adaptability, and performance, or merely repackage known techniques like ensemble learning. We also study how inter-agent dynamics may amplify or suppress system vulnerabilities. While MAS are relatively new to the signal processing community, we envision them as a powerful abstraction that extends classical tools like distributed estimation and sensor fusion to higher-level, policy-driven inference. Through experiments on data science automation, we highlight the potential of MAS to reshape how signal processing systems are designed and trusted.</description>
