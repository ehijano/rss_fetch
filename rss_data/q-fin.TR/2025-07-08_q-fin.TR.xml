      <title>Does Overnight News Explain Overnight Returns?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 30 years, nearly all the gains in the U.S. stock market have been earned overnight, while average intraday returns have been negative or flat. We find that a large part of this effect can be explained through features of intraday and overnight news. Our analysis uses a collection of 2.4 million news articles. We apply a novel technique for supervised topic analysis that selects news topics based on their ability to explain contemporaneous market returns. We find that time variation in the prevalence of news topics and differences in the responses to news topics both contribute to the difference in intraday and overnight returns. In out-of-sample tests, our approach forecasts which stocks will do particularly well overnight and particularly poorly intraday. Our approach also helps explain patterns of continuation and reversal in intraday and overnight returns. We contrast the effect of news with other mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain overnight returns.</description>

      <title>Chronologically Consistent Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in social sciences, but their training data can introduce lookahead bias and training leakage. A good chronologically consistent language model requires efficient use of training data to maintain accuracy despite time-restricted data. Here, we overcome this challenge by training a suite of chronologically consistent large language models, ChronoBERT and ChronoGPT, which incorporate only the text data that would have been available at each point in time. Despite this strict temporal constraint, our models achieve strong performance on natural language processing benchmarks, outperforming or matching widely used models (e.g., BERT), and remain competitive with larger open-weight models. Lookahead bias is model and application-specific because even if a chronologically consistent language model has poorer language comprehension, a regression or prediction model applied on top of the language model can compensate. In an asset pricing application predicting next-day stock returns from financial news, we find that ChronoBERT and ChronoGPT's real-time outputs achieve Sharpe ratios comparable to a much larger Llama model, indicating that lookahead bias is modest. Our results demonstrate a scalable, practical framework to mitigate training leakage, ensuring more credible backtests and predictions across finance and other social science domains.</description>
