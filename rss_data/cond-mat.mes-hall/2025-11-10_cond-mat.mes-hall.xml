      <title>Twistraintronics in Square Moire Superlattices of Stacked Graphene Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first observation of controlled, strain-induced square moire patterns in stacked graphene. By selectively displacing native wrinkles, we drive a reversible transition from the usual trigonal to square moire order. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals elliptically shaped AA domains, while spectroscopy shows strong electronic correlation in the form of narrow bands with split Van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. A continuum model with electrostatic interactions reproduces these features under the specific twist-strain combination that minimizes elastic energy. This work demonstrates that the combination of twist and strain, or twistraintronics, enables the realization of highly correlated electronic states in moire heterostructures with geometries that were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics-induced breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator. By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of the Magnetic Monopole Field in a 3D Artificial Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, long hypothesised as fundamental particles carrying isolated magnetic charge, emerge in spin-ice systems as fractionalised excitations governed by the ice rule. Yet their three-dimensional field structure has never been directly visualised. Here, we use two-photon lithography and processing to fabricate a fully three-dimensional artificial spin-ice lattice with diamond-bond geometry. We then use scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry to directly measure the stray magnetic fields of both charge-neutral and monopole vertices. We find that ice-rule vertices produce antivortex textures directly above their vertices, stabilised by the local frustrated two-in/two out ordering principle. Direct imaging of the monopole stray field shows a highly divergent profile. By correlating experiment with micromagnetic simulations and performing a multipole expansion of the reconstructed magnetisation, we reveal that monopoles in 3DASI are non-trivial micromagnetic entities, carrying both magnetic charge and an intrinsic moment, giving rise to anisotropic interactions that are dependent upon the quasiparticles position on the lattice. Results suggest that as monopoles separate under an applied field, the dipolar contribution to their interaction reorients relative to the underlying Coulombic field, revealing that monopole coupling is tunable through geometry, being set by the local vertex topology. These findings establish 3DASI as a programmable magnetic metamaterial in which nanoscale geometry governs the energetics and dynamics of emergent magnetic charges.</description>

      <title>In-Plane Field induced Quantized Longitudinal Conductivity in Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an in plane quantization (IPQ) state in trilayer magnetic topological insulators, characterized by a quantized longitudinal conductivity of e2/h under strong in-plane magnetic fields. This state emerges at a quantum critical point separating quantum anomalous Hall phases tuned by field angle and orientation, directly linking gap-closing behavior to quantized criticality. Temperature and gate dependent transport measurements, supported by a self consistent approximation model, reveal that electron hole puddles dominate charge transport in this regime, highlighting the essential role of impurity disorder in stabilizing quantized critical transport. These findings establish a tunable experimental framework that connects gap-closing physics with universal conductivity, offering both microscopic insight into critical transport in magnetic topological insulators and a robust platform for probing quantum criticality in topological systems.</description>

      <title>Ultimate photon entanglement in biexciton cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization entanglement of photons emitted by semiconductor quantum dots is unavoidably limited by the spin fluctuations of the host lattice nuclei. To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Unexpected increase of intensity-dependent excitonic second- and third-harmonic generation induced by static electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute and analyze the dependence of excitonic second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG) as a function of the optical excitation intensity in the presence of static electric fields by solving the semiconductor Bloch equations. Our simulations are performed for excitation of the strongly bound intralayer exciton of an inversion-symmetric homobilayer of MoS2 with in-plane electric fields. We demonstrate that for resonant excitation at the 1s K-exciton the SHG and the THG show complex dependencies on both the strength of the static field and the peak amplitude of the optical pulse. For sufficiently intense optical excitation, the THG increases and the SHG increases superlinearly with the amplitude of the static field as long as exciton ionization is not yet dominating. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that these dependencies arise from an interplay between several effects including static and transient Stark shifts, exciton ionization, Wannier-Stark localization, off-resonant Rabi oscillations, and a modified interference between optical nonlinearities induced by the intraband acceleration. Our findings offer several new possibilities for controlling the strong-field dynamics of systems with strongly bound excitons.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Spin Precession and Spin Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets hold great potential for spintronic applications, yet their intrinsic spin dynamics and associated transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin precession in real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the Hall voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor. The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Uncertainty-Governed Spin Dynamics in s-d Coupled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum fluctuation effects arising from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle governing angular momentum operators in the full dynamical evolution of disentanglement-entanglement-disentanglement between itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments under the s-d exchange interaction. Beyond the conventional deterministic spin-transfer torque, we identify an intrinsic channel for the transfer of spin quantum fluctuations. By extending the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to include both quantum and thermal stochastic fields, we reveal a temperature regime where quantum fluctuations dominate spin dynamics. Furthermore, voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy can exponentially amplify these quantum fluctuation signals, enabling their binary detection via tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions. These results establish a microscopic framework for quantum fluctuation-driven spin dynamics and provide a fundamental route toward spin-based quantum true random number generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents multiterminal Josephson junctions in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor InAsSb-Al nanocrosses. Hybrid nanocrosses are grown using molecular beam epitaxy and are formed through As-assisted merging of oppositely directed InAsSb nanowires. We explain this complex ternary merging mechanism using a temperature-dependent phase diagram and investigate the detailed crystal structure with atomic-resolution imaging. The hybrid nanoscrosses enabled the fabrication of multiterminal Josephson junction devices, which were characterized at low temperatures. The supercurrent through each terminal combination was measured as a function of the density in the junction and the relative phase of the terminals, which was controlled by an external magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling multiple wave properties simultaneously poses a key challenge in coherent control of wave transport. We present a theory for joint coherent control of transmission, reflection, and absorption in linear systems. We prove that the numerical range provides the mathematical structure governing achievable responses, and reveal non-abelian effects due to non-commutativity between transmission, reflection, and absorption matrices. We provide an algorithm to achieve arbitrary target responses. Our results establish a theoretical foundation for joint coherent control of waves.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Fracture Nonreciprocity at the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal intrinsic fracture nonreciprocity, manifesting as directional asymmetry in crack resistance, in two-dimensional heterostructures engineered through lattice-mismatched interfaces. Density-functional theory combined with machine-learning molecular dynamics show that intrinsic lattice mismatch between bonded component crystals imprints asymmetric prestrain states at crack tips, governing bond-breaking thresholds through charge redistribution. The failure criterion obeys a universal exponential scaling law between normalized charge density and bond strain, insensitive to bonding chemistry and local atomic environment. The magnitude of nonreciprocity scales systematically with lattice mismatch, reaching 49% at 10% mismatch. Validation across hexagonal, square, rectangular, and oblique two-dimensional lattices confirms universality, establishing interface strain engineering as a general design principle that bridges electronic structure to nanoscale failure, enabling rational design of damage-tolerant nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive tip-enhanced sum frequency generation spectroscopy using temporally asymmetric pulse for detecting weak vibrational signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for investigating molecular structures, orientations, and dynamics at surfaces. However, its spatial resolution is fundamentally restricted to the micrometer scale by the optical diffraction limit. Tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) using a scanning tunneling microscope has been developed to overcome this limitation. The acquired spectra exhibit characteristic dips originating from vibrational responses located within the strong broadband non-resonant background (NRB), which distorts and obscures the molecular signals. By making the second pulse temporally asymmetric and introducing a controlled delay between the first and second laser pulses, the NRB was effectively suppressed, which in turn amplified the vibrational response through interference and facilitated the detection of weak vibrational signals. This interference also made the technique phase-sensitive, enabling the determination of absolute molecular orientations. Furthermore, forward- and backward-scattered signals were simultaneously detected, conclusively confirming that the observed signals originated from tip enhancement rather than far-field contributions. Finally, the signal enhancement factor in TE-SFG was estimated to be $6.3\times 10^6-1.3\times 10^7$, based on the experimental data. This phase-sensitive TE-SFG technique overcomes the optical diffraction limit and enables the investigation of molecular vibrations at surfaces with unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Disorder-broadened topological Hall phase and anomalous Hall scaling in FeGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures that are promising candidates for low-power spintronic memory and logic devices. Realizing skyrmion-based devices requires an understanding of how structural disorder affects their stability and transport properties. This study uses Ne$^{+}$ ion irradiation at fluences from $10^{11}$ to $10^{14}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$ to systematically vary defect densities in 80 nm epitaxial FeGe films and quantify the resulting modifications to magnetic phase boundaries and electronic scattering. Temperature- and field-dependent Hall measurements reveal that increasing disorder progressively extends the topological Hall signal from a narrow window near 200\~K in pristine films down to 4\~K at the highest fluence, with peak amplitude more than doubling. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect transitions from quadratic Berry curvature scaling to linear skew scattering behavior, with the skew coefficient increasing threefold. These results establish quantitative correlations between defect concentration, skyrmion phase space, and transport mechanisms in a chiral magnet. It demonstrates that ion-beam modification provides systematic control over both topological texture stability and electrical detectability.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Terahertz Photoconductivity and Near-Field Imaging of Nanoscale Inhomogeneities in Multilayer Epitaxial Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study broadband terahertz (THz) conductivity and ultrafast photoconductivity spectra in lithographically fabricated multilayer epitaxial graphene nanoribbons grown on C- face of 6H-SiC substrate. THz near-field spectroscopy reveals local conductivity variations across nanoscale structural inhomogeneities such as wrinkles and grain boundaries within the multilayer graphene. Ultrabroadband THz far-field spectroscopy (0.15-16 THz) distinguishes doped graphene layers near the substrate from quasi-neutral layers (QNLs) further from the substrate. Temperature-dependent THz conductivity spectra are dominated by intra-band transitions both in the doped and QNLs. Photoexcitation then alters mainly the response of the QNLs: these exhibit a very high carrier mobility and a large positive THz photoconductivity with picosecond lifetime. The response of QNLs strongly depends on the carrier temperature $T_c$: the scattering time drops by an order of magnitude down to ~10 fs upon an increase of $T_c$ from 50 K to $T_c &gt;$ 1000 K, which is attributed to an enhanced electron-electron and electron- phonon scattering and to an interaction of electrons with mid-gap states.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity in two dimensions: intertwined symmetries and singlet-triplet mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity for the case of two-dimensional square- and triangular-lattice systems. Our approach is based on an effective single particle Hamiltonian which mimics the alternating spin splitting characteristic for the $d$-$wave$ and $i$-$wave$ altermagnetic state. By supplementing the model with intersite pairing term we characterize the principal features of the coexistent altermagnetic-superconducting state as well as the possibility of inducing the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase. Our calculations show that the subtle interplay between the symmetries of the superconducting and altermagnetic order parameters as well as the shape/size of the Fermi surface lead to various types of anisotropic behaviors of the resultant non-zero momentum pairing, which has not been possible in the originally proposed FFLO state. Moreover, in the considered systems additional pairing symmetries appear leading to an exotic multi-component order parameter with singlet-triplet mixing. To interpret the obtained data we analyze the Cooper pair density in the momentum space and the corresponding Fermi wave vector mismatch resulting from the altermagnetic spin splitting. We discuss our result in the context of possible applications like, e.g., the superconducting diode.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing</title>

Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide predictions testable in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-Markovian Hatano-Nelson model</title>

Abstract: While considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians arising in the presence of dissipation, in most cases, the dissipation is taken to be frequency independent. However, this idealization may not always be applicable in experimental settings, where dissipation can be frequency-dependent. Such frequency-dependent dissipation leads to non-Markovian behavior. In this work, we demonstrate how a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model, a paradigmatic non-Hermitian system with nonreciprocal hopping, arises microscopically in a quasi-one-dimensional dissipative lattice. This is achieved using non-equilibrium Green's functions without requiring any approximation like weak system-bath coupling or a time-scale separation, which would have been necessary for a Markovian treatment. The resulting effective system exhibits nonreciprocal hopping, as well as uniform dissipation, both of which are frequency-dependent. This holds for both bosonic and fermionic settings. We find solely non-Markovian nonreciprocal features like unidirectional frequency blocking in bosonic setting, and a non-equilibrium dissipative quantum phase transition in fermionic setting, that cannot be captured in a Markovian theory, nor have any analog in reciprocal systems. Our results lay the groundwork for describing and engineering non-Markovian nonreciprocal quantum lattices.</description>

Abstract: Group IV quantum dot hole spin systems, exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling, provide platforms for various qubit architectures. The rapid advancement of solid-state technologies has significantly improved qubit quality, including the time scales characterizing electrical operation, relaxation, and dephasing. At this stage of development, understanding the relations between the underlying spin-orbit coupling and experimental parameters, such as quantum dot geometry and external electric and magnetic fields, has become a priority. Here we focus on a Ge hole double quantum dot in the Pauli spin blockade regime and present a complete analysis of the leakage current under an out-of-plane magnetic field. By considering a model of anisotropic in-plane confinement and $k^3$-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we determine the behaviour of the leakage current as a function of detuning, magnetic field magnitude, interdot distance, and individual dot ellipticities. We identify regions in which the leakage current can be suppressed by quantum dot geometry designs. Most importantly, by rotating one of the quantum dots, we observe that the quantum dot shape induces a strongly anisotropic leakage current. These findings provide guidelines for probing the spin-orbit coupling, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the precision of Pauli spin blockade readout in hole qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Controlled Chirality Switching of Weyl Quasiparticles</title>

Abstract: Weyl quasiparticles, as gapless low-energy excitations with nontrivial chirality, have garnered extensive interest in recent years. However, archieving effective and reversible control over their chirality (topological charge) remains a major challeng due to topological protection. In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems with non-reciprocal hopping may display the non-Hermitian skin effect, where states under open boundary conditions localize exponentially at one edge of the system. This localization has been linked to spectral winding and topological gain, forming a bulk-boundary correspondence akin to the one relating edge modes to bulk topological invariants in topological insulators and superconductors. In this work, we establish a bulk-boundary correspondence for disordered Hatano-Nelson models. We relate the localization of states to spectral winding using the Lyapunov exponent and the Thouless formula. We identify two kinds of phase transitions and relate them to transport properties. Our framework is relevant to a broad class of 1D non-Hermitian models, opening new directions for disorder-resilient transport and quantum-enhanced sensing in photonic, optomechanical, and superconducting platforms.</description>

      <title>Microsecond-Pulsed Nanocalorimetry: A Scalable Approach for Ultrasensitive Heat Capacity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nanocalorimetric technique based on microsecond-pulsed heating (\mu s-PHnC) that enables high-sensitivity, quasi-isothermal heat capacity measurements on nanoscale samples. Such resolution is critical for exploring thermodynamic signatures in low-dimensional materials, where conventional techniques fall short. By confining thermal excitation to microsecond timescales, this approach minimizes lateral heat diffusion, reduces heat capacity addenda to below 10^{-9} J K^{-1}, and achieves noise densities as low as 75 pJ K^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} mm^{-2}, unlocking precise thermodynamic characterization of subnanogram samples in areas as small as 30 x 30 \mu m^{2}. The method delivers exceptional temperature homogeneity, as demonstrated by resolving sharp phase transitions, such as the antiferromagnetic transition in ultrathin CoO films, with unprecedented clarity. Its quasi-static operation is inherently compatible with external stimuli, including magnetic and electric fields, thereby expanding its utility for in-operando thermodynamic studies. This advancement establishes a robust and scalable platform for probing thermal phenomena in nanostructured and low-dimensional materials, significantly broadening the scope of nanocalorimetry.</description>

      <title>Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>

Abstract: High-quality micropillar cavities were grown using molecular-beam epitaxy. Stable continuous-wave lasing at room-temperature was demonstrated for microlasers with semiconductor and hybrid output mirrors. At 300 K, single-mode lasing was demonstrated for micropillars with a diameter of 5 $\mu$m at a wavelength of 960 nm, with a minimum lasing threshold of 1.2 mW and a bare quality-factor exceeding 8000.</description>
