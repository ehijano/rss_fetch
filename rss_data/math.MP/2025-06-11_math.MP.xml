      <title>Inverse scattering problem for the third-order equation on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the third-order linear differential equation $$\displaystyle\frac{d^3\psi}{dx^3}+Q(x)\,\displaystyle\frac{d\psi}{dx}+P(x)\,\psi=k^3\,\psi,\qquad x\in\mathbb R,$$ where the complex-valued potentials $Q$ and $P$ are assumed to belong to the Schwartz class. We describe the basic solutions, the scattering coefficients, and the bound-state information, and we introduce the dependency constants and the normalization constants at the bound states. When the secondary reflection coefficients are zero, we provide a method to solve the corresponding inverse scattering problem, where the goal is to recover the two potentials $Q$ and $P$ from the scattering data set consisting of the transmission and primary reflection coefficients and the bound-state information. We formulate the corresponding inverse scattering problem as a Riemann--Hilbert problem on the complex $k$-plane and describe how the potentials are recovered from the solution to the Riemann--Hilbert problem. In the absence of bound states, we introduce a linear integral equation, which is the analog of the Marchenko integral equation used in the inverse scattering theory for the full-line Schr\"odinger equation. We describe the recovery of the two potentials from the solution to the aforementioned linear integral equation.</description>

      <title>Interpolations for a quantum Parisi formula in transverse field mean-field spin glass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum Parisi formula for the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is proven with an elementary mathematical method. First, a self-overlap corrected quantum model of the transverse field SK model is represented in terms of the Hamiltonian with annealed random interactions. The interpolation given by Guerra and Toninelli is extended to the self-overlap corrected quantum model. It is proven that the infinite-volume limit of the free energy density exists in the operator formalism. Next, another interpolation developed by Guerra and Talagrand is applied to obtain a finite step replica-symmetry breaking (RSB) bound on the free energy density in the transverse field SK model. The interpolation enables us to show that the deviation of the RSB solution from the exact solution vanishes in the self-overlap corrected quantum model in a functional representation of the quantum spin operators. Finally, the corrected terms are removed by the Hopf-Lax formula for a nonlinear partial differential equation to show the quantum Parisi formula for the original transverse field SK model. The formula is extended to that for the transverse field mean-field $p$-spin glass model.</description>

      <title>General solutions to the equations of acoustics in inhomogeneous media and gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers one-dimensional equations of acoustics equations of inhomogeneous media and the system of gas dynamics equations with constant entropy. Using the Riemann approach, the gas dynamics equations are reduced to a second-order linear hyperbolic equation with variable coefficients. Solutions to this equation are constructed using Euler transformations. This allows us to find new exact solutions of the equations of acoustics and gas dynamics, depending on two arbitrary functions.</description>

      <title>Recurrence relations and the Christoffel-Darboux formula for elliptic orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on algebraic curves, particularly on genus 1 surfaces. In this paper, we focus on elliptic orthogonal polynomials and establish several of their fundamental properties. In particular, we derive general five-term and seven-term recurrence relations, which lead to a Christoffel-Darboux formula and the construction of an associated point process on the A-cycle of the torus. Notably, the recurrence coefficients in these relations are intricately linked through the underlying elliptic curve equation. Under additional symmetry assumptions on the weight function, the structure simplifies considerably, recovering known results for orthogonal polynomials on the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Decay of Interatomic Force Constants in the Reduced Hartree-Fock Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay of the interatomic force constants (equivalently, the smoothness properties of the dynamical matrix) in perfect crystals both at finite electronic temperature, and for insulators at zero temperature, within the reduced Hartree-Fock approximation (also called Random Phase Approximation). At finite temperature the electrons are mobile, leading to exponential decay of the force constants. In insulators, there is incomplete screening, leading to an algebraic decay of dipole-dipole interaction type.</description>

      <title>Metriplectic relaxation to equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metriplectic dynamical systems consist of a special combination of a Hamiltonian and a (generalized) entropy-gradient flow, such that the Hamiltonian is conserved and entropy is dissipated/produced (depending on a sign convention). It is natural to expect that, in the long-time limit, the orbit of a metriplectic system should converge to an extremum of entropy restricted to a constant-Hamiltonian surface. In this paper, we discuss sufficient conditions for this to occur, and construct a class of metriplectic systems that satisfy one such condition. The proposed metriplectic structure is inspired by the Landau operator for Coulomb collisions in plasmas, which is included as special case. We apply these results to the construction of relaxation methods for the solution of equilibrium problems in fluid dynamics and plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Radon Transforms and the SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we consider the effect of Radon or X-ray transformations, on the Laplace eigenfunctions in hyperbolic Bolyai-Lobachevsky space. We show that the Radon map from this space to Lorentzian-signature Anti-de Sitter or de Sitter space is easier to interpret if we use the Poincare disc model and eigenfunctions rather than the upper-half-plane model. In particular, this version of the transform reveals the geometric origin of the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions that are involved in calculating the SYK four-point function.</description>

Abstract: The paper contributes to building algebraic foundations of self-organized criticality answering a previously unsolved question about the limiting structure of the extended sandpile group as well as relating it to another limit at the level of classical sandpile groups with respect to certain monomorphisms, and puts forward a concept of canonical sandpile epimorphisms, drawing an unexpected consequence about the divisibility properties of the numbers of spanning trees on rectangles.</description>

      <title>Displacement of three-phase flow for Heavy Oil: Riemann Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the Riemann solution for three-phase flow in porous media under the condition that oil viscosity exceeds that of water and gas. We classify all Riemann solution problems for scenarios where the left states $L$ lie along the edge $G$-$W$, and the right states $R$ span nearly the entire saturation triangle, excluding small regions near the boundaries $G$-$O$ and $W$-$O$. We use the wave curve method to determine the Riemann solution for initial and injection data within the above-mentioned class. This study extends previous analytical solutions, which were limited to right states near the corner $O$ or within the quadrilateral $O$-$E$-$\mathcal{U}$-$D$. Notably, this classification remains valid for all viscosity variations satisfying the inequalities \eqref{eq:classical}, corresponding to viscosity regimes where the umbilic point is close to the vertex $O$. We verify the $L^1_{loc}$-stability of the Riemann solution with respect to variations in the data. While we do not establish the uniqueness of the Riemann solution, extensive numerical experiments confirm its validity. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding three-phase flow dynamics in porous media under a wide range of conditions.</description>

      <title>(2+1)d Lattice Models and Tensor Networks for Gapped Phases with Categorical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider ``All boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have extended the concept of global symmetries in several directions, offering new perspectives across a wide range of physical systems. This work shows that generalized global symmetries naturally emerge in shallow water systems. In particular, we demonstrate that both global and gauge subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the underlying gauge subsystem symmetries, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond gauge symmetries, we also identify global subsystem symmetries, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.</description>

      <title>$x-y$ swap for $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of 2D gravity -- ``matrix model'' duality on the example of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. We propose a reformulation of the duality, related to a more conventional one by ``$x-y$ swap'' in the language of topological recursion. This formulation elucidates some conceptual and technical difficulties in the dictionary of the duality and relation to other examples. In particular, it allows to circumvent the necessity to use ``resonance transformations'', that were previously introduced to match the worldsheet and ``matrix model'' correlators, and the expressions for minimal string amplitudes in this approach are reminiscent of the ones obtained recently for ``complex Liouville string'' theory. Using this new approach, we also formulate a conjecture on how one can compute amplitudes with operators other than tachyons in the dual theory.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

      <title>Effective criteria for entanglement witnesses in small dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective set of necessary and sufficient criteria for block-positivity of matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{C}$. The approach is based on Sturm sequences and quartic polynomial positivity conditions presented in recent literature. The procedure allows us to test whether a given $4\times 4$ complex matrix corresponds to an entanglement witness, and it is exact when the matrix coefficients belong to the rationals, extended by $\mathrm{i}$. The method can be generalized to $\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\mathcal{H}_d$ systems for $d&gt;2$ to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity. We also outline an alternative approach to the problem relying on Gr\"obner bases.</description>

      <title>Transition Path Theory For L\'{e}vy-Type Processes: SDE Representation and Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a Transition Path Theory (TPT) for L\'{e}vy-type processes, addressing a critical gap in the study of the transition mechanism between meta-stabile states in non-Gaussian stochastic systems. A key contribution is the rigorous derivation of the stochastic differential equation (SDE) representation for transition path processes, which share the same distributional properties as transition trajectories, along with a proof of its well-posedness. This result provides a solid theoretical foundation for sampling transition trajectories. The paper also investigates the statistical properties of transition trajectories, including their probability distribution, probability current, and rate of occurrence.</description>

      <title>Schramm-Loewner evolution contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet when $\kappa$ is close to 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE$_\kappa$) for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, which is the regime where the curve is self-intersecting but not space-filling. We show that there exists $\delta_0&gt;0$ such that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the range of an SLE$_\kappa$ curve almost surely contains a topological Sierpi\'nski carpet. Combined with a result of Ntalampekos (2021), this implies that in this parameter range, SLE$_\kappa$ is almost surely conformally non-removable, and the conformal welding problem for SLE$_\kappa$ does not have a unique solution. Our result also implies that for $\kappa \in (8 - \delta_0,8)$, the adjacency graph of the complementary connected components of the SLE$_\kappa$ curve is disconnected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates Hermitian linear maps, focusing on their decomposition into completely positive (CP) maps and their extensions to CP maps using auxiliary spaces. We derive a precise lower bound on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the negative component in any CP decomposition, proving its attainability through the Jordan decomposition. Additionally, we demonstrate that the positive part of this decomposition provides the optimal CP approximation in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We also determine the minimal dimension of an auxiliary space required to extend a Hermitian map to a CP map, with explicit constructions provided. Practical examples illustrate the application of our results.</description>

      <title>Higher Chiral Algebras in a Polysimplicial Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertex algebras are equivalent to translation-equivariant chiral algebras on $\mathbb{A}^1$, in the sense of Beilinson and Drinfeld. In this paper we give an algebraic construction of a chiral algebra on $\mathbb{A}^n$; this can be seen as an algebraic construction of a higher-dimensional vertex algebra.
  We introduce a model, in dg commutative algebras, of the derived algebra of functions on the configuration space of $k$ distinct labelled marked points in $\mathbb{A}^n$. Working in this model -- which we call the polysimplicial model -- we obtain a dg operad of chiral operations on a degree-shifted copy of the canonical sheaf. We prove that there is a quasi-isomorphism, to this dg operad, from the Lie-infinity operad. This result makes the shifted canonical sheaf into a first example of a homotopy polysimplicial chiral algebra on $\mathbb{A}^n$, in a sense which generalizes to higher dimensions Malikov and Schechtman's notion of a homotopy chiral algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the global existence and scattering for small and localized solutions of the Klein-Gordon-Schr\"{o}dinger system in three dimensions. The system consists of coupled semilinear Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations with quadratic nonlinearities. This model is motivated by the study of plasma oscillations arising from the Hartree equation near a translation-invariant equilibrium with the Coulomb potential. Our proof relies on the space-time resonance method. The main difficulty comes from the two dimensional space-time resonant set and the absence of null form structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of the double copy for gauge theories that exhibit off-shell color-kinematics duality within the Batalin-Vilkovitsky (BV) formalism. As illustrative examples, we consider the double copies of Chern-Simons theory, four-dimensional BF theory, and two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, and we discuss possible gravity interpretations for these cases. We formalize the construction and demonstrate that Kodaira-Spencer gravity, K\"ahler gravity, and their generalizations, fit naturally within this framework. In particular, Kodaira-Spencer gravity emerges as a gauge theory describing deformations of generalized complex structures, while the double copy of Chern-Simons theory captures the deformation of the Courant bracket.</description>

      <title>Sequential Dynamics in Ising Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first exact asymptotic characterization of sequential dynamics for a broad class of local update algorithms on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model with Ising spins. Focusing on dynamics implemented via systematic scan -- encompassing Glauber updates at any temperature -- we analyze the regime where the number of spin updates scales linearly with system size. Our main result provides a description of the spin-field trajectories as the unique solution to a system of integro-difference equations derived via Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) applied to a novel block approximation. This framework captures the time evolution of macroscopic observables such as energy and overlap, and is numerically tractable. Our equations serve as a discrete-spin sequential-update analogue of the celebrated Cugliandolo-Kurchan equations for spherical spin glasses, resolving a long-standing gap in the theory of Ising spin glass dynamics. Beyond their intrinsic theoretical interest, our results establish a foundation for analyzing a wide variety of asynchronous dynamics on the hypercube and offer new avenues for studying algorithmic limitations of local heuristics in disordered systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum interactions exchanging different types of particles play a pivotal r\^{o}le in quantum many-body theory, but they are not sufficiently investigated from a mathematical perspective. Here, we consider a system made of two fermions and one boson, in order to study the effect of such an off-diagonal interaction term, having in mind the physics of cuprate superconductors. Additionally, our model also includes a generalized Hubbard interaction (i.e., a general local repulsion term for the fermions). Regarding pairing, exponentially localized dressed bound fermion pairs are shown to exist and their effective dispersion relation is studied in detail. Scattering properties of the system are derived for two channels: the unbound and bound pair channels. We give particular attention to the regime of very large on-site (Hubbard) repulsions, because this situation is relevant for cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Variational formulations of transport on combinatorial meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09443v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop analogues of the primal and mixed variational formulations of the conservation laws describing transport of scalar physical properties for topological spaces referred to as cell complexes. The development is restricted to cell complexes with cells having connectivity of simple polytopes. Such spaces are suitable representations of physical systems composed of elements of different apparent topological dimensions, where all elements might have individual properties, and elements of a given dimension might interact via common elements of lower dimensions. This modelling foundation can be considered as intermediate between the foundation for particle-based modelling, which is the discrete topology, and the foundation for continuum modelling, which is the smooth topology. The new foundation offers advantages for the analysis of the behaviour of physical systems with complex internal structures. The development is based on a calculus with combinatorial differential forms which is a discrete analogue of the smooth exterior calculus with differential forms. We call the resulting calculus combinatorial mesh calculus (CMC) as it is based on combinatorial meshes, for which embedding is forgotten and only the connectivity between cells and measures of the cells are used in calculations. We discuss how the obtained formulation is specialised for several different problems, including mass diffusion, heat conduction, fluid flow in porous media, and charge diffusion, and provide details about the formulation of initial boundary value problems for these transport cases. Examples and results for selected boundary value problems are given to demonstrate the capabilities of the CMC formulations.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry of Spencer-Hodge Decompositions in Constrained Geometric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the interaction mechanism between metric structures and mirror transformations in Spencer complexes of compatible pairs. Our core contribution is the establishment of mirror symmetry for Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, solving the key technical problem of analyzing the behavior of metric geometry under sign transformations. Through precise operator difference analysis, we prove that the perturbation $\mathcal{R}^k = -2(-1)^k \omega \otimes \delta^{\lambda}_{\mathfrak{g}}(s)$ induced by the mirror transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$ is a bounded compact operator, and apply Fredholm theory to establish the mirror invariance of harmonic space dimensions $\dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,\lambda} = \dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,-\lambda}$. We further prove the complete invariance of constraint strength metrics and curvature geometric metrics under mirror transformations, thus ensuring the spectral structure stability of Spencer-Hodge Laplacians. From a physical geometric perspective, our results reveal that sign transformations of constraint forces do not affect the essential topological structure of constraint systems, embodying deep symmetry principles in constraint geometry. This work connects Spencer metric theory with mirror symmetry theory, laying the foundation for further development of constraint geometric analysis and computational methods.</description>

      <title>The Kirkwood closure point process: A solution of the Kirkwood-Salsburg equations for negative activities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kirkwood superposition is a well-known tool in statistical physics to approximate the $n$-point correlation functions for $n\geq 3$ in terms of the density $\rho $ and the radial distribution function $g$ of the underlying system. However, it is unclear whether these approximations are themselves the correlation functions of some point process. If they are, this process is called the Kirkwood closure process. For the case that $g$ is the negative exponential of some nonnegative and regular pair potential $u$ existence of the the Kirkwood closure process was proved by Ambartzumian and Sukiasian. This result was generalized to the case that $u$ is a locally stable and regular pair potential by Kuna, Lebowitz and Speer, provided that $\rho$ is sufficiently small. In this work, it is shown that it suffices for $u$ to be stable and regular to ensure the existence of the Kirkwood closure process. Furthermore, for locally stable $u$ it is proved that the Kirkwood closure process is Gibbs and that the kernel of the GNZ-equation satisfies a Kirkwood-Salsburg type equation.</description>

Abstract: We prove the convergence of normal form power series for suitably nonsingular analytic submanifolds under a broad class of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-group actions. Our theorem is illustrated by a number of examples, and includes, as a particular case, Chern and Moser's celebrated convergence theorem for normal forms of real hypersurfaces. The construction of normal forms relies on the equivariant moving frame method, while the convergence proof is based on the realization that the normal form can be recovered as part of the solution to an initial value problem for an involutive system of differential equations, whose analyticity is guaranteed by the Cartan-K\"ahler Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a highly efficient integration method for scattering calculations, and a ``partial rate matrix'' that encodes the scattering rate as a function of the $SO(3)$ orientation of the detector. This replaces the original multidimensional rate integral with a simple exercise in vector multiplication, speeding up the rate calculation by a factor of around $10^8$. I include a scheme to fully factorize the dark matter particle model, its astrophysical velocity distribution, and the properties of the target material from each other, enabling efficient calculation of the partial rate matrix even in studies comparing large sets of these input functions. This is now the only sensible way to evaluate the dark matter scattering rate in anisotropic detector materials. It is straightforward to generalize this method to other difficult but linear problems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Harmonic Integration Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new integration method drastically improves the efficiency of the dark matter direct detection calculation. In this work I introduce a complete, orthogonal basis of spherical wavelet-harmonic functions, designed for the new vector space integration method. This factorizes the numeric calculation into a ``vector'' that depends only on the astrophysical velocity distribution; a second vector, depending only on the detector form factor; and a scattering matrix defined on the basis functions, which depends on the details of the dark matter (DM) particle model (e.g.~its mass). For common spin-independent DM--Standard Model interactions, this scattering matrix can be evaluated analytically in the wavelet-harmonic basis. This factorization is particularly helpful for the more complicated analyses that have become necessary in recent years, especially those involving anisotropic detector materials or more realistic models of the local DM velocity distribution. With the new method, analyses studying large numbers of detector orientations and DM particle models can be performed more than 10~million times faster.
  This paper derives several analytic results for the spherical wavelets, including an extrapolation in the space of wavelet coefficients, and a generalization of the vector space method to a much broader class of linear functional integrals. Both results are highly relevant outside the field of DM direct detection.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of Mandelbrot cascades -- in the context of vector-valued martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem of determining the Fourier dimension of the Mandelbrot canonical cascade measure (MCCM). This problem of significant interest was raised by Mandelbrot in 1976 and reiterated by Kahane in 1993. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Fourier dimension of the MCCM for random weights $W$ satisfying the condition $\mathbb{E}[W^t]&lt;\infty$ for all $t&gt;0$. As a corollary, we prove that the MCCM is Salem if and only if the random weight has a specific two-point distribution. In addition, we show that the MCCM is Rajchman with polynomial Fourier decay whenever the random weight satisfies $\mathbb{E}[W^{1+\delta}]&lt;\infty$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. As a consequence, we discover that, in the Biggins-Kyprianou's boundary case, the Fourier dimension of the MCCM exhibits a second order phase transition at the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/2$; we establish the upper Frostman regularity for MCCM; and we obtain a Fourier restriction estimate for MCCM.
  The major novelty of this paper is the discovery of putting the fine analysis of Fourier decay for multiplicative chaos measures into the theory of vector-valued martingales. This new viewpoint is of fundamental importance in the study of Fourier decay of multiplicative chaos measures. Indeed, in the sequel to this paper, combining the vector-valued martingale methods and ideas from Littlewood-Paley theory, the precise Fourier dimensions will be established for various classical models of multiplicative chaos measures including GMC of all dimensions, microcanonical Mandelbrot cascades, Mandelbrot random coverings, as well as Fourier-Walsh analysis of these models.</description>

      <title>Can Yang-Baxter imply Lie algebra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum knot invariants (like colored HOMFLY-PT or Kauffman polynomials) are a distinguished class of non-perturbative topological invariants. Any known way to construct them (via Chern-Simons theory or quantum R-matrix) starts with a finite simple Lie algebra. Another set of knot invariants - of finite type - is related to quantum invariants via a perturbative expansion. However can all finite type invariants be obtained in this way? Investigating this problem, P. Vogel discovered a way to polynomially parameterize the expansion coefficients with three parameters so that, at different specific values, this reproduces the answers for all simple Lie (super)algebras. Then it is easy to construct a polynomial $P_{alg}$ that vanishes for all simple Lie algebras, and the corresponding Vassiliev invariant would thus be absent from the perturbative expansion.
  We review these Vogel claims pointing out at least two interesting implications of his construction. First, we discuss whether infinite-dimensional Lie algebras might enlarge Chern-Simons theory. Second, Vogel's construction implies an alternative axiomatization of simple Lie algebras - when we start from knot invariants and arrive at Lie algebras and their classification, which is opposite to conventional logic that we mentioned at the beginning.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Wigner matrix $W_{n}$ of dimension $n \times n$ as $n \to \infty$. The objective of this paper is two folds: first we construct an operator $\mathcal{W}$ on a suitable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and then define a suitable notion of convergence such that the matrices $W_{n}$ converge in that notion of convergence to $\mathcal{W}$. We further investigate some properties of $\mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{H}$. We show that $\mathcal{H}$ is a nontrivial extension of $L^{2}[0,1]$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure and the spectral measure of $\mathcal{W}$ at any function $f \in L^{2}[0,1]$ is almost surely the semicircular law.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Combinatorial Riemann Boundary Value Problem and Lattice Walks Avoiding a Quadrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework of matrix-form combinatorial Riemann boundary value problem (cRBVP) to characterize the integrability of functional equations arising in lattice walk enumerations. A matrix cRBVP is defined as integrable if it can be reduced to enough polynomial equations with one catalytic variable. Our central results establish that the integrability depends on the eigenspace of some matrix associated to the problem. For lattice walks in three quadrants, we demonstrate how the obstinate kernel method transforms a discrete difference equation into a $3\times 3$ matrix cRBVP. The special double-roots eigenvalue $1/4$ yields two independent polynomial equations in the problem. The other single-root eigenvalue yields a linear equation. We obtain three independent equations from a $3\times 3$ system. Crucially, our framework generalizes three-quadrant walks with Weyl symmetry to models satisfying only orbit-sum conditions. It explains many criteria about the orbit-sum proposed by various researchers and it also explains the counter-example of lattice walks starting outside the quadrant.</description>

      <title>Dressed fields for Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String-localized QFT allows to explain Standard Model interactions in an autonomous way, committed to quantum principles rather than a "gauge principle", thus avoiding an indefinite state space and compensating ghosts. The resulting perturbative scattering matrix is known (at tree-level) to be insensitive to the non-locality of the auxiliary "string-localized fields" used in the construction. For the examples of Yang-Mills and QCD, we prove that it is actually equivalent to the perturbative S-matrix of gauge theory, restricted to physical particle states. The role of classical gauge invariance is revealed along the way. The main tool are "dressed fields", that are intermediate between free fields and interacting fields, and for which we give explicit formulas at all orders. The renormalization of loops, as well as non-perturbative issues are not adressed, but we hint at the possibility, enabled by our approach, that qualitative traces of confinement may be visible already at the level of the dressed fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC (which in particular resolves the Garban-Vargas conjecture); the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact values of Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Duality Between Constraints and Gauge Fields: Mirror Symmetry and Spencer Isomorphisms of Compatible Pairs on Principal Bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a mirror symmetry theory of Spencer cohomology within the geometric framework of constrained systems on principal bundles, revealing deep symmetric structures in constraint geometry. Based on compatible pairs $(D,\lambda)$ under strong transversality conditions, we construct a systematic family of mirror transformations: from basic sign mirrors $\lambda \mapsto -\lambda$ to general automorphism-induced mirrors $\lambda \mapsto (d\phi)^*(\lambda)$. Our core result proves that these transformations preserve all geometric properties of compatible pairs and induce natural isomorphisms between Spencer cohomology groups. This theory unifies constraint mechanics, gauge field theory, and differential topology, establishing a complete mathematical framework for symmetry analysis of constraint systems and revealing the special mirror structure of Spencer complexes in constraint geometry.</description>

      <title>Constructing Two Metrics for Spencer Cohomology: Hodge Decomposition of Constrained Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a metric framework for Spencer complexes based on the geometric theory of compatible pairs $(D,\lambda)$ in principal bundle constraint systems, solving fundamental technical problems in computing Spencer cohomology of constraint systems. We develop two complementary and geometrically natural metric schemes: a tensor metric based on constraint strength weighting and an induced metric arising from principal bundle curvature geometry, both maintaining deep compatibility with the strong transversality structure of compatible pairs. Through establishing the corresponding Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, we rigorously prove that both metrics provide complete elliptic structures for Spencer complexes, thereby guaranteeing the existence, uniqueness and finite-dimensionality of Hodge decompositions. It reveals that the strong transversality condition of compatible pairs is not only a necessary property of constraint geometry, but also key to the elliptic regularity of Spencer operators, while the introduction of constraint strength functions and curvature weights provides natural weighting mechanisms for metric structures that coordinate with the intrinsic geometry of constraint systems. This theory tries to unify the differential geometric methods of constraint mechanics, cohomological analysis tools of gauge field theory, and classical techniques of Hodge theory in differential topology, establishing a mathematical foundation for understanding and computing topological invariants of complex constraint systems.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures up to the spectral edge, and it was obtained as a consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measures for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies, up to the border of the absolutely continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry in Geometric Constraints: Analytic and Riemann-Roch Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon the discovery of mirror symmetry phenomena in compatible pair Spencer complexes, this paper develops rigorous analytical foundations through systematic application of elliptic perturbation theory and characteristic class analysis. We establish a comprehensive multi-level framework revealing the mathematical mechanisms underlying the symbolic transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$: metric invariance analysis via Spencer metric theory, topological isomorphisms through elliptic operator perturbation methods, and algebraic geometric equivalences via GAGA principle and characteristic class machinery.
  Main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of Spencer-Hodge Laplacian perturbation relations and cohomological mirror isomorphisms using Fredholm theory; (2) Complete characteristic class equivalence theorems establishing algebraic geometric foundations for mirror symmetry; (3) Systematic Spencer-Riemann-Roch decomposition formulas with explicit error estimates on Calabi-Yau manifolds; (4) Computational verification frameworks demonstrated on elliptic curves.
  This research demonstrates that mirror symmetry in constraint geometry possesses deep analytical structure accessible through modern elliptic theory and algebraic geometry, establishing Spencer complexes as a bridge between constraint analysis and contemporary geometric theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Zakharov-Ito equation \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  u_t+u_{xxx}+3uu_x+\rho\rho_x=0,
  \rho_t+{(u\rho)}_x=0.
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  We prove the local well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s&gt;3/2$ and global well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s\geq2$. When $\rho=0$, the Zakharov-Ito equation reduces to the KdV equation, hence has solitary waves with speeds $c\in(0,+\infty)$. We prove the orbital stability of these solitary waves in $H^1\times L^2$ by combining a variational approach and the framework of Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss \cite{GSS1987}.</description>

      <title>Spencer Differential Degeneration Theory and Its Applications in Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the compatible pair theory of principal bundle constraint systems, this paper discovers and establishes a complete Spencer differential degeneration theory. We prove that when symmetric tensors satisfy a $\lambda$-dependent kernel condition $\delta_{\mathfrak{g}}^{\lambda}(s)=0$, the Spencer differential degenerates to the standard exterior differential, thus establishing a precise bridge between the complex Spencer theory and the classical de Rham theory. One of the advances in this paper is the rigorous proof that this degeneration condition remains stable under mirror transformations, revealing the profound symmetry origins of this phenomenon. Based on these rigorous mathematical results, we construct a canonical mapping from degenerate Spencer cocycles to de Rham cohomology and elucidate its geometric meaning. Finally, we demonstrate the application potential of this theory in algebraic geometry, particularly on K3 surfaces, where we preliminarily verify that this framework can systematically identify (1,1)-Hodge classes satisfying algebraicity conditions. This work provides new perspectives and technical approaches for studying algebraic invariants using tools from constraint geometry.</description>

      <title>Universality of Photonic Interlacing Architectures for Learning Discrete Linear Unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations suggest that the discrete linear unitary group $U(N)$ can be represented by interlacing a finite sequence of diagonal phase operations with an intervening unitary operator. However, despite rigorous numerical justifications, no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that elements of $U(N)$ can be decomposed into a sequence of $N$-parameter phases alternating with $1$-parameter propagators of a lattice Hamiltonian. The proof is based on building a Lie group by alternating these two operators and showing its completeness to represent $U(N)$ for a finite number of layers, which is numerically found to be exactly $N$. This architecture can be implemented using elementary optical components and can successfully reconstruct arbitrary unitary matrices. We propose example devices such as optical logic gates, which perform logic gate operations using a single-layer lossless and passive optical circuit design.</description>

      <title>KP-PINNs: Kernel Packet Accelerated Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems. Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific computing.</description>

Abstract: Accurate quantification of local packing density and mixing in simulations of particulate systems is essential for many industrial applications. Traditional methods which simply count the number of particle centres within a given volume of space (cell) introduce discontinuities at cell boundaries, leading to unreliable measurement of packing density. We introduce Packing3D, an open-source Julia package providing analytic, partial-volume calculations for spheres intersecting Cartesian and cylindrical meshes. Our goals were to (1) eliminate boundary-artifact jumps, (2) maintain high throughput on large datasets, and (3) deliver standard mixing metrics via a unified API. We derive closed-form solutions for single, double and triple spherical-cap intersections, plus sphere-cylinder overlaps. A short-circuit bounding-sphere test shortens computations: fully inside or outside spheres are handled in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, and only near-boundary spheres invoke the analytic kernels. We implement efficient mesh-generation routines, principal-cell indexing, and data-splitting functions for time-series analyses. Performance and accuracy were validated against simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices and via boundary-shift continuity tests. Packing3D converges exactly to theoretical lattice densities, eliminates discontinuities at sub-particle resolution, and processes up to $10^8$ sphere-cell intersections per second in single-threaded Julia with linear scaling in particle count. Memory usage remains modest (40 B per particle, 48 B per cell). Packing3D provides researchers with continuous, reproducible volume-fraction fields and robust mixing indices at high performance, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimisation in granular process engineering.
