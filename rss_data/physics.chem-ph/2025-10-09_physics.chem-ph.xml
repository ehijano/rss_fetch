      <title>Analysis of divergent dynamics of exactly factorized electron-nuclear wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Exact Factorization (XF) of molecular wavefunctions can be viewed as an 'electronic wavepacket' framework for quantum dynamics. It is an appealing alternative to the conventional non-adiabatic dynamics, unfolding in the space of coupled electronic eigenstates. However, implementation of the non-linear XF equations for general systems presents a formidable challenge: the XF counterparts to the non-adiabatic coupling involve division by the nuclear probability density, which leads to severe numerical instabilities in the low-density regions of space. In case of the non-adiabatic dynamics the effect of coupling is relatively smooth, but this theoretical framework becomes impractical when numerous electronic states are involved. In this paper the origin of the XF-specific challenge is analyzed analytically. We demonstrate that the problem arises when the factorized wavefunction diverges, even without the explicit coupling of the Born-Huang electronic states used to describe the molecular wavefunction. Using a 'minimal' model of the photodissociation, we derive expressions for the XF dynamics and locate the source of the XF instability. We analyze the dependence of this instability on the nuclear wavefunction bifurcation in the stationary and moving frames of reference, the latter associated with the quantum trajectory ensemble describing the nuclear XF wavepacket in a compact form. We show that the near-singular behavior persists in the moving frame and in the atomic basis representation of the electronic wavefunction. This model and insight into the root of the XF implementation challenge will help to address the issue, leading to further development of the XF methods.</description>

      <title>Factorized electron-nuclear dynamics with effective complex potential: on-the-fly implementation for H$_2^+$ in a laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional theoretical and computational approaches to fully coupled quantum molecular dynamics, i.e. when both the electrons and nuclei are treated as quantum-mechanical particles, are impractical for all but the smallest chemical systems. In this paper we describe the formalism and implementation of the Factorized Electron Nuclear Dynamics (FENDy) with effective complex potential [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 19 (2023), pp 1393-1408], which goes beyond the established framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation or Born-Huang expansion of the molecular wavefunction. This method is based on the exact factorization of the molecular wavefunction, with the nuclei evolving under a complex time-dependent potential which captures the key features of dynamics in the nuclear subspace. The complementary electronic component of the molecular wavefunction is normalized to one for all nuclear configurations. We implement and employ FENDy to model the dynamics of H$_2^+$ molecular ion under a femtosecond laser pulse. The electronic wavefunction is represented within the standard electronic structure bases without referencing the electronic eigenstates. The nuclear wavefunction is represented as a quantum-trajectory ensemble, which in principle circumvents the exponential scaling of the numerical cost with the system size. The challenging evaluation of the gradients on unstructured grids is performed by projection on auxiliary bases.</description>

      <title>Transferable Generative Models Bridge Femtosecond to Nanosecond Time-Step Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding molecular structure, dynamics, and reactivity requires bridging processes that occur across widely separated time scales. Conventional molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic resolution, but their femtosecond time steps limit access to the slow conformational changes and relaxation processes that govern chemical function. Here, we introduce a deep generative modeling framework that accelerates sampling of molecular dynamics by four orders of magnitude while retaining physical realism. Applied to small organic molecules and peptides, the approach enables quantitative characterization of equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes that were previously only accessible by costly brute-force simulation. Importantly, the method generalizes across chemical composition and system size, extrapolating to peptides larger than those used for training, and captures chemically meaningful transitions on extended time scales. By expanding the accessible range of molecular motions without sacrificing atomistic detail, this approach opens new opportunities for probing conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in systems central to chemistry and biophysics.</description>

      <title>Graphene nanowindows as a basis for creating mechanically robust nanohydroxyapatite bone lamellar scaffolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of graphene nanowindows in the nanohydroxyapatite bone scaffold preparation is important for the preparation of mechanically robust scaffolds and implementation in bone recovery. Here, we report a graphene-nanohydroxyapatite (G-nHAP) scaffold synthesized by the hydrothermal method, along with its formation mechanism and promising in vivo applications. The G-nHAP scaffold exhibits excellent mechanical strength comparable to that of cancellous bone. The nHAP was grown on 2D layers of graphene with nanowindows. The role of nanowindows was to attract electrostatically Ca2+, PO43+, and OH- precursors of nHAP, forming a layered structure of G-nHAP, in which nHAP nanorods of 23.8 nm in diameter and 84.7 nm in length were placed between graphene layers, as evidenced with molecular dynamic simulations. In vivo study showed mature and mineralized bone and osteoid after six weeks. This demonstrates the role of graphene nanowindows in the formation of nHAP scaffolds that are promising for future implementation in bone tissue regeneration.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Chlorine Substitution on Rotational Speed and Light Absorption of Second Generation Molecular Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of substituting a hydrogen atom by a chlorine atom or a methyl group by a trichloromethyl (CCl3) group at the stereogenic center of light-driven second genera- tion molecular motors is calculated in order to assess the effect on rotational speed and the separation of the absorption peaks of the isomers. While experimental and theoret- ical studies have previously been carried out for fluorine substitution, this is the first study of chlorine substitution. Five well-characterized base molecules are studied and the trends are compared with the effect of fluorine substitution. The trichloromethyl substitution is found to accelerate the rotation more than a trifluoromethyl (CF3) sub- stitution by reducing the life-time of the metastable state, due to larger steric hindrance in the metastable state than in the transition state for the thermal helix inversion (THI). A larger increase in the separation of the absorption peaks of the two isomers is also ob- tained. The Cl atom substitution, however, changes the energy landscape significantly, making the M isomer lower in energy than the P isomer, and raising the energy barrier for THI beyond that of the back transition, thus quenching the rotation.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Enhancement of Series-Connected Cross-Conjugated Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric response of single-molecule junctions composed of acyclic cross-conjugated molecules, including dendralene analogues and related iso-poly(diacetylene) (iso-PDA) motifs, in which node-possessing repeat units are connected in series. Using many-body quantum transport theory, we show that increasing the number of repeat units leaves the fundamental gap essentially unchanged while giving rise to a split-node spectrum whose cumulative broadening dramatically enhances the thermopower. This form of quantum enhancement can exceed other interference-based mechanisms, such as the coalescence of nodes into a supernode, suggesting new opportunities for scalable quantum-interference-based materials. Although illustrated here with cross-conjugated systems, the underlying principles apply broadly to series-connected architectures hosting multiple interference nodes. Finally, we evaluate the scaling of the electronic figure of merit ZT and the maximum thermodynamic efficiency. Together, these results highlight the potential for split-node-based materials to realize quantum-enhanced thermoelectric response.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion in Driven Electrolytes due to Hydrodynamic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour including two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady-states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.</description>

      <title>Data-Error Scaling Laws in Machine Learning on Combinatorial Mutation-prone Sets: Proteins and Small Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate trends in the data-error scaling laws of machine learning (ML) models trained on discrete combinatorial spaces that are prone-to-mutation, such as proteins or organic small molecules. We trained and evaluated kernel ridge regression machines using variable amounts of computational and experimental training data. Our synthetic datasets comprised i) two na\"ive functions based on many-body theory; ii) binding energy estimates between a protein and a mutagenised peptide; and iii) solvation energies of two 6-heavy atom structural graphs, while the experimental dataset consisted of a full deep mutational scan of the binding protein GB1. In contrast to typical data-error scaling laws, our results showed discontinuous monotonic phase transitions during learning, observed as rapid drops in the test error at particular thresholds of training data. We observed two learning regimes, which we call saturated and asymptotic decay, and found that they are conditioned by the level of complexity (i.e. number of mutations) enclosed in the training set. We show that during training on this class of problems, the predictions were clustered by the ML models employed in the calibration plots. Furthermore, we present an alternative strategy to normalize learning curves (LCs) and introduce the concept of mutant-based shuffling. This work has implications for machine learning on mutagenisable discrete spaces such as chemical properties or protein phenotype prediction, and improves basic understanding of concepts in statistical learning theory.</description>

      <title>Fine Tuning of the Rotational Rate of Light-Driven, Second Generation Molecular Motors by Fluorine Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relaxation time of several second generation molecular motors is analysed by calculating the minimum energy path between the metastable and stable states and evaluating the transition rate within harmonic transition state theory based on energetics obtained from density functional theory. Comparison with published experimental data shows remarkably good agreement and demonstrates the predictive capability of the theoretical approach. While previous measurements by Feringa and coworkers [Chem.\,Eur.\,J.\,(2017) 23, 6643] have shown that a replacement of the stereogenic hydrogen by a fluorine atom increases the relaxation time because of destabilization of the transition state for the thermal helix inversion, we find that a replacement of CH$_3$ by a CF$_3$ group at the same site shortens the relaxation time because of elevated energy of the metastable state without a significant shift in the transition state energy. Since these two fluorine substitutions have an opposite effect on the relaxation time, the two combined can provide a way to fine tune the rotational speed of a molecular motor.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Relativistic Coupled Cluster and Equation of Motion Coupled Cluster Quadratic Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of relativistic coupled cluster quadratic response theory (QR-CC), following our development of relativistic equation of motion coupled cluster quadratic response theory (QR-EOMCC) [X. Yuan et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 9248]. These codes, which can be used in combination with relativistic (2- and 4-component based) as well as non-relativistic Hamiltonians, are capable of treating both static and dynamic perturbations for electric and magnetic operators. We have employed this new implementation to revisit the calculation of static and frequency-dependent first hyperpolarizabilities of hydrogen halides (HX, X=F-Ts) and the Verdet constant of heavy noble gas atoms (Xe, Rn, Og) and of selected hydrogen halides (HF to HI), in order to investigate the differences and similarities of QR-CC and the more approximate QR-EOMCC. Furthermore, we have determined the relative importance of scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling to these properties, through a comparison of different Hamiltonians, and extended our calculations to superheavy element species (HTs for hyperpolarizabilities, Og for the Verdet constant). Our results show that as one moves towards the bottom of the periodic table, QR-EOMCC can yield rather different results (hyperpolarizabilities) or perform rather similarly (Verdet constant) to QR-CC. These results underscore the importance of further characterizing the performance of QR-EOMCC for heavy element systems.</description>

      <title>An optical centrifuge with zero rotational acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optical centrifuge is a laser pulse which enables controlled rotational excitation of molecules. Centrifuged molecules rotating with well-defined angular frequencies are ideal candidates to probe many-body quantum systems at the nanoscale. Because the interaction with the quantum environment increases the effective moment of inertia of the embedded molecular probes, the required rotational acceleration of the optical centrifuge must be lowered to accommodate adiabatic spinning. We demonstrate a new design of an optical centrifuge, based on the method of spectral focusing, which enables extremely low, down to zero, rotational accelerations. We discuss the potential of using such constant frequency centrifuge to investigate molecular rotation inside helium nanodroplets.</description>

Abstract: We develop a numerical approach based on the sinc basis set for first-principles electronic structure calculations in one-dimensional systems. The method exploits the inherent accuracy and non-local character of the sinc functions to handle long-range couplings effectively. As a proof of principle, we provide a computational study of a molecule in an optical cavity, with our code directly calculating the emergence of the energy level splitting in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Direct Synthesis of Metal Hydrides from Metal and Acids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reactive metals generally undergo hydrogen evolution rather than forming direct hydrides when reacting with acids. However, an alternative pathway that involves the direct insertion of atomic hydrogen into the metal lattice, analogous to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), can induce extreme localized stresses on the order of gigapascals (GPa). This mechanochemical process significantly promotes the formation of metal hydrides under high-stress conditions. Inspired by this mechanism, we synthesized at least 19 high-purity metal hydrides, including MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, CeH2, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, ZrH1.6, ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH, using bulk metal foils and sulfuric or oleic acid as hydrogen sources. Through high-pressure technique conducted at the GPa level using a diamond anvil cell (DAC), we introduce the pressure concepts Delta-Ph and Delta-Peq to elucidate the synthesis and stabilization mechanisms. Quantitative analysis across all 19 hydrides reveals that the criterion abs(Delta-Peq) greater than Delta-Pph is essential for successful acid-mediated hydride formation; conversely, when abs(Delta-Peq) less than Delta-Pph, hydrogen-induced brittle fracture occurs. This principle not only enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides such as LiH, but also explains failure mechanisms in metals like Fe. Ultimately, this work repurposes HE from a failure mechanism into a controlled tool for hydride synthesis.</description>
