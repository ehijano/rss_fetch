      <title>Double rotatory power reversal and continuous Kerr angle in bi-isotropic media with anomalous Hall current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate optical properties of bi-isotropic materials under the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of the axion electrodynamics. Four refractive indices associated with circularly polarized waves are achieved, implying circular birefringence with rotatory power (RP) endowed with double sign reversal, an exotic optical signature for chiral dielectrics. The Kerr rotation and ellipticity are analyzed, with an unusual observation of rotation angle deprived of discontinuity. Anomalous reflection (greater than unity) is also reported, associated with negative refraction stemming from the anomalous transport properties. These effects constitute the singular optical signature of a bi-isotropic media with the AHE.</description>

      <title>Looking for optimal materials for whispering gallery modes applications at the 2 $\mu$m window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diverse applications of whispering gallery modes in spherical microresonators are strongly related to the sphere size and material composition. Their design should therefore be optimized to ensure that parameters such as the quality factor and the free spectral range are maximized. Because of the imminent capacity crisis of the optical communication systems operating at the 1550 nm wavelength regime, it is time to explore optical communications at the 2 $\mu\mbox{m}$ wavelength window. In this work, we analytically investigate key resonator parameters - quality factor and free spectral range - as a function of wavelength, aiming to establish a methodology to help identify optimal materials for whispering gallery mode sensors, with special attention at the 2 $\mu\mbox{m}$ wavelength window. Specifically, we examine three materials: fused silica, AsSe chalcogenide glass and calcium fluoride, and we perform a comparison between them in order to identify the region in the parameter space of resonant wavelengths and sphere radius, $(\lambda_R,R$), where the WGM resonators are optimal at wavelengths $1.8 \mu\mbox{m}&lt;\lambda&lt;2.1 \mu\mbox{m}$.</description>

      <title>Tunable ultraviolet dispersive-wave emission driven directly by 40-fs Ti: sapphire laser pulses in hollow capillary fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that by using 1-m-long gas-filled hollow capillary fiber (HCF) with a core diameter of 100 {\mu}m, tunable ultraviolet (UV) dispersive-wave (DW) pulses can be generated in a compact, single-stage set-up driven directly by 40-fs Ti: sapphire laser pulses. By adjusting the gas type and pressure inside the HCF, the central wavelength of the UV DW can be continuously tuned from 185 nm to ~450 nm. In the experiment, we found that for longer-wavelength (from ~320 to ~450 nm) DW generation, Raman-active gas filled in the HCF can efficiently suppress the pulse splitting effect of the high-order soliton due to the Raman-induced pulse energy dissipation, leading to the high-quality DW generation at these wavelengths with smooth, single-peak spectra. These results provide some useful insights for designing compact, wavelength-tunable ultrafast UV light sources with microjoule-level pulse energies.</description>

      <title>Tunable optical amplification and group delay in cavity magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically investigate the controllable output probe transmission and group delay in a hybrid cavity magnomechanics (CMM) system. The setup comprises a gain (active) cavity and a passive (loss) cavity, which incorporates an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and two yttrium iron garnet spheres to facilitate magnon-photon coupling. Unlike the single transparency window typically resulting from magnon-photon interactions, we also observe magnomechanically induced transparency due to nonlinear magnon-phonon interactions. Additionally, two absorption dips on either side of the central absorption dip can be asymmetrically modulated into amplification and absorption by varying different system parameters. A PT-symmetric to broken-PT-symmetric phase transition is observed in both balanced and unbalanced gain-to-loss scenarios. Notably, replacing the second passive cavity with an active one mitigates high absorption and introduces effective gain into the system. Our findings reveal that the group delay of the probe light can be adjusted between positive and negative values by modifying various system parameters. This study provides a robust platform for controlling light propagation in CMM systems, highlighting potential applications in optical communication and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Laplacian Inversion in Fokker-Planck Image Retrieval using the Transport-of-Intensity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray attenuation, phase, and dark-field images provide complementary information. Different experimental techniques can capture these contrast mechanisms, and the corresponding images can be retrieved using various theoretical algorithms. Our previous works developed the Multimodal Intrinsic Speckle-Tracking (MIST) algorithm, which is suitable for multimodal image retrieval from speckle-based X-ray imaging (SBXI) data. MIST is based on the X-ray Fokker-Planck equation, requiring the inversion of derivative operators that are often numerically unstable. These instabilities can be addressed by employing regularization techniques, such as Tikhonov regularization. The regularization output is highly sensitive to the choice of the Tikhonov regularization parameter, making it crucial to select this value carefully and optimally. Here, we present an automated iterative algorithm to optimize the regularization of the inverse Laplacian operator in our most recently published MIST variant, addressing the operator's instability near the Fourier-space origin. Our algorithm leverages the inherent stability of the phase solution obtained from the transport-of-intensity equation for SBXI, using it as a reliable ground truth for the more complex Fokker-Planck-based algorithms that incorporate the dark-field signal. We applied the algorithm to an SBXI dataset collected using synchrotron light of a four-rod sample. The four-rod sample's phase and dark-field images were optimally retrieved using our developed algorithm, eliminating the tedious and subjective task of selecting a suitable Tikhonov regularization parameter. The developed regularization-optimization algorithm makes MIST more user-friendly by eliminating the need for manual parameter selection. We anticipate that our optimization algorithm can also be applied to other image retrieval approaches derived from the Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <title>Dihedral beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a group theory-based formulation that introduces new classes of dihedral-symmetric beams is presented. Our framework leverages the algebraic properties of the dihedral group of rotations and reflections to transform input beams into closed-form families of dihedral-invariant wavefields, which will be referred to as dihedral beams. Each transformation is associated with a specific dihedral group in such a way that each family of dihedral beams exhibits the symmetries of its corresponding group. Our approach is inspired by one of the outcomes of this work: elegant Hermite-Gauss beams can be described as a dihedral interference pattern of elegant traveling waves, a new set of solutions to the paraxial equation also developed in this paper. Particularly, when taking elegant traveling waves as input beams, they transform into elegant dihedral beams possessing quasi-crystalline properties and including features like phase singularities, self-healing, and pseudo-nondiffracting propagation, as well as containing elegant Hermite and Laguerre-Gauss beams as special cases. Our approach can be applied to arbitrary scalar and vector input beams and constitutes a general group-theory formulation that can be extended beyond the dihedral group.</description>

      <title>High-Dynamic Range Broadband Terahertz Time-Domain Spectrometer Based on Organic Crystal MNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high power and broadband THz-TDS setup utilizing the nonlinear organic crystal MNA both as emitter and detector. The THz source is based on optical rectification of near infra-red laser pulses at a central wavelength of 1036 nm from a commercial, high-power Yb-based laser system and reaches a high THz average power of 11 mW at a repetition rate of 100 kHz and a broad and smooth bandwidth of more than 9 THz. The conversion efficiency is high (0.13%) in spite of the high excitation average power of 8 W. We validate the high dynamic range and reliability of the source for applications in linear spectroscopy by measuring the broadband THz properties of chi(2) nonlinear crystals up to 8 THz. This new high-repetition rate source is very promising for ultra-broadband THz spectroscopy at high dynamic range and/or reduced measurement times.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of Transverse Orientation Patterned Gallium Phosphide waveguides for high efficiency second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high conversion efficiencies in second-order nonlinear optical processes is a key challenge in integrated photonics for both classical and quantum applications. This paper presents the first demonstration of Transverse Orientation-Patterned gallium phosphide (TOP-GaP) waveguides showing high-efficiency second harmonic generation. In such devices, first order modal phase matching is unlocked and optimized through the inversion of the nonlinear susceptibility along the vertical direction. We discuss here the theory behind modal phase matching in TOP structures, describe the fabrication process, and present linear and nonlinear characterizations of the TOP-GaP waveguides.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a photonic lantern spatial demultiplexer based receiver for optical communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method based on a modal decomposition to quantify the efficiency of photonic lanterns (PL) based free space optical (FSO) communication receivers. We fabricate a seven port PL and we evaluate numerically the free space to fiber coupling efficiency based on a reconstruction of the fields at the PL FSO multimode port. We validate the numerical approach with an experimental characterization of the PL. Then we compare the PL to a commercial multiplane light converter spatial demultiplexer. The PL shows better coupling efficiency for low order spatial modes with orders of magnitude of demultiplexer size reduction. Finally we evaluate the PL receiver with a simulation of received optical wavefront in a FSO communication</description>

      <title>Up-Converting Luminescent Nanoparticles as Probes of Surface Dynamics in Single Evaporating Microdroplets of Suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the optically measurable properties of single evaporating microdroplets of suspensions containing up-converting luminescent nanoparticles (Gd2O3:Er3+), levitated in a linear electrodynamic trap. These microdroplets served as spherical optical resonators, with their resonance properties influenced by the distribution and interactions of nanoparticles (NPs) acting as nanoprobes. Using a combination of light scattering theories, we examined the evolution of the microdroplet radius, nanoparticle surface organization, and effective refractive index during evaporation. Up-conversion luminescence, driven by 805 nm excitation, enhanced the resolution of these observations. Key findings reveal that the increasing NP density in the surface layer leads to surface saturation, followed by transitions to a gel-like state through successive layer formation and collapse. Scattering and luminescence signals exhibit complex oscillatory behaviors linked to resonance phenomena and nanoparticle migration driven by photophoretic forces. Theoretical modeling closely aligns with experimental trends, confirming the interplay between NP distribution and optical resonance properties.</description>

      <title>Electronic readout of optically excited surface plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging thermal losses as a useful consequence of surface plasmons in metal nanostructures has gained traction in recent years. This thermalization of hot electrons also induces a resistance change to an applied bias current, which we use to realize an all electronic readout of surface plasmons. The interplay of the plasmonic k-vector dependence and the applied bias current allows us to distinguish between linear polarizations of an incident laser beam for polarimetry and polarization imaging uses. This illustrates the potential applications this technique offers as a fully CMOS compatible plasmonic sensor. Moreover, we demonstrate an electronic signal that depends on the delay between two laser pulses on ultrafast timescales, providing insight into the highly non-equilibrium dynamics of the hot electron distribution inside the metal. Using an electronic approach to surface plasmons broadens access and simplifies existing applications, while simultaneously opening the door to new pathways for developing integrated sensors for processes on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Collective single-photon emission and energy transfer in thin-layer dielectric and plasmonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective photon decay of multiple quantum emitters embedded in a thin high-index dielectric layer such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with and without a metal substrate. We first explore the significant role that guided modes including surface plasmon modes play in the collective decay of identical singlephoton emitters (super- and subradiance). Surprisingly, on distances relevant for collective emission, the guided or surface-plasmon modes do not always enhance the collective emission. We identify configurations with inhibition, and others with enhancement of the dipole interaction due to the guided modes. We interpret our results in terms of local and cross densities of optical states. In the same structure, we show a remarkably favorable configuration for enhanced F\"orster resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor in the dielectric layer on a metallic substrate. We compare our results to theoretical limits for energy transfer efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light waves possess multiple degrees of freedom besides intensity, including phase and polarization, that often contain important information but require complex and bulky systems for their measurement. Here we report a pair of compact multifunctional photodetectors that can selectively measure the local phase gradient of, respectively, the right and left circular-polarization component of any incident wave. These devices employ a chiral pair of integrated plasmonic metasurfaces to introduce a sharp dependence of responsivity on local direction of propagation of the desired polarization component. An order-of-magnitude polarization selectivity with respect to phase gradient is demonstrated with both devices. Using the measured device characteristics, we also describe computationally a pixel array that allows for the simultaneous separate mapping of the right and left circularly-polarized incident wavefronts in a particularly simple imaging setup. These unique capabilities may be exploited to enable new functionalities for applications in chemical sensing, biomedical microscopy, and machine vision.</description>

      <title>Abelian Spectral Topology of Multifold Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological phases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among the most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological properties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies (EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only recently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and concomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically fundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an open question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological classification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries, generalize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity relations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local symmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms of the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its derivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is understood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of (Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence, and iii) the classification of vector bundles. Our work reveals the mathematical foundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the theoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will therefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and quantum physics.</description>

Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel interference plays a vital role in many quantum optical applications where indistinguishability of two photons is important. Such photon pairs are commonly generated as the signal and idler in the frequency and polarization-degenerate spontaneous parametric down conversion~(SPDC). To scale this approach to a larger number of photons we demonstrate how two independent signal photons radiated into different spatial modes can be rendered conditionally indistinguishable by a heralding measurement performed on their respective idlers. We use the SPDC in a whispering gallery resonator, which is already proven to be versatile sources of quantum states. Its extreme conversion efficiency allowed us to perform our measurements with only \qty{50}{nW} of in-coupled pump power in each propagation direction. The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two counter-propagating signal photons manifested itself in the four-fold coincidence rate, where the two idler photons detection heralds a pair of signal photons with a desired temporal overlap. We achieved the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip contrast of \(74\pm 5\%\). Importantly, the optical bandwidth of all involved photons is of the order of a MHz and is continuously tunable. This, on the one hand, makes it possible to achieve the necessary temporal measurements resolution with standard electronics, and on the other hand, creates a quantum states source compatible with other candidates for qubit implementation, such as optical transitions in solid-state or vaporous systems. We also discuss the possibility of generating photon pairs with similar temporal modes from two different whispering gallery resonators.</description>

      <title>Coherent Interactions of Free Electrons and Matter: Toward Tunable Compact X-ray Sources</title>

Abstract: Compact laboratory-scale X-ray sources still rely on the same fundamental principles as in the first X-ray tubes developed more than a century ago. In recent years, significant research and development have focused on large-scale X-ray sources such as synchrotrons and free-electron lasers, leading to the generation of high-brightness coherent X-rays. However, the large size and high costs of such sources prevent their widespread use. The quest for a compact and coherent Xray source has long been a critical objective in modern physics, gaining further importance in recent years for industrial applications and fundamental scientific research. Here, we review the physical mechanisms governing compact coherent X-ray generation. Of current interest are coherent periodic interactions of free electrons in crystalline materials, creating hard X-rays via a mechanism known as parametric X-ray radiation (PXR). Over the past decade, X-ray sources leveraging this mechanism have demonstrated state-of-the-art tunability, directionality, and broad spatial coherence, enabling X-ray phase-contrast imaging on a compact scale. The coming years are expected to show substantial miniaturization of compact X-ray sources, facilitated by progress in electron beam technologies. This review compares the most promising mechanisms used for hard-X-ray generation, contrasting parametric X-ray radiation with inverse Compton scattering and characteristic radiation from a liquid-jet anode. We cover the most recent advancements, including the development of new materials, innovative geometrical designs, and specialized optimization techniques, aiming toward X-ray flux levels suitable for medical imaging and X-ray spectroscopy in compact scales.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical dark-mode-breaking cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical cooling of multiple degenerate mechanical modes is prevented by the mechanical dark mode due to destructive interference. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of simultaneous cooling of two near-degenerate mechanical modes by breaking the mechanical dark mode in a two-membrane cavity optomechanical system. The dark mode is generated as the system passes the exceptional point of the antiparity-time symmetric scheme. By introducing a second cavity mode for the additional dissipative channel, the dark mode is broken and the total phonon number is reduced by more than an order of magnitude below the dark mode cooling limit. Owing to the flexible tunability of the optomechanical coupling rates of such a four-mode coupled system, the optimized cooling efficiency can be achieved by investigating different parameter ranges. Our results provide an important step towards the ground state cooling and entanglement among multiple degenerate mechanical resonators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of multipulse solutions in mode-locked lasers in presence of time-delayed feedback stemming, e.g., from reflections upon optical elements, and carrier dynamics. We demonstrate that the dynamics of such a high dimensional problem can be successfully described by some effective equations of motion for the pulses' phases and positions. Analyzing the reduced vector field permits disclosing a highly complex dynamics where coherent and incoherent interactions compete. The latter lead to regimes in which pulses can be equidistant or non-equidistant and also have different phase relations. Multi-stability between regimes is also observed as well as emerging limit cycles and global heteroclinic bifurcations in phase space.</description>

Abstract: The generation of robust entanglement in quantum system arrays is a crucial aspect of the realization of efficient quantum information processing. Recently, the field of quantum magnonics has garnered significant attention as a promising platform for advancing in this direction. In our proposed scheme, we utilize a one-dimensional array of coupled cavities, with each cavity housing a single yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to the cavity mode through magnetic dipole interaction. To induce entanglement between YIGs, we employ a local squeezed reservoir, which provides the necessary nonlinearity for entanglement generation. Our results demonstrate the successful generation of bipartite and tripartite entanglement between distant magnon modes, all achieved through a single quantum reservoir. Furthermore, the steady-state entanglement between magnon modes is robust against magnon dissipation rates and environment temperature. Our results may lead to applications of cavity-magnon arrays in quantum information processing and quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Chiro-Optical Structures with Magnetizable Plasmonic Elements for Modulating the Chiral Transmission of Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulating external stimuli is crucial for enhancing and controlling the optical response in chiral structures. This study introduces chiral structures composed of single, dimer, or trimer arrays of plasmonic and magneto-plasmonic trapezoidal and triangular nanoantennas. Through modeling, we demonstrate how these systems can (i) function as chiral metasurfaces, (ii) modulate chiral light absorption via an external magnetic field, (iii) magnetically enhance the chiro-optical response, and (iv) improve the chiro-optical and magneto-chiral response through structural engineering. By optimizing the nanoantenna geometry, we achieve enhancements larger than 100 in the chiro-optical signal of a magnetized Ni monomer compared to a non-magnetized system. Additionally, we model bimetallic systems, showing a ~2-fold increase in chiro-optical response for hybrid Au and Ni magneto-plasmonic systems compared to purely plasmonic Au systems, while simultaneously enabling magnetic tuning of the optical response. Our results highlight the potential of structurally engineered magneto-plasmonic nanoantennas for advanced applications in chiro-optical sensing and tunable photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Single Exposure Quantitative Phase Imaging with a Conventional Microscope using Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase imaging is gaining importance due to its applications in fields like biomedical imaging and material characterization. In biomedical applications, it can provide quantitative information missing in label-free microscopy modalities. One of the most prominent methods in phase quantification is the Transport-of-Intensity Equation (TIE). TIE often requires multiple acquisitions at different defocus distances, which is not always feasible in a clinical setting. To address this issue, we propose to use chromatic aberrations to induce the required through-focus images with a single exposure, effectively generating a through-focus stack. Since the defocus distance induced by the aberrations is small, conventional TIE solvers are insufficient to address the resulting artifacts. We propose Zero-Mean Diffusion, a modified version of diffusion models designed for quantitative image prediction, and train it with synthetic data to ensure robust phase retrieval. Our contributions offer an alternative TIE approach that leverages chromatic aberrations, achieving accurate single-exposure phase measurement with white light and thus improving the efficiency of phase imaging. Moreover, we present a new class of diffusion models that are well-suited for quantitative data and have a sound theoretical basis. To validate our approach, we employ a widespread brightfield microscope equipped with a commercially available color camera. We apply our model to clinical microscopy of patients' urine, obtaining accurate phase measurements.</description>

      <title>Optical RISs Improve the Secret Key Rate of Free-Space QKD in HAP-to-UAV Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) are proposed for employment on building rooftops to facilitate free-space quantum key distribution (QKD) between highaltitude platforms (HAPs) and low-altitude platforms (LAPs). Due to practical constraints, the communication terminals can only be positioned beneath the LAPs, preventing direct upward links to HAPs. By deploying ORISs on rooftops to reflect the beam arriving from HAPs towards LAPs from below, reliable HAP-to-LAP links can be established. To accurately characterize the optical beam propagation, we develop an analytical channel model based on extended Huygens-Fresnel principles for representing both the atmospheric turbulence effects and the hovering fluctuations of LAPs. This model facilitates adaptive ORIS beam-width control through linear, quadratic, and focusing phase shifts, which are capable of effectively mitigating the detrimental effects of beam broadening and pointing errors (PE). Consequently, the information-theoretic bound of the secret key rate and the security performance of a decoy-state QKD protocol are analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that quadratic phase shifts enhance the SKR at high HAP-ORIS zenith angles or mild PE conditions by narrowing the beam to optimal sizes. By contrast, linear phase shifts are advantageous at low HAP-ORIS zenith angles or moderate-to-high PE by diverging the beam to mitigate LAP fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Covariance Analysis of Impulsive Streaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework of modeling covariance in angular streaking experiments. Within the impulsive streaking regime, the displacement of electron momentum distribution (MD) provides a tight connection between the dressing-free MD and the dressed MD. Such connection establishes universal structures in the composition of streaking covariance that are common across different MDs, regardless of their exact shape. Building on this robust framework, we have developed methods for retrieving temporal information from angular streaking measurements. By providing a detailed understanding of the covariance structure in angular streaking experiments, our work enables more accurate and robust temporal measurements in a wide range of experimental scenarios.</description>
