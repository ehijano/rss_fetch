      <title>Surface plasmon-mediated photoluminescence boost in graphene-covered CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of graphene (Gr)-covered CsPbBr$_3$  quantum dots (QDs) were investigated using micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy, revealing a remarkable three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in photoluminescence (PL) intensity compared to bare CsPbBr$_3$  QDs. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we combined experimental techniques with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT simulations showed that the graphene layer generates interfacial electrostatic potential barriers when in contact with the CsPbBr$_3$  surface, impeding carrier leakage from perovskite to graphene and enhancing radiative recombination. Additionally, graphene passivates CsPbBr$_3$  surface defect states, suppressing nonradiative recombination of photo-generated carriers. Our study also revealed that graphene becomes n-doped upon contact with CsPbBr$_3$  QDs, activating its plasmon mode. This mode resonantly couples with photo-generated excitons in the perovskite. The momentum mismatch between graphene plasmons and free-space photons is resolved through plasmon scattering at Gr/CsPbBr$_3$  interface corrugations, facilitating the observed super-bright emission. These findings highlight the critical role of graphene as a top contact in dramatically enhancing CsPbBr$_3$  QDs' PL. Our work advances the understanding of graphene-perovskite interfaces and opens new avenues for designing high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. The multifaceted enhancement mechanisms uncovered provide valuable insights for future research in nanophotonics and materials science, potentially leading to breakthroughs in light-emitting technologies.</description>

      <title>Reentrant polar phase induced by the ferro-ionic coupling in Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12856v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the model of four sublattices, the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire-Kittel phenomenological approach and the Stephenson-Highland ionic adsorption model for the description of coupled polar and antipolar long-range orders in ferroics, we calculated analytically the phase diagrams and polar properties of Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles covered by surface ions in dependence on their size, surface ions density, samarium content "x" and temperature. The size effects and ferro-ionic coupling govern the appearance and stability conditions of the long-range ordered ferroelectric, reentrant ferrielectric and antiferroelectric phases in the Bi1-xSmxFeO3 nanoparticles. Calculated phase diagrams are in a qualitative agreement with the X-ray diffraction phase analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, infra-red spectroscopy and electrophysical measurements of the Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanopowders sintered by the solution combustion method. The combined theoretical-experimental approach allows to establish the influence of the ferro-ionic coupling and size effects in Bi$_{1-x}$Sm$_x$FeO$_3$ nanoparticles on their polar properties.</description>

      <title>Identifying band structure changes of FePS3 across the antiferromagnetic phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic 2D materials enable novel tuning options of magnetism. As an example, the van der Waals material FePS3, a zigzag-type intralayer antiferromagnet, exhibits very strong magnetoelastic coupling due to the different bond lengths along different ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling directions enabling elastic tuning of magnetic properties. The likely cause of the length change is the intricate competition between direct exchange of the Fe atoms and superexchange via the S and P atoms. To elucidate this interplay, we study the band structure of exfoliated FePS3 by mu m scale ARPES (Angular Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy), both, above and, for the first time, below the Neel temperature TN. We find three characteristic changes across TN. They involve S 3p-type bands, Fe 3d-type bands and P 3p-type bands, respectively, as attributed by comparison with density functional theory calculations (DFT+U). This highlights the involvement of all the atoms in the magnetic phase transition providing independent evidence for the intricate exchange paths.</description>

      <title>Carrier Mobility of Strongly Anharmonic Materials from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principle approaches for phonon-limited electronic transport are typically based on many-body perturbation theory and transport equations. With that, they rely on the validity of the quasi-particle picture for electrons and phonons, which is known to fail in strongly anharmonic systems. In this work, we demonstrated the relevance of effects beyond the quasi-particle picture by combining ab initio molecular dynamics and the Kubo-Greenwood (KG) formalism to establish a non-perturbative, stochastic method to calculate carrier mobilities while accounting for all orders of anharmonic and electron-vibrational couplings. In particular, we propose and exploit several numerical strategies that overcome the notoriously slow convergence of the KG formalism for both electronic and nuclear degree of freedom in crystalline solids. The capability of this method is demonstrated by calculating the temperature-dependent electron mobility of the strongly anharmonic oxide perovskites SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 across a wide range of temperatures. We show that the temperature-dependence of the mobility is largely driven by anharmonic, higher-order coupling effects and rationalize these trends in terms of the non-perturbative electronic spectral functions.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical Cavity Expansion: A Novel Method for Characterizing the Mechanical Properties of Soft Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low elastic modulus of soft materials, combined with geometric nonlinearity and rate dependence, presents significant challenges in the characterization of their mechanical response. We introduce a novel method for measuring the mechanical properties of soft materials under large deformations via cylindrical cavity expansion. In this method, a cylindrical cavity is fabricated in the material and expanded by volume-controlled injection of an incompressible fluid with simultaneous measurement of the applied pressure at the cavity wall. The relationship between applied pressure and deformation at the cavity wall is then employed to characterize the nonlinear mechanical properties. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and validate it by measuring the mechanical properties of synthetic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and comparing with reported values in the literature. Results indicate that the cylindrical cavitation method effectively captures the response of PDMS over a wide range of stiffness (shear modulus ranging from 5 kPa to 300 kPa) and exhibit high repeatability. The proposed method overcomes limitations in characterization of ultra-soft materials using traditional testing methods, such as challenges with fabrication and clamping in unaxial tension testing and friction and adhesion effects in compression and indentation testing, thus enabling accurate and precise characterization. It also offers improved accuracy and repeatability over other needle induced cavity expansion methods due to precise control over the initial cavity dimension and shape at the cost of increased invasiveness of testing.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Hydrogen Atom Scattering Experiments Are Not a Sufficient Benchmark to Validate Electronic Friction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dynamics of atoms and molecules at metal surfaces, electron-hole pair excitations can play a crucial role. In the case of hyperthermal hydrogen atom scattering, they lead to nonadiabatic energy loss and highly inelastic scattering. Molecular dynamics with electronic friction simulations where friction is computed under an isotropic homogeneous electron gas approximation have previously shown good agreement with measured kinetic energy loss distributions, suggesting that this level of theoretical description is sufficient to describe nonadiabatic effects of atomic scattering. In this work, we show that similar agreement with room temperature experiments can also be achieved with friction derived from density functional theory linear response calculations. The apparent agreement of the homogeneous electron gas approximation with experiment arises from a fortuitous cancellation of errors where friction is overestimated close to the surface and the spin transition is neglected. Only for scattering at low temperatures can both approximations be distinguished and differences rationalised in terms of the number of bounces of the atom on the surface. We identify the signatures of nonadiabatic energy loss of different levels of theory, which future low-temperature scattering experiments will be able to measure.</description>

      <title>Zeoformer: Coarse-Grained Periodic Graph Transformer for OSDA-Zeolite Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12984v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, the International Zeolite Association Structure Commission (IZA-SC) has cataloged merely 255 distinct zeolite structures, with millions of theoretically possible structures yet to be discovered. The synthesis of a specific zeolite typically necessitates the use of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA), since the selectivity for a particular zeolite is largely determined by the affinity between the OSDA and the zeolite. Therefore, finding the best affinity OSDA-zeolite pair is the key to the synthesis of targeted zeolite. However, OSDA-zeolite pairs frequently exhibit complex geometric structures, i.e., a complex crystal structure formed by a large number of atoms. Although some existing machine learning methods can represent the periodicity of crystals, they cannot accurately represent crystal structures with local variability. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Zeoformer, which can effectively represent coarse-grained crystal periodicity and fine-grained local variability. Zeoformer reconstructs the unit cell centered around each atom and encodes the pairwise distances between this central atom and other atoms within the reconstructed unit cell. The introduction of pairwise distances within the reconstructed unit cell more effectively represents the overall structure of the unit cell and the differences between different unit cells, enabling the model to more accurately and efficiently predict the properties of OSDA-zeolite pairs and general crystal structures. Through comprehensive evaluation, our Zeoformer model demonstrates the best performance on OSDA-zeolite pair datasets and two types of crystal material datasets.</description>

      <title>Assessing the nature of nanoscale ferroelectric domain walls in lead titanate multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of unexpected polarisation textures such as vortices, skyrmions and merons in various oxide heterostructures has challenged the widely accepted picture of ferroelectric domain walls as being Ising-like. Bloch components in the 180{\deg} domain walls of PbTiO3 have recently been reported in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices and linked to domain wall chirality. While this opens exciting perspectives, the ubiquitous nature of this Bloch component remains to be further explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of domain walls in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices, involving a combination of first- and second-principles calculations, phase-field simulations, diffuse scattering calculations, and synchrotron based diffuse x-ray scattering. Our theoretical calculations highlight that the previously predicted Bloch polarisation in the 180{\deg} domain walls in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices might be more sensitive to the boundary conditions than initially thought and is not always expected to appear. Employing diffuse scattering calculations for larger systems we develop a method to probe the complex structure of domain walls in these superlattices via diffuse x-ray scattering measurements. Through this approach, we investigate depolarization-driven ferroelectric polarization rotation at the domain walls. Our experimental findings, consistent with our theoretical predictions for realistic domain periods, do not reveal any signatures of a Bloch component in the centres of the 180{\deg} domain walls of PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices, suggesting that the precise nature of domain walls in the ultrathin PbTiO3 layers is more intricate than previously thought and deserves further attention.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic sub-band splitting mechanisms in strained HgTe: a first principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mercury telluride is an intriguing compound that is well known for the first realization of topological states. Despite being known for a long time, a quantitative understanding of its electronic properties remains challenging due to the presence of many concomitant subtle effects. By combining accurate first principles calculations and $k.p$ modelling, we investigate the topological phase diagram of mercury telluride as a function of strain. Our research demonstrates the significance of including the linearly $k$-dependent higher-order $C_4$ strain terms into the usual $k.p$ treatment. In particular, we report a unique $k$-dependence of the sub-band splitting, which arises from the interplay between strain and the standard bulk inversion asymmetry terms within our $k.p$ model. The impact of this phenomenon is explored in relation to the camel's back shape during the tensile strain phase and its implications for the Weyl semimetal state in the compressive strain case are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sub-wavelength localized all-optical helicity-independent magnetic switching using plasmonic gold nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical helicity-independent switching (AO-HIS) is of interest for ultrafast and energy efficient magnetic switching in future magnetic data storage approaches. Yet, to achieve high bit density magnetic recording it is necessary to reduce the size of the magnetic bits addressed by laser pulses at well-controlled positions. Metallic nanostructures that support localized surface plasmons enable spatial electromagnetic confinement well below the diffraction limit and rare-earth transition metal alloys such as GdTbCo have demonstrated nanometre-sized stable domains. Here, we deposit plasmonic gold nanostructures on a GdTbCo film and probe the magnetic state using magnetic force microscopy. We observe localized AO-HIS down to a critical dimension of 240 nm after excitation of the gold nanostructures by a single 370 fs long laser pulse with a centre wavelength of 1030 nm. We demonstrate that the strong localization of optical fields through plasmonic nanostructures enables reproducible localized nanoscale AO-HIS at sub-wavelength length scales. We study the influence of the localized electromagnetic field enhancement by the plasmonic nanostructures on the required fluence to switch the magnetization.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of structural phase transformations during continuous phosphorus deposition on Cu(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue phosphorene -- two-dimensional, hexagonal-structured, semiconducting phosphorus -- has gained attention as it is considered easier to synthesize on metal surfaces than its allotrope, black phosphorene. Recent studies report different structures of phosphorene, for example, on Cu(111), but the underlying mechanisms of their formation are not known. Here, using a combination of in situ ultrahigh vacuum low-energy electron microscopy and in vacuo scanning tunneling microscopy, we determine the time-evolution of the surface structure and morphology during the deposition of phosphorus on single-crystalline Cu(111). We find that during early stages of deposition, phosphorus intermixes with Cu, resulting in copper phosphide structures. With increasing surface concentration of phosphorus, the phosphide phase disappears and a blue phosphorene layer forms, followed by self-assembly of highly ordered phosphorus clusters that eventually grow into multilayer islands. We attribute the unexpected transformation of stable phosphide to a phosphorene layer, and the previously unreported multilayer growth, to the presence of a large concentration of P2 dimers on the surface. Our results constitute direct evidence for a new growth mode leading to a phosphorene layer via an intermediary phase, which could underpin the growth of other 2D materials on strongly interacting substrates.</description>

      <title>EBSD and TKD analyses using inverted contrast Kikuchi diffraction patterns and alternative measurement geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns can exhibit Kikuchi bands with inverted contrast due to anomalous absorption. This can be observed, for example, on samples with nanoscale topography, in case of a low tilt backscattering geometry, or for transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) on thicker samples. Three examples are discussed where contrast-inverted physics-based simulated master patterns have been applied to find the correct crystal orientation. As the first EBSD example, self-assembled gold nanostructures made of Au fcc and Au hcp phases on single-crystal germanium were investigated. Gold covered about 12% of the mapped area, with only two-thirds being successfully interpreted using standard Hough-based indexing. The remaining third was solved by brute force indexing using a contrast-inverted master pattern. The second EBSD example deals with maps collected at a non-tilted surface instead of the commonly used 70 degree tilted one. As TKD example, a jet-polished foil made of duplex stainless steel 2205 was examined. The thin part close to the hole edge producing normal-contrast patterns were standard indexed. The areas of the foil that become thicker with increasing distance from the edge of the hole produce contrast-inverted patterns. They covered three times the evaluable area and were successfully processed using the contrast-inverted master pattern. In the last example, inverted patterns collected at a non-tiled sample were mathematically inverted to normal contrast, and Hough/Radon-based indexing was successfully applied.</description>

      <title>Time series forecasting of multiphase microstructure evolution using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructure evolution, which plays a critical role in determining materials properties, is commonly simulated by the high-fidelity but computationally expensive phase-field method. To address this, we approximate microstructure evolution as a time series forecasting problem within the domain of deep learning. Our approach involves implementing a cost-effective surrogate model that accurately predicts the spatiotemporal evolution of microstructures, taking an example of spinodal decomposition in binary and ternary mixtures. Our surrogate model combines a convolutional autoencoder to reduce the dimensional representation of these microstructures with convolutional recurrent neural networks to forecast their temporal evolution. We use different variants of recurrent neural networks to compare their efficacy in developing surrogate models for phase-field predictions. On average, our deep learning framework demonstrates excellent accuracy and speedup relative to phase-field simulations. Moreover, we use quantitative measures to demonstrate how surrogate model predictions can replace phase-field timesteps without compromising accuracy in the long-term evolution trajectory. Finally, by emulating a transfer learning approach, our framework performs satisfactorily in predicting new microstructures resulting from alloy composition and physics unknown to the model. As such, our approach demonstrates a useful data-driven alternative or accelerator to microstructure simulation workflow.</description>

      <title>Modeling scale-up of particle coating by atomic layer deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a promising technique to functionalize particle surfaces for energy applications including energy storage, catalysis, and decarbonization. In this work, we present a set of models of ALD particle coating to explore the transition from lab scale to manufacturing. Our models encompass the main particle coating manufacturing approaches including rotary bed, fluidized bed, and continuously vibrating reactors. These models provide key metrics, such as throughput and precursor utilization, required to evaluate the scalability of ALD manufacturing approaches and their feasibility in the context of energy applications. Our results show that designs that force the precursor to flow through fluidized particles transition faster to a transport-limited regime where throughput is maximized. They also exhibit higher precursor utilization. In the context of continuous processes, our models indicate that it is possible to achieve self-extinguishing processes with almost 100% precursor utilization. A comparison with past experimental results of ALD in fluidized bed reactors shows excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Theory of circular dichroism in angle- and spin-resolved photoemission from the surface state on Bi(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular dichroism (CD) of photoemission from a surface state on Bi(111) is considered
  within an {\it ab initio} one-step theory of photoemission. The symmetry of the azimuthal
  distribution of CD for different spin directions is discussed in terms of the spin structure
  of the initial states. Both normal and off-normal light incidence are considered. Strong
  photon energy dependence of photoemission in the ultraviolet range is observed. The principal
  difference between the initial state spin polarization and the spin photocurrent is emphasized
  and problems with revealing the orbital angular moment with photoemission are pointed to.</description>

      <title>Rules governing Jahn-Teller order in Prussian blue analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jahn-Teller distortions of transition-metal coordination environments link orbital occupancies to structure. In the solid state, such distortions can be strongly correlated through the propagation of strain and/or through orbital interactions. Cooperative Jahn-Teller (CJT) order of this kind affects the electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of the materials in which it occurs. Conventionally studied in dense ceramics, CJT order also occurs in hybrid materials, albeit the underlying phenomenology is not well established. Here we use synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction measurements to determine links between composition and Jahn-Teller effects in a series of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) families. We develop a simple model based on the dual considerations of strain and crystal-field stabilisation that can account for the stability, extent of CJT order, and crystallite strain measured experimentally. This model shows how PBA compositions might be tuned to control the emergence and nature of CJT effects. A key implication of the model is that PBAs harbour their own complex interplay between compositional, structural, orbital, and magnetic degrees of freedom related to that of strongly-correlated functional materials such as the manganite perovskites.</description>

      <title>Isolation and characterization of atomically thin mica phyllosilicates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the roadblocks to employing two-dimensional (2D) materials in next generation devices is the lack of high quality insulators. Insulating layered materials with inert and atomically flat surfaces are ideal for high performance transistors and this has been exemplified with commonly used boron nitride. While the list of insulating 2D materials is limited, the earth-abundant phyllosilicates are particularly attractive candidates. Here, we investigate the properties of atomically thin biotite and muscovite, the most common and commercially important micas from the rock-forming minerals. From a group of five natural bulk samples, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is used to classify exfoliated flakes into three types of biotite, including the phlogopite endmember, and two muscovites. We provide a catalog of RGB contrast values for exfoliated flakes ranging from bilayer to approximately 175 nm. Additionally, we report the complex index of refraction for all investigated materials based on micro-reflectance measurements. Our findings suggest that earth-abundant phyllosilicates could serve as scalable insulators for logic devices employing 2D materials, potentially overcoming current limitations in the field.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of supersymmetric spin and charge dynamics observed by inelastic neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry is an algebraic property of a class of quantum Hamiltonians, a guiding principle used in the development of nuclear theory and a concept that may underpin physics beyond the Standard Model. In condensed matter, any symmetry between bosonic and fermionic entities is usually strongly broken, as for the spin and charge sectors of the $t$-$J$ model describing the dynamics of fractionalized electrons in one-dimensional materials. While the triplet excitations of a quantum spin ladder in an applied magnetic field provide a close analogue of the $t$-$J$ chain, the supersymmetric nature of this system has not been explored. Here we perform neutron spectroscopy on the spin-ladder compounds (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuCl$_4$ over a range of applied fields and temperatures, and apply matrix-product-state (MPS) methods to the ladder and equivalent chain models, to analyse the full, momentum-resolved dynamics of a single charge excitation in a bath of fractionalized spins. We find a dramatic difference in the effects of thermal fluctuations, where strong and coherent shifts of spectral weight at the zone edge contrast with a strict pole at the zone centre, whose persistence at all temperatures constitutes an observable consequence of supersymmetry in a quantum spin ladder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of new materials in hard drive designs requires characterization of nanoscale materials through grain segmentation. The high-throughput quickly changing research environment makes zero-shot generalization an incredibly desirable feature. For this reason, we explore the application of Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to this problem. We first analyze the out-of-the-box use of SAM. Then we discuss opportunities and strategies for improvement under the assumption of minimal labeled data availability. Out-of-the-box SAM shows promising accuracy at property distribution extraction. We are able to identify four potential areas for improvement and show preliminary gains in two of the four areas.</description>

      <title>Progress in superconductor-semiconductor topological Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana bound states (MBSs) are quasiparticles which are their own antiparticles. They are predicted to emerge as zero-energy modes localized at the boundary of a topological superconductor. No intrinsic topological superconductor is known to date. However, by interfacing conventional superconductors and semiconductors with strong spin--orbit coupling it is possible to create a system hosting topological states. Hence epitaxial superconductors and semiconductors have emerged as an attractive materials system with atomically sharp interfaces and broad flexibility in device fabrications incorporating Josephson junctions. We discuss the basics of topological superconductivity and provide insight on how to go beyond current state-of-the-art experiments. We argue that the ultimate success in realizing MBS physics requires the observation of non-Abelian braiding and fusion experiments.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.</description>

      <title>Closing in on possible scenarios for infinite-layer nickelates: comparison of dynamical mean-field theory with angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conflicting theoretical scenarios for infinite-layer nickelate superconductors have been hotly debated, particularly regarding whether {only} a single Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is relevant at low energies besides electron pockets or whether multi-orbital physics including Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ is instead essential. The first scenario has emerged from density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Comparing the previous DFT+DMFT spectra to recent angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we find excellent agreement for both the Fermi surface and the strongly renormalized quasi-particle bands, supporting the first scenario. Our key findings further suggest that the "waterfalls" observed in ARPES might emerge from the quasi-particle--to--Hubbard-band crossover, and that additional spectral weight close to the $A$-pocket likely originates from the Ni-3$d_{xy}$ orbital.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Surface Oxides of Superconducting Circuits with Noble Metal Encapsulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lifetime of superconducting qubits is limited by dielectric loss, and a major source of dielectric loss is the native oxide present at the surface of the superconducting metal. Specifically, tantalum-based superconducting qubits have been demonstrated with record lifetimes, but a major source of loss is the presence of two-level systems (TLSs) in the surface tantalum oxide. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for avoiding oxide formation by encapsulating the tantalum with noble metals that do not form native oxide. By depositing a few nanometers of Au or AuPd alloy before breaking vacuum, we completely suppress tantalum oxide formation. Microwave loss measurements of superconducting resonators reveal that the noble metal is proximitized, with a superconducting gap over 80% of the bare tantalum at thicknesses where the oxide is fully suppressed. We find that losses in resonators fabricated by subtractive etching are dominated by oxides on the sidewalls, suggesting total surface encapsulation by additive fabrication as a promising strategy for eliminating surface oxide TLS loss in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study aimed at elucidating the complex magnetic correlations in Co$_2$TiSi$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$ Heusler alloy having the partial B2-type structure amid L2$_1$ cubic main phase. The thermo-magnetization measurements at 100 Oe reveal the presence of two magnetic transitions at T$\rm_{C1}=278~K$ and T$\rm_{C2}=270~K$, respectively, with saturation magnetization of around 1.2 $\mu \rm_ B$/f.u. at 5~K. Our magnetic field dependent studies reveal the dominance of T$\rm_{C1}$ transition at lower fields ($\mu_0\rm H \leqslant 0.03~Tesla$); however, at higher fields the T$\rm_{C2}$ transition becomes more pronounced. The observation of remnant magnetization above Curie temperature suggests the development of Griffiths-like phase, which is extensively analyzed through {\it ac} and {\it dc}- magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) data. The evaluation of magnetocaloric potential indicates second order phase transition with notable $\Delta S_{\rm M}=$ 2.22 Jkg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 7 Tesla. The low-field ($\mu_0\rm H \leqslant 0.1~Tesla$) magnetic entropy ($\Delta S_{\rm M}$) curves exhibit two non-identical positive peaks. The nature and range of spin interactions near T$\rm_C$ were scrutinized through rigorous critical phenomenon analysis, and the values of exponents $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and $\delta$ to be $0.063, 0.361, 1.108$ and $3.943$, respectively, which are found to be slightly deviating from mean-field theory towards 3D Heisenberg model. Additionally, the exchange magnetic interactions are found to decay as $J(r) \sim r^{-4.6}$. Furthermore, the density functional theory results reveal the half-metallic nature exhibiting 100\% spin polarization (SP). However, the electronic and magnetic properties are greatly affected by the incorporation of structural disorder, which results in drastic reduction of SP to mere 8.3\%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered granular matter exhibits mechanical responses that occupy the boundary between fluids and solids, lacking a complete description within a continuum theoretical framework. Recent studies have shown that, in the quasi-static limit, the mechanical response of disordered solids to external perturbations is anomalous and can be accurately predicted by the theory of odd-dipole-screening. In this work, we investigate responsive granular matter, where grains change size in response to stimuli such as humidity, temperature, or other factors. We develop a geometric theory of odd dipole-screening, incorporating the growth field into the equilibrium equation. Our theory predicts an anomalous displacement field in response to non-uniform growth fields, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations of granular matter. Although the screening parameters in our theory are phenomenological and not derived from microscopic physics, we identify a surprising relationship between the odd parameter and Poissons ratio. This theory has implications for various experimental protocols, including non-uniform heating or wetting, which lead to spatially varying expansion field.</description>

Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of emerging two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials, with control over their quantum geometries, crystal symmetries, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic anisotropies, provides a new platform for generating unconventional nonlinear Hall effects, spin polarization and efficiently controlling the magnetization dynamics for non-volatile spin-based computing. However, so far, the generation of a large out-of-plane spin polarization is limited to achieve energy-efficient field-free magnetization switching and spin dynamics measurements in all-2D vdW heterostructure are so far missing, where the interplay between spins and magnetization dynamics should enable the design of ultrafast spintronic devices. Here, we demonstrate magnetization dynamics and energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of out-of-plane magnet Fe3GaTe2 due to unconventional Berry curvature-induced out-of-plane spin polarization from a topological Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 in a vdW heterostructure at room temperature. We observed a large non-linear 2nd harmonic Hall signal at room temperature and evaluated the SOT-induced magnetization dynamics with a large damping-like torque. Deterministic field-free SOT magnetization switching in vdW heterostructure of TaIrTe4/Fe3GaTe2 is observed at room temperature with a low current and power density, which is an order of magnitude better than that of conventional systems. From the magnetization switching experiments, a large SOT efficiency and a very large spin Hall conductivity. These findings on all-vdW heterostructures offer a promising route to energy-efficient and external field-free ultrafast spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Instability in Ta2Pd3Te5 Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01222v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By systematic theoretical calculations, we have revealed an excitonic insulator (EI) in the Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer. The bulk Ta2Pd3Te5 is a van der Waals (vdW) layered compound, whereas the vdW layer can be obtained through exfoliation or molecular-beam epitaxy. First-principles calculations show that the monolayer is a nearly zero-gap semiconductor with the modified Becke-Johnson functional. Due to the same symmetry of the band-edge states, the two-dimensional polarization $\alpha_{2D}$ would be finite as the band gap goes to zero, allowing for an EI state in the compound. Using the first-principles many-body perturbation theory, the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation calculation reveals that the exciton binding energy is larger than the single-particle band gap, indicating the excitonic instability. The computed phonon spectrum suggests that the monolayer is dynamically stable without lattice distortion. Our findings suggest that the Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator without structural distortion.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic piezoelectricity of PZT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An unresolved issue in the commonly used Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3 (PZT) ceramics is understanding the intrinsic piezoelectric behaviors of its crystal around the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to grow c-axis oriented PZT around MPB on stainless steel SUS430, allowing us to estimate the intrinsic piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of PZT along its polar axis. The piezoelectric coefficient d33 and spontaneous polarization Ps were found to be 46.4 +- 4.4 pm/V, 88.7+-4.6 uC/cm2, respectively, for x = 0.47 close to MPB. These values align well with the predicted values of d33 = 50 - 55 pC/N and Ps=79 uC/cm2 at room temperature from the first-principles-derived approach. The obtained d33 is 4 times smaller than that of its ceramics, indicating that the large piezoelectric response in the PZT ceramics around MPB is primarily driven by extrinsic effects rather than intrinsic ones. In the technical application of PZT films, achieving a substantial piezoelectric response requires careful consideration of these extrinsic effects.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Atomic Structures on Faceted and Non-Flat Surfaces by Difference-of-Gaussians Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detailed analysis of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) data acquired for faceted and non-flat surfaces is usually complicated due to the presence of a large number of surface areas tilted by large/variable angles relative to the scanning plane. As a consequence, standard methods of elimination of global or local slopes by either a plane subtraction or numerical differentiation seem to be ineffective. We demonstrate that a simple difference-of-Gaussians procedure provides output data corresponding to projection of a considered surface onto the scanning plane without undesirable contrast modifications. This method allows us to suppress small-scale noise, minimize effects of finite slopes in the SPM images along both fast and slow scanning directions and removes surface ripples without active participation of the operator. This method can be applied for fast on-the-fly visualization of experimental data, and for more detailed analysis, including high-precision determination of lattice parameters and angles between translation vectors for surface reconstruction of different terraces or surface domains. In order to estimate geometrical distortions introduced by our procedure, we compare the results obtained by the difference-of-Gaussians approach for the tilted surfaces with direct image rotation in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have led to foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across diverse materials at reduced computational cost. These models are currently benchmarked on harmonic phonons and related quantities, leaving their reliability for complex, technologically relevant anharmonic heat-conduction properties uncertain. Here, we introduce a framework that leverages foundation models and the Wigner formulation of heat transport to automatically predict anharmonic vibrational properties and thermal conductivity in solids with arbitrary compositions and structures. We employ this framework with the foundation models M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, and SevenNET to analyze 103 diverse compounds, comparing predictions against first-principles references. Thus, we introduce a benchmark metric based on conductivity, and discuss data-efficient fine-tuning protocols to achieve first-principles accuracy. Our framework enables physics-aware, accurate predictions of vibrational and thermal properties, paving the way to discover materials that violate semiclassical Boltzmann transport and exhibit record-high heat-shielding or thermoelectric performance.</description>

      <title>High Strain Rate Compressive Deformation Behavior of Nickel Microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical properties of metals at extreme conditions is essential for the advancement of miniaturized technologies. As dimensions decrease, materials will experience higher strain rates at the same applied velocities. Moreover, the interplay effects of strain rates and temperatures are often overlooked and could have critical effects in applications. In this study, for the first time, the rate-dependent and temperature-dependent mechanical response of nickel microparticles have been investigated. The microparticles were obtained by solid-state dewetting of nickel thin films deposited on c-sapphire. They exhibit self-similar shapes with identical sets of planes, facilitating straightforward comparison between particles. This research represents the first in-depth analysis of the mechanical properties of nickel single crystal dewetted microparticles across six orders of magnitude at room temperature and three orders of magnitude at 128 K. Molecular dynamic simulations (MD) were conducted in parallel on particles with the same faceting. In this work, the gap between experiments and simulations has been reduced to over one order of magnitude in size and 3 orders of magnitude in the strain rates. The thermal activation parameter analysis and MD simulations were employed to ascertain whether homogeneous or heterogeneous dislocation nucleation was the dominant mechanism controlling deformation in the particles.</description>

      <title>Anomalous continuum scattering and higher-order van Hove singularity in the strongly anisotropic S = 1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The S = 1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) is a paradigmatic example of frustrated quantum magnetism. An ongoing challenge involves understanding the influence of exchange anisotropy on the collective behavior within such systems. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and advanced calculation techniques, we have studied the low and high-temperature spin dynamics of Ba2La2CoTe2O12 (BLCTO): a Co2+-based Jeff = 1/2 TLAF that exhibits 120{\deg} order below TN = 3.26 K. We determined the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the energy-resolved paramagnetic excitations measured at T &gt; TN, revealing exceptionally strong easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Below TN, the excitation spectrum exhibits a high energy continuum having a larger spectral weight than the single-magnon modes, suggesting a scenario characterized by a spinon confinement length that markedly exceeds the lattice spacing. We conjecture that this phenomenon arises from the proximity to a quantum melting point, even under strong easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Finally, we highlight characteristic flat features in the excitation spectrum, which are connected to higher-order van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion directly induced by easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Our results provide a rare experimental insight into the nature of highly anisotropic S = 1/2 TLAFs between the Heisenberg and XY limits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modelling of Magnetism in Strongly Correlated Materials: Evaluating Constrained DFT and the Hubbard Model for Y114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal compounds represent a fascinating playground for exploring the intricate relationship between structural distortions, electronic properties, and magnetic behaviour, holding significant promise for technological advancements. Among these compounds, YBaCo$_4$O$_{7}$ (Y114) is attractive due to its manifestation of a ferrimagnetic component at low temperature intertwined with distortion effect due to the charge disproportionation on Co ions, exerting profound impact on its magnetic properties. In this perspective paper, we study the structural and magnetic intricacies of the Y114 crystal using a novel first-principles methodology. Traditionally, the investigation of such materials has relied heavily on computational modelling using density-functional theory (DFT) with the on-site Coulomb interaction correction $U$ (DFT+$U$) based on the Hubbard model (sometimes including Hund's exchange coupling parameter $J$, DFT+$U$+$J$) to unravel their complexities. Herein, we analysed the spurious effects of magnetic-moment delocalisation and spillover to non-magnetic ions in the lattice on electronic structure and magnetic properties of Y114. To overcome this problem we have applied constrained DFT (cDFT) based on the potential self-consistency approach, and comprehensively explore the Y114 crystal's characteristics in its ferrimagnetic order. We find that cDFT yields magnetic moments of Co ions much closer to the experimental values than Hubbard model with the parameters $U$ and $J$ fitted to reproduce experimental lattice constants. cDFT allows for an accurate prediction of magnetic properties using oxidation states of magnetic ions as well-defined parameters. Through this perspective, we not only enhance our understanding of the magnetic interactions in Y114 crystal, but also pave the way for future investigations into magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Search for inhomogeneous Meissner screening in Nb induced by low-temperature surface treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical surface treatments, such as low-temperature baking (LTB) in a gaseous atmosphere or in vacuum, are important for the surface preparation of Nb superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. These treatments inhomogeneously dope the first $\sim$50 nm of Nb's subsurface and are expected to impart depth-dependent characteristics to its Meissner response; however, direct evidence supporting this remains elusive, suggesting the effect is subtle. In this work, we revisit the Meissner profile data for several LTB treatments obtained from low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\mu$SR) experiments [A. Romanenko et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 072601 (2014) and R. M. L. McFadden et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 044018 (2023)], and search for signatures of inhomogeneous field screening. Using a generalized London expression with a recently proposed empirical model for a depth-dependent magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(z)$, we obtain improved fits to the Meissner data, revealing that the presence of a non-superconducting surface "dead layer" $d \geq 25$ nm is a strong indicator of a reduced supercurrent density at shallow subsurface depths. Our analysis supports the notion that vacuum annealing at 120 $^{\circ}$C for 48 h induces a depth-dependent Meissner response, which has consequences for Nb's ability to maintain a magnetic-flux-free state. Evidence of similar behavior from a "nitrogen infusion" treatment is less compelling. Suggestions for further investigation into the matter are provided.</description>

      <title>Solving multi-pole challenges in the GW100 benchmark enables precise low-scaling GW calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation is a widely used method for computing electron addition and removal energies of molecules and solids. The computational effort of conventional $GW$ algorithms increases as $O(N^4)$ with the system size $N$, hindering the application of $GW$ to large and complex systems. Low-scaling $GW$ algorithms are currently very actively developed. Benchmark studies at the single-shot $G_0W_0$ level indicate excellent numerical precision for frontier quasiparticle energies, with mean absolute deviations $&lt;10$ meV between low-scaling and standard implementations for the widely used $GW100$ test set. A notable challenge for low-scaling $GW$ algorithms remains in achieving high precision for five molecules within the $GW100$ test set, namely O$_3$, BeO, MgO, BN, and CuCN, for which the deviations are in the range of several hundred meV at the $G_0W_0$ level. This is due to a spurious transfer of spectral weight from the quasiparticle to the satellite spectrum in $G_0W_0$ calculations, resulting in multi-pole features in the self-energy and spectral function, which low-scaling algorithms fail to describe. We show in this work that including eigenvalue self-consistency in the Green's function ($\text{ev}GW_0$) achieves a proper separation between satellite and quasiparticle peak, leading to a single solution of the quasiparticle equation with spectral weight close to one. $\text{ev}GW_0$ quasiparticles energies from low-scaling $GW$ closely align with reference calculations; the mean absolute error is only 12 meV for the five molecules. We thus demonstrate that low-scaling $GW$ with self-consistency in $G$ is well-suited for computing frontier quasiparticle energies.</description>
