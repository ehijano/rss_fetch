      <title>Anisotropy-Driven Quantum Level-Crossing in Spin-1 Heisenberg Dimers: Applications in Quantum Stirling Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic performance of a quantum Stirling heat engine implemented with an anisotropic spin-1 Heisenberg dimer as the working medium. Using the Hamiltonian of the system, we analyze the interplay of anisotropy, magnetic field, and exchange interactions and their influence on the energy spectrum and the quantum level crossing. Our results reveal that double-degenerate point (DDP) and a triple-degenerate point (TDP) play pivotal roles in shaping the operational regimes and efficiency of the quantum Stirling engine. At those points, the Carnot efficiency reaches higher work output and enhanced stability, making it a robust candidate for optimal thermodynamic performance. These findings highlight the potential of anisotropic spin systems as viable platforms for quantum heat engines and contribute to advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Strong-damping limit of quantum Brownian motion in a disordered environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a microscopic model of an inhomogeneous environment where an arbitrary quantum system is locally coupled to a harmonic bath via a finite-range interaction. We show that in the overdamped regime the position distribution obeys a classical Kramers-Moyal equation that involves an infinite number of higher derivatives, implying that the finite bath correlation length leads to non-Gaussian Markovian noise. We analytically solve the equation for a harmonically bound particle and analyze its non-Gaussian diffusion as well as its steady-state properties.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium fluctuation relations for non-Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise is omnipresent in systems where the central-limit theorem is inapplicable. We here investigate the stochastic thermodynamics of small systems that are described by a general Kramers-Moyal equation that includes both Gaussian and non-Gaussian white noise contributions. We obtain detailed and integral fluctuation relations for the nonequilibrium entropy production of these Markov processes in the regime of weak noise. As an application, we analyze the properties of driven objects that are locally coupled to a heat bath via a finite-range interaction, by considering an overdamped particle that is pulled by a moving harmonic potential. We find that reducing the bath interaction range increases non-Gaussian features, and strongly suppresses the average nonequilibrium entropy production. We further discuss a generalized detailed-balance condition.</description>

      <title>Breaking Performance Barriers: Massive-Scale Simulations of 2D Ising and Blume-Capel Models on Rack-Scale Multi-GPU Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-performance implementations of the two-dimensional Ising and Blume-Capel models for large-scale, multi-GPU simulations. Our approach takes full advantage of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system, which features up to $72$ GPUs interconnected via high-bandwidth NVLink, enabling direct GPU-to-GPU memory access across multiple nodes. By utilizing Fabric Memory and an optimized Monte Carlo kernel for the Ising model, our implementation supports simulations of systems with linear sizes up to $L=2^{23}$, corresponding to approximately $70$ trillion spins. This allows for a peak processing rate of nearly $1.15 \times 10^5$ lattice updates per nanosecond-setting a new performance benchmark for Ising model simulations. Additionally, we introduce a custom protocol for computing correlation functions, which strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. This protocol enables large-scale simulations without incurring prohibitive runtime costs. Benchmark results show near-perfect strong and weak scaling up to $64$ GPUs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for large-scale statistical physics simulations.</description>

      <title>Local Quenches from a Krylov Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate local quench dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theories using Krylov space methods. We derive Lanczos coefficients, spread complexity, and Krylov entropies for local joining and splitting quenches in theories on an infinite line, a circle, a finite interval, and at finite temperature. We examine how these quantities depend on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and find that both spread complexity and Krylov entropy are proportional to it. Interestingly, Krylov entropies evolve logarithmically with time, mirroring standard entanglement entropies, making them useful for extracting the central charge. In the large central charge limit, using holography, we establish a connection between the rate of spread complexity and the proper momentum of the tip of the end-of-the world brane, which probes the bulk analogously to a point particle. Our results further demonstrate that spread complexity and Krylov entropies are powerful tools for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum natural gradient with thermal-state initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are central to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), yet their performance is hindered by complex loss landscapes that make their trainability challenging. Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parameterized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed in [Stokes et al., Quantum 4, 269 (2020)], by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix-the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices-for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state.</description>

      <title>Long-range nonstabilizerness and phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range nonstabilizerness can be defined as the amount of nonstabilizerness which cannot be removed by shallow local quantum circuits. In this work, we study long-range nonstabilizerness in the context of many-body quantum physics, a task with possible implications for quantum-state preparation protocols and implementation of quantum-error correcting codes. After presenting a simple argument showing that long-range nonstabilizerness is a generic property of many-body states, we restrict to the class of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. We focus on one-dimensional systems and present rigorous results in the context of translation-invariant matrix product states (MPSs). By analyzing the fixed points of the MPS renormalization-group flow, we provide a sufficient condition for long-range nonstabilizerness, which depends entirely on the local MPS tensors. Physically, our condition captures the fact that the mutual information between distant regions of stabilizer fixed points is quantized, and this fact is not changed after applying shallow quantum circuits. We also discuss possible ramifications in the classification of phases of matter and quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring a quantum system can profoundly alter its dynamical properties, leading to nontrivial emergent phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate that dynamical measurements strongly influence the evolution of symmetry in many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that monitored systems governed by non-Hermitian dynamics exhibit a quantum Mpemba effect, where systems with stronger initial asymmetry relax faster to a symmetric state. Crucially, this phenomenon is purely measurement-induced: in the absence of measurements, we find states where the corresponding unitary evolution does not display any Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we uncover a novel measurement-induced symmetry restoration mechanism: below a critical measurement rate, the symmetry remains broken, but beyond a threshold, it is fully restored in the thermodynamic limit--along with the emergence of the quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Odd Active Solids: Vortices, Velocity Oscillations and Dissipation-Free Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of physical and biological systems, including colloidal magnets, granular spinners, and starfish embryos, are characterized by strongly rotating units that give rise to odd viscosity and odd elasticity. These active systems can be described using a coarse-grained model in which the pairwise forces between particles include a transverse component compared to standard interactions due to a central potential. These non-potential, additional forces, referred to as odd interactions, do not conserve energy or angular momentum and induce rotational motion. Here, we study a two-dimensional crystal composed of inertial Brownian particles that interact via odd forces and are in thermal contact with their environment. In the underdamped regime, the energy injected by odd forces can counteract dissipation due to friction, leading to quasi-dissipation-free excitations with finite frequency and wavelength. In the resulting non-equilibrium steady state, the system exhibits angular momentum and velocity correlations. When the strength of the odd forces exceeds a certain threshold or friction is too low, a crystal with only harmonic springs becomes linearly unstable due to transverse fluctuations. This instability can be mitigated by introducing nonlinear central interactions, which suppress the divergence of short-wavelength velocity fluctuations and allows us to numerically explore the linearly unstable regime. This is characterized by pronounced temporal oscillations in the velocity featuring the existence of vortex structures and kinetic temperature values larger than the thermal temperature.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Long-range Hard-wall Repulsion between Polymers in Solvent Mixtures and Its Implication for Biomolecular Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The system of polymers in solvent mixtures is a widely-used model to represent biomolecular condensates in intracellular environments. Here, we apply a variational theory to control the center-of-mass of two polymers and perform the first quantification of their interactions in solvent mixtures. Even both solvent and cosolvent are good to the polymer, we demonstrate that strong polymer-cosolvent affinity induces the formation of a single-chain condensate. Even though all the molecular interactions are soft, the potential of mean force between two condensates exhibits an anomalous feature of long-range hard-wall repulsion, which cannot be categorized into any existing types of inter-chain interactions. This repulsion is enhanced as either the affinity or the bulk cosolvent fraction increases. The underlying mechanism is cosolvent regulation manifested as a discontinuous local condensation of cosolvent. The hard-wall repulsion provides a kinetic barrier to prevent coalescence of condensates and hence highlights the intrinsic role of proteins as a cosolvent in stabilizing biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental constraint on work far beyond the adiabatic regime is crucial to investigating fast and efficient energy extraction or consumption processes. In this study, we derive thermodynamic speed limits for non-adiabatic work and quantify the fundamental costs of non-adiabatic work extraction or consumption processes in open quantum systems, where the costs are quantified by geometric and thermodynamic quantities. We further decompose the non-adiabatic work into classical and quantum contributions and derive their thermodynamic speed limits, clarifying the classical and quantum nature of the fundamental costs. The obtained results are numerically demonstrated by driven two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy dynamically witnesses many-body localized phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems which fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider initial-boundary value problems on a finite interval for the system of the energy balance equation and modified Fourier's law (constitutive equation, commonly called the Cattaneo equation) describing temperature (or internal energy) and heat flux. This hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations is the simplest model of non-Fourier heat conduction. Boundary conditions comprise various models of behavior of a physical system at the boundaries, including boundary conditions describing Newton's law, which states that the heat flux at the boundary is directly proportional to the difference in the temperature of the physical system and ambient temperature. In this case the boundary conditions express the relationship of unknown functions (temperature or internal energy and heat flux) with each other. To solve the problems, we apply the Fokas unified transform method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unknown node attributes in complex networks may introduce community structures that are important to distinguish from those driven by known attributes. We propose a block-corrected modularity that discounts given block structures present in the network to reveal communities masked by them. We show analytically how the proposed modularity finds the community structure driven by an unknown attribute in a simple network model. Further, we observe that the block-corrected modularity finds the underlying community structure on a number of simple synthetic network models while methods using different null models fail. We develop an efficient spectral method as well as two Louvain-inspired fine-tuning algorithms to maximize the proposed modularity and demonstrate their performance on several synthetic network models. Finally, we assess our methodology on various real-world citation networks built using the OpenAlex data by correcting for the temporal citation patterns.</description>

Abstract: We show how to efficiently compute asymptotically sharp estimates of extreme event probabilities in stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with small multiplicative Brownian noise. The underlying approximation is known as sharp large deviation theory or precise Laplace asymptotics in mathematics, the second-order reliability method (SORM) in reliability engineering, and the instanton or optimal fluctuation method with 1-loop corrections in physics. It is based on approximating the tail probability in question with the most probable realization of the stochastic process, and local perturbations around this realization. We first recall and contextualize the relevant classical theoretical result on precise Laplace asymptotics of diffusion processes [Ben Arous (1988), Stochastics, 25(3), 125-153], and then show how to compute the involved infinite-dimensional quantities - operator traces and Carleman-Fredholm determinants - numerically in a way that is scalable with respect to the time discretization and remains feasible in high spatial dimensions. Using tools from automatic differentiation, we achieve a straightforward black-box numerical computation of the SORM estimates in JAX. The method is illustrated in examples of SDEs and stochastic partial differential equations, including a two-dimensional random advection-diffusion model of a passive scalar. We thereby demonstrate that it is possible to obtain efficient and accurate SORM estimates for very high-dimensional problems, as long as the infinite-dimensional structure of the problem is correctly taken into account. Our JAX implementation of the method is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Lindbladians for Quantum Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Lindblad framework for quantum stochastic thermodynamics to study the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of open quantum systems. Our approach adopts the local quantum detailed balance condition, ensuring thermodynamic consistency and leading to a joint fluctuation theorem of quantum work and heat. Instead of solving the full evolution of the density matrix, we employ an effective parametrization to derive the full counting statistics of work and heat and determine the optimal protocols. As an application, we refine the quantum Brownian motion master equation to ensure the quantum detailed balance condition, derive the optimal protocols at different temperatures, and study the work statistics. Our framework provides fundamental insights and practical strategies for optimizing thermodynamic processes in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for the non-convex multispecies Curie-Weiss model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the generalized non-convex multispecies Curie-Weiss model, where interactions among different types of particles (forming the species) are encoded in a generic matrix. For spins with a generic prior distribution, we compute the pressure in the thermodynamic limit using simple interpolation techniques. For Ising spins, we further analyze the fluctuations of the magnetization in the thermodynamic limit under the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure. It is shown that a central limit theorem holds for a rescaled and centered vector of species magnetizations, which converges to either a centered or non-centered multivariate normal distribution, depending on the rate of convergence of the relative sizes of the species.</description>

      <title>Highly Entangled 2D Ground State: Tensor Network, Order Parameter and Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present analytical results on the exact tensor network representation, spin order parameter and color correlation function of the first example of 2D ground states with entanglement phase transitions from area law to extensive entanglement entropy. The tensor network constructed is one dimension higher than the lattice of the physical system, allowing entangled physical degrees of freedoms to be paired with one another arbitrarily far away. Contraction rules of the internal legs are specified by a simple translationally invariant set of rules in terms of the tesselation of cubes in 3D space. The network directly generalizes the previous holographic tensor networks for 1D Fredkin and Motzkin chains. We also analyze the order parameter of in the spin sector from the scaling of the height function of random surfaces, and the correlation in the color sector.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the term ``quantum chaos'' refers to spectral correlations similar to those found in the random matrix theory. Quantum chaos can be diagnosed through the analysis of level statistics using e.g.~the spectral form factor, which detects both short- and long-range level correlations. The spectral form factor corresponds to the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral correlation function and exhibits a typical slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure (aka correlation hole) when the system is chaotic. We discuss how this structure could be detected through the quench dynamics of two physical quantities accessible to experimental many-body quantum systems: the survival probability and the spin autocorrelation function. The survival probability is equivalent to the spectral form factor with an additional filter. When the system is small, the dip of the correlation hole reaches sufficiently large values at times which are short enough to be detected with current experimental platforms. As the system is pushed away from chaos, the correlation hole disappears, signaling integrability or localization. We also provide a relatively shallow circuit with which the correlation hole could be detected with commercially available quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Optimal number of agents in a collective search, and when to launch them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search processes often involve multiple agents that collectively search a randomly located target. While increasing the number of agents usually decreases the time at which the first agent finds the target, it also requires resources to create and sustain more agents. In this manuscript, we raise the question of the optimal timing for launching multiple agents in a search in order to reach the best compromise between minimizing the overall search time and minimizing the costs associated with launching and sustaining agents. After introducing a general formalism for independent agents in which we allow them to be launched at arbitrary times, we investigate by means of analytical calculations and numerical optimization the optimal launch strategies to optimize the quantiles of the search cost and its mean. Finally, we compare our results with the case of stochastic resetting and study the conditions under which it is preferable to launch new searchers rather than resetting the first one to its initial position.</description>

      <title>Exponential Change of Relaxation Rate by Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the asymptotic relaxation rate of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential perturbed by quenched Gaussian disorder, a simplified model for rugged energy landscapes in complex systems. Depending on the properties of the disorder, we show that the mean and variance of the asymptotic relaxation rate are non-monotonous functions of the parameters for a broad class of disorders. In particular, the rate of relaxation may either increase or decrease exponentially compared to the unperturbed case. This implies that disorder may, depending on its properties, both significantly speed up \textit{and} slow down relaxation. In the limit of weak disorder, we derive the probability distribution of the asymptotic relaxation rate and show that it is Gaussian, with analytic expressions for the mean and variance that feature universal limits. Our findings indicate that controlled disorder may serve to tune the relaxation speed in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, violation of Fourier's law, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a Seebeck-like effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active particles driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</description>

Abstract: The chromium spinels MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4 are prime examples of the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet. Experiment has carefully established that both materials, upon cooling, distort to lower symmetry and order magnetically. We study the nature of this process by a combination of density-functional-theory based energy mapping and classical Monte Carlo simulations. We first computationally establish precise Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameters for the high temperature cubic and the low temperature tetragonal and orthorhombic structures of both spinels. We then investigate the respective ordering temperatures of high symmetry and low symmetry structures. We carefully compare our results with experimental facts and find that our simulations are remarkably consistent with a type of spin-Peierls mechanism, adapted to three dimensions, where the structural distortion is mediated by a magnetic energy gain due to a lower degree of frustration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations are life-threatening hemodynamic pathologies of the brain. While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions or with modern noninvasive high-resolution imaging methods, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 \%}. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.</description>

      <title>Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta &lt; 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta &gt; 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Agnostic calculation of atomic free energies with the descriptor density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.</description>

Abstract: The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.</description>
