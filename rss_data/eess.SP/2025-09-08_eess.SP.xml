      <title>Developing a Framework to Simulate Quantitative Ultrasound Flow and Tissue Motion for Ultrafast Doppler Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast power Doppler imaging (uPDI) has made significant progress and become an important imaging method for both research and clinical implementations. While, it lacks simulation tools that can perform three-dimensional (3D) quantitative flow with tissue motion close to realistic conditions. In this study, we explore to construct an open-source framework, named 3D-Fully Quantitative Flow (3D-FQFlow), to provide quantitative modeling of 3D vascular flow with tissue motion and uPDI imaging. The framework integrates a L-system-based vascular generator with SimVascular CFD for hemodynamics, a tissue motion simulator supporting user-defined or clinical-data-driven condition, an optimized PFILED ultrasound simulator, a precomputed-matrix-based reconstructor, and a quantitative analyzer (MSE/PSNR/SSIM). Results demonstrate distinct influences of four motion patterns on SVD decomposition; successful 3D imaging of rabbit kidney (SSIM = 0.951), generated vasculature (SSIM = 0.902), and clinical pulmonary arteries (SSIM = 0.850); and GPU acceleration permitting 1-million-scatterer simulation in 4,117 seconds with 18.8* speedup for 100-frame 3D-uPDI generation. 3D-FQFlow establishes the first open-source framework for quantitative validation of uPDI under realistic vascular and motion conditions, creating a reproducible standard for microvascular imaging research (https://github.com/FortuneOU/3D-FQFlow).</description>

      <title>Time-Modulated Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Integrated Sensing, Communication and Security: A Generative AI Design Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to achieve physical layer security for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems operating in the presence of targets that may be eavesdroppers. The system is aided by a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS), which is configured to preserve the integrity of the transmitted data at one or more legitimate communication users (CUs) while making them appear scrambled in all other directions. The TM-IRS design leverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) framework to learn a stochastic policy that samples high-performing TM-IRS configurations from a vast discrete parameter space. Specifically, we begin by formulating the achievable sum rate for the legitimate CUs and the beampattern gain toward the target direction, based on which we construct reward functions for GFlowNets that jointly capture both communication and sensing performance. The TM-IRS design is modeled as a deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state corresponds to a complete configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets, parametrized by deep neural networks are employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their associated reward. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GFlowNet-based method in integrating sensing, communication and security simultaneously, and also exhibit significant sampling efficiency as compared to the exhaustive combinatorial search and enhanced robustness against the rule-based TM-IRS design method.</description>

      <title>Power-Measurement-Based Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), with its enhanced degrees of freedom compared to conventional RIS, has demonstrated notable potential for enhancing wireless communication performance. However, a key challenge in employing BD-RIS lies in accurately acquiring its channel state information (CSI) with both the base station (BS) and users. Existing BD-RIS channel estimation methods rely mainly on dedicated pilot signals, which increase system overhead and may be incompatible with current communication protocols. To overcome these limitations, this letter proposes a new single-layer neural network (NN)-enabled channel estimation method utilizing only the easily accessible received power measurements at user terminals. In particular, we show that the received signal power can be expressed in a form similar to a single-layer NN, where the weights represent the BD-RIS's CSI. This structure enables the recovery of CSI using the backward propagation, based on power measurements collected under varying training reflection coefficients. Numerical results show that our proposed method can achieve a small normalized mean square error (NMSE), particularly when the number of training reflections is large.</description>

      <title>Full-Angle Ray Antenna Array and Omnicell Wireless Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ray antenna array (RAA) was recently proposed as a novel multi-antenna architecture that arranges multiple massive cheap antenna elements into simple uniform linear arrays (sULAs) with different orientations. Compared with traditional architectures like hybrid analog/digital beamforming with uniform linear array (ULA) and uniform circular array (UCA), RAA has several promising advantages such as significantly reduced hardware cost, higher beamforming gains and the ability of providing uniform angular resolution for all directions. In this paper, we propose a full-angle RAA architecture and an innovative omnicell wireless communication paradigm enabled by full-angle RAA. The proposed full-angle RAA expands RAA's orientation angle to the full angle domain, such that the RAA's advantages can be exploited to all directions. This further enables the new concept of omnicell wireless communication system, with the base station equipped by full-angle RAA and deployed at the center of each cell. Compared to the conventional cell sectoring wireless communication system, the proposed omnicell system is expected to not only significantly reduce the inter-user interference, but also improve the cost efficiency. Extensive analytical and numerical results are provided to compare those key performance indicators such as the spatial resolution and the communication rate of the proposed full-angle RAA based omnicell wireless communication system against the conventional ULA/UCA-based cell sectoring systems.</description>

      <title>Affine Filter Bank Modulation (AFBM): A Novel 6G ISAC Waveform with Low PAPR and OOBE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the affine filter bank modulation (AFBM) waveform for enhanced integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in sixth generation (6G), designed by drawing on concepts from classical filter bank multicarrier modulation (FBMC) theory and recent advances in chirp-domain waveforms, particularly affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Specifically, AFBM exhibits several desirable properties, with emphasis on its remarkably low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and reduced out-of-band emission (OOBE) when benchmarked against the conventional AFDM waveform under doubly-dispersive (DD) channel conditions. In the communications setting, reliable symbol detection is achieved using a tailored low-complexity Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP)-based algorithm, while in the sensing setting, a range and velocity estimation approach is developed that integrates an expectation maximization (EM)-assisted probabilistic data association (PDA) framework to accurately identify surrounding targets. The highlighted performance and benefits of AFBM are validated through analytical and numerical evaluations, including conventional metrics such as ambiguity function (AF), bit error rate (BER), and root mean square error (RMSE), consolidating its position as a promising waveform for next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation and Beamforming in FIM-Assisted BS and STAR-BD-RIS-Aided NOMA: A Meta-Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores a flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM)-based wireless communication system that integrates simultaneously transmitting and reflecting beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-BD-RIS) with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The system features a multi-antenna FIM-assisted base station (BS) aided by dual-sector BD-RIS. The FIM consists of cost-effective radiating elements that can independently emit signals and dynamically adjust their vertical positions ("morphing"). The goal is to maximize energy efficiency by jointly optimizing BS beamforming, the STAR-BD-RIS matrix, NOMA constraints, and the FIM surface shape under power limits. Due to the problem's non-convexity, a meta-soft actor-critic (Meta-SAC) algorithm is proposed for adaptive optimization. Simulation results show that Meta-SAC outperforms the Meta-DDPG algorithm, and FIM-assisted designs yield substantial energy efficiency gains over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Anchor Deployment and Topology Design for Large-Scale AUV Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seafloor acoustic anchors are an important component of AUV navigation, providing absolute updates that correct inertial dead-reckoning. Unlike terrestrial positioning systems, the deployment of underwater anchor nodes is usually sparse due to the uneven distribution of underwater users, as well as the high economic cost and difficult maintenance of underwater equipment. These anchor nodes lack satellite coverage and cannot form ubiquitous backhaul as terrestrial nodes do. In this paper, we investigate the optimal anchor deployment topology to provide high-quality AUV navigation and positioning services. We first analyze the possible deployment mode in large-scale underwater navigation system, and formulate a topology optimization for underwater anchor node deployment. Then, we derive a scaling law about the influence of anchors in each cluster on the navigation performance within a given area and demonstrate a service area coverage condition with a high probability of reaching the destination. Finally, the optimization performance is evaluated through experimental results.</description>

      <title>Active noise cancellation in ultra-low field MRI: distinct strategies for different channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low field magnetic resonance imaging(ULF-MRI) systems operating in open environments are highly susceptible to composite electromagnetic interference(EMI). Different imaging channels respond non-uniformly to EMI owing to their distinct coupling characteristics. Here, we investigate channel-specific interference pathways in a permanent-magnet-based low-field MRI system and show that saddle coils are intrinsically more vulnerable to transverse EMI components than solenoidal coils. To mitigate these heterogeneous coupling effects, we propose a dual-stage suppression strategy that combines front-end spatial-domain inverse field reconstruction with back-end channel-adaptive active noise cancellation. Experiments demonstrate that this approach suppresses EMI by more than 80%, substantially improves inter-channel signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) consistency, and enhances the fused-image SNR by 24%. These findings elucidate the channel-dependent nature of EMI coupling and establish targeted mitigation strategies, providing both a theoretical basis and practical guidance for noise suppression in future array-coil ULF-MRI systems.</description>

      <title>DeepStream: Prototyping Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Real-Time Multimedia Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a promising technique in 6G for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of data transmission across diverse modalities, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. This advantage is realized by leveraging powerful neural networks to learn an optimal end-to-end mapping from the source data directly to the transmit symbol sequence, eliminating the need for separate source coding, channel coding, and modulation. Although numerous efforts have been made towards efficient DeepJSCC, they have largely stayed at numerical simulations that can be far from practice, leaving the real-world viability of DeepJSCC largely unverified. To this end, we prototype DeepStream upon orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to offer efficient and robust DeepJSCC for multimedia transmission. In conforming to OFDM, we develop both a feature-to-symbol mapping method and a cross-subcarrier precoding method to improve the subcarrier independence and reduce peak-to-average power ratio. To reduce system complexity and enable flexibility in accommodating varying quality of service requirements, we further propose a progressive coding strategy that adjusts the compression ratio based on latency with minimal performance loss. We implement DeepStream for real-time image transmission and video streaming using software-defined radio. Extensive evaluations verify that DeepStream outperforms both the standard scheme and the direct deployment scheme. Particularly, at an SNR of 10 dB, DeepStream achieves a PSNR of 35 dB for image transmission and an MS-SSIM of 20 dB for video streaming, whereas the standard scheme fails to recover meaningful information.</description>

      <title>3D-Image Reconstruction using MIMO-SAR FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of millimeter-wave radar technology, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging at millimeter-wave frequencies has gained significant attention in both academic research and industrial applications. However, traditional SAR imaging algorithms primarily focus on extracting two-dimensional information from detected targets, which limits their potential for 3D scene reconstruction. In this work, we demonstrated a fast time-domain reconstruction algorithm for achieving high-resolution 3D radar imaging at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies. This approach leverages a combination of virtual Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with the precision of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique, setting the stage for a new era of advanced radar imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Radar for ISAC: Sum-Rate Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for spectrum-efficient and hardware-converged wireless networks. However, classical radar systems within ISAC architectures face fundamental limitations under low signal power and high-noise conditions. This paper proposes a novel framework that embeds quantum illumination radar into a base station to simultaneously support full-duplex classical communication and quantum-enhanced target detection. The resulting integrated quantum sensing and classical communication (IQSCC) system is optimized via a sum-rate maximization formulation subject to radar sensing constraints. The non-convex joint optimization of transmit power and beamforming vectors is tackled using the successive convex approximation technique. Furthermore, we derive performance bounds for classical and quantum radar protocols under the statistical detection theory, highlighting the quantum advantage in low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio regimes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IQSCC system achieves a higher communication throughput than the conventional ISAC baseline while satisfying the sensing requirement.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antenna System (PASS) Enhanced Covert Communications: Against Warden via Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sensing-aided covert communication network empowered by pinching antenna systems (PASS) is proposed in this work. Unlike conventional fixed-position MIMO arrays, PASS dynamically reconfigures its pinching antennas (PAs) closer to the legitimate user, substantially enhancing covertness. To further secure the adversary's channel state information (CSI), a sensing function is leveraged to track the malicious warden's movements. In particular, this paper first proposes an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based approach to fulfilling the tracking function. Building on this, a covert communication problem is formulated with a joint design of beamforming, artificial noise (AN) signals, and the position of PAs. Then, the beamforming and AN design subproblems are resolved jointly with a subspace approach, while the PA position optimization subproblem is handled by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach by treating the evolution of the warden's mobility status as a temporally corrected process. Numerical results are presented and demonstrate that: i) the EKF approach can accurately track the warden's CSI with low complexity, ii) the effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by its outperformance over the greedy and searching-based benchmarks, and iii) with new design degrees of freedom (DoFs), the performance of PASS is superior to the conventional fully-digital MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Human Body Weight Estimation Through Music-Induced Bed Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate body weight estimation is critical in emergency medical care, as it directly influences treatment decisions, such as drug dosing, defibrillation energy selection, and fluid resuscitation. Traditional methods such as stand-on scales, length-based tapes, or transfer-based weighing scales are often impractical for immobilized patients, inaccurate, or labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper introduces MelodyBedScale, a non-intrusive and rapid on-bed weight estimation system that leverages bed vibration induced by music. The core insight is that body weight affects the vibration transfer function of the bed-body system, which is captured using vibration sensors placed on opposite sides of the bed. First, we identify weight-sensitive frequency bands and compose clinically acceptable soft, natural music with high signal energy in these frequency bands. This music is then played through a speaker mounted on the bed to induce bed vibrations. Additionally, to efficiently capture the complex weight-vibration relationship with limited data and enhance generalizability to unseen individuals and weights, we theoretically analyze the weight-vibration relationship and integrate the results into the activation functions of the neural network for physics-informed weight regression. We evaluated MelodyBedScale on both wooden and steel beds across 11 participants, achieving a mean absolute error of up to 1.55 kg.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distortion-Aware Multi-User Power Allocation for Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world wireless transmitter front-ends exhibit certain nonlinear behavior, e.g., signal clipping by a Power Amplifier (PA). Although many resource allocation solutions do not consider this for simplicity, it leads to inaccurate results or a reduced number of degrees of freedom, not achieving the global performance. In this work, we propose an optimal PA distortion-aware power allocation strategy in a downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) based massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) system. Assuming a soft-limiter PA model, where the transmission occurs under small-scale independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Rayleigh fading channel, we derive the wideband signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and formulate the power allocation problem. Most interestingly, the distortion introduced by the PA leads to an SNDR-efficient operating point without explicit transmit power constraints. While the optimization problem is non-convex, we decouple it into a non-convex total power allocation problem and a convex power distribution problem among the users (UEs). We propose an alternating optimization algorithm to find the optimum solution. Our simulation results show significant sum-rate gains over existing distortion-neglecting solutions, e.g., a median 4 times increase and a median 50\% increase for a 64-antenna and 512-antenna base station serving 60 users, respectively.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Aided LiDAR Point Cloud Transmission for Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception enables more accurate and comprehensive scene understanding by learning how to share information between agents, with LiDAR point clouds providing essential precise spatial data. Due to the substantial data volume generated by LiDAR sensors, efficient point cloud transmission is essential for low-latency multi-agent collaboration. In this work, we propose an efficient, robust and applicable LiDAR point cloud transmission system via the Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), termed LiDAR Point Cloud Feature Transmission (LPC-FT), to support collaborative perception among multiple agents. Specifically, we employ a density-preserving deep point cloud compression method that encodes the complete point cloud into a downsampled efficient representation. To mitigate the effects of the wireless channel, we design a channel encoder module based on self-attention to enhance LiDAR point cloud features and a feature fusion module based on cross-attention to integrate features from transceivers. Furthermore, we utilize the nonlinear activation layer and transfer learning to improve the training of deep neural networks in the presence the digital channel noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LPC-FT is more robust and effective than traditional octree-based compression followed by channel coding, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning-based compression techniques and existing semantic communication methods, reducing the Chamfer Distance by 30% and improving the PSNR by 1.9 dB on average. Owing to its superior reconstruction performance and robustness against channel variations, LPC-FT is expected to support collaborative perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Detection and Tracking Based on Radar Range-Doppler Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection and tracking are the basic tasks of radar systems. Current joint detection tracking methods, which focus on dynamically adjusting detection thresholds from tracking results, still present challenges in fully utilizing the potential of radar signals. These are mainly reflected in the limited capacity of the constant false-alarm rate model to accurately represent information, the insufficient depiction of complex scenes, and the limited information acquired by the tracker. We introduce the Integrated Detection and Tracking based on radar feature (InDT) method, which comprises a network architecture for radar signal detection and a tracker that leverages detection assistance. The InDT detector extracts feature information from each Range-Doppler (RD) matrix and then returns the target position through the feature enhancement module and the detection head. The InDT tracker adaptively updates the measurement noise covariance of the Kalman filter based on detection confidence. The similarity of target RD features is measured by cosine distance, which enhances the data association process by combining location and feature information. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method was validated through testing on both simulated data and publicly available datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards In-Air Ultrasonic QR Codes: Deep Learning for Classification of Passive Reflector Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable alternative for autonomous systems. While previous research has successfully classified individual acoustic landmarks, this paper takes a step towards increasing information capacity by introducing reflector constellations as encoded tags. Our primary contribution is a multi-label Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to simultaneously identify multiple, closely spaced reflectors from a single in-air 3D sonar measurement. Our initial findings on a small dataset confirm the feasibility of this approach, validating the ability to decode these complex acoustic patterns. Secondly, we investigated using adaptive beamforming with null-steering to isolate individual reflectors for single-label classification. Finally, we discuss the experimental results and limitations, offering key insights and future directions for developing acoustic landmark systems with significantly increased information entropy and their accurate and robust detection and classification.</description>

      <title>Near-Threshold Voltage Massive MIMO Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive MIMO systems have the potential to significantly enhance spectral efficiency, yet their widespread integration is hindered by the high power consumption of the underlying computations. This paper explores the applicability and effectiveness of Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) for massive MIMO signal processing to tackle the reliability challenge of Near Threshold Computing (NTC). We propose modifying matrix arithmetic Newton iteration MIMO algorithm to seamlessly integrate ABFT to detect any computational errors by inspecting the final result. The overhead from ABFT depends largely on the matrix dimensions, which in this context are dictated by the number of user equipments involved in the computation. NTC is a promising strategy for reducing the energy consumption in digital circuits by operating transistors at extremely reduced voltages. However, NTC is highly susceptible to variations in Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) which can lead to increased error rates in computations. Traditional techniques for enabling NTC, such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling guided by circuit level timing error detection methods, introduce considerable hardware complexity and are difficult to implement at high clock frequencies. In this context ABFT has emerged as a lightweight error detection method tailored for matrix operations without requiring any modifications on circuit-level and can be implemented purely in software.A MIMO accelerator was implemented on a reconfigurable hardware platform. Experimental results demonstrate that for sufficiently large problem sizes, the proposed method achieves a 36% power saving compared to baseline, with only an average of 3% computational overhead, at default clock frequency. These results indicate that combining ABFT with near-threshold operation provides a viable path toward energy-efficient and robust massive MIMO processors.</description>

      <title>SE and EE Tradeoff in Active STAR-RIS Assisted Systems With Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of resource efficiency maximization in an active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted communication system under practical transceiver hardware impairments (HWIs). We aim to obtain an optimal tradeoff between system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), by jointly optimizing the base station (BS) transmit beamforming and the active STAR-RIS beamforming. To tackle the challenges in the fractional objective function, we begin by applying the quadratic transformation method to simplify it into a manageable form. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is then developed to iteratively update the BS and STAR-RIS beamforming coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs better than other baseline schemes in the presence of HWIs. Moreover, the variation of the achievable SE-EE region with different transmit power budgets is analyzed.</description>

      <title>ISAC Imaging by Channel State Information using Ray Tracing for Next Generation 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is emerging as a cornerstone technology for sixth generation (6G) wireless systems, unifying connectivity and environmental mapping through shared hardware, spectrum, and waveforms. The following paper presents an ISAC imaging framework utilizing channel state information (CSI) per-path components, transmitter (TX) positions, and receiver (RX) positions obtained from the calibrated NYURay ray tracer at 6.75 GHz in the upper mid-band. Our work shows how each resolvable multipath component can be extracted from CSI estimation and cast into an equivalent three-dimensional reflection point by fusing its angle and delay information, which is useful and challenging for multi-bounce reflections. The primary contribution of the paper is the two-segment reflection point optimization algorithm, which independently estimates the path lengths from the TX position and RX position to an equivalent reflection point (ERP) on the object surface, thus enabling precise geometric reconstruction. Subsequently, we aggregate the ERPs derived from multiple pairs of TX and RX positions, generating dense three dimensional point clouds representing the objects in the channel. Experimental results validate that the proposed ISAC imaging framework accurately reconstructs object surfaces, edges, and curved features. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first demonstration of multi bounce ISAC imaging using wireless ray tracing at 6.75 GHz.</description>

      <title>RadHARSimulator V1: Model-Based FMCW Radar Human Activity Recognition Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a pivotal research area for applications requiring non-invasive monitoring. However, the acquisition of diverse and high-fidelity radar datasets for robust algorithm development remains a significant challenge. To overcome this bottleneck, a model-based frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar HAR simulator is developed. The simulator integrates an anthropometrically scaled $13$-scatterer kinematic model to simulate $12$ distinct activities. The FMCW radar echo model is employed, which incorporates dynamic radar cross-section (RCS), free-space or through-the-wall propagation, and a calibrated noise floor to ensure signal fidelity. The simulated raw data is then processed through a complete pipeline, including moving target indication (MTI), bulk Doppler compensation, and Savitzky-Golay denoising, culminating in the generation of high-resolution range-time map (RTM) and Doppler-time maps (DTMs) via both short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and Fourier synchrosqueezed transform (FSST). Finally, a novel neural network method is proposed to validate the effectiveness of the radar HAR. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the simulator successfully generates high-fidelity and distinct micro-Doppler signature, which provides a valuable tool for radar HAR algorithm design and validation. The installer of this simulator is released at: \href{https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/RadHARSimulatorV1-Model-Based-FMCW-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Simulator}{Github/JoeyBGOfficial/RadHARSimulatorV1}.</description>

      <title>Green Learning for STAR-RIS mmWave Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems. Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption. Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL) approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.</description>

      <title>Distributed Link Sparsification for Scalable Scheduling Using Graph Neural Networks (Journal Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wireless networks characterized by dense connectivity, the significant signaling overhead generated by distributed link scheduling algorithms can exacerbate issues like congestion, energy consumption, and radio footprint expansion. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a distributed link sparsification scheme employing graph neural networks (GNNs) to reduce scheduling overhead for delay-tolerant traffic while maintaining network capacity. A GNN module is trained to adjust contention thresholds for individual links based on traffic statistics and network topology, enabling links to withdraw from scheduling contention when they are unlikely to succeed. Our approach is facilitated by a novel offline constrained {unsupervised} learning algorithm capable of balancing two competing objectives: minimizing scheduling overhead while ensuring that total utility meets the required level. In simulated wireless multi-hop networks with up to 500 links, our link sparsification technique effectively alleviates network congestion and reduces radio footprints across four distinct distributed link scheduling protocols.</description>

      <title>Time-domain sound field estimation using kernel ridge regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound field estimation methods based on kernel ridge regression have proven effective, allowing for strict enforcement of physical properties, in addition to the inclusion of prior knowledge such as directionality of the sound field. These methods have been formulated for single-frequency sound fields, restricting the types of data and prior knowledge that can be used. In this paper, the kernel ridge regression approach is generalized to consider discrete-time sound fields. The proposed method provides time-domain sound field estimates that can be computed in closed form, are guaranteed to be physically realizable, and for which time-domain properties of the sound fields can be exploited to improve estimation performance. Exploiting prior information on the time-domain behaviour of room impulse responses, the estimation performance of the proposed method is shown to be improved using a time-domain data weighting, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed approach. It is further shown using both simulated and real data that the time-domain data weighting can be combined with a directional weighting, exploiting prior knowledge of both spatial and temporal properties of the room impulse responses. The theoretical framework of the proposed method enables solving a broader class of sound field estimation problems using kernel ridge regression where it would be required to consider the time-domain response rather than the frequency-domain response of each frequency separately.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal IRS Aided OFDM: Rate Maximization under Frequency-Dependent Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a broadband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system aided by a beyond diagonal intelligent reflecting surface (BD-IRS), where inter-connections exist among different elements such that the reflection matrix can exhibit a beyond diagonal structure. Under practical circuit structures, the reflection matrix of the BD-IRS is generally dependent on the circuit parameters (e.g., capacitance matrix for all tunable capacitors) as well as the operating frequency, which leads to couplings among the BD-IRS reflection matrices over different sub-carriers and consequently new challenges in the BD-IRS design. Motivated by this, we first model the relationship between the BD-IRS reflection matrices over different sub-carriers and the tunable capacitance matrix, and then formulate the joint optimization problem of the tunable capacitance matrix and power allocation over OFDM sub-carriers to maximize the achievable rate of the OFDM system. Despite the non-convexity of the problem, we propose an effective algorithm for finding a high-quality feasible solution via leveraging alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show the superiority of our proposed design over benchmark designs.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Resource Allocation in Interference-limited Multi-Channel Wireless Networks with QoS Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically. However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios. Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point. Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained resource allocation in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Automatic Generation Control subject to Ramp-Rate-Limits: Anytime Feasibility and Uniform Network-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers automatic generation control over an information-sharing network of communicating generators as a multi-agent system. The optimization solution is distributed among the agents based on information consensus algorithms, while addressing the generators' ramp-rate-limits (RRL). This is typically ignored in the existing linear/nonlinear optimization solutions but they exist in real-time power generation scenarios. Without addressing the RRL, the generators cannot follow the assigned rate of generating power by the optimization algorithm; therefore, the existing solutions may not necessarily converge to the exact optimal cost or may lose feasibility in practice. The proposed solution in this work addresses the ramp-rate-limit constraint along with the box constraint (limits on the generated powers) and the coupling-constraint (generation-demand balance) at all iteration times of the algorithm. The latter is referred to as the anytime feasibility and implies that at every termination point of the algorithm, the balance between the demand and generated power holds. To improve the convergence rate of the algorithm we further consider internal signum-based nonlinearity. We also show that our solution can tolerate communication link removal. This follows from the uniform-connectivity assumption on the communication network.</description>

      <title>Integrating Spatial and Semantic Embeddings for Stereo Sound Event Localization in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address the multimodal task of stereo sound event localization and detection with source distance estimation (3D SELD) in regular video content. 3D SELD is a complex task that combines temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the most challenging to model. Traditional SELD approaches typically rely on multichannel input, limiting their capacity to benefit from large-scale pre-training due to data constraints. To overcome this, we enhance a standard SELD architecture with semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion, which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. We perform an ablation study on the development set of the DCASE2025 Task3 Stereo SELD Dataset to assess the individual contributions of the language-aligned models and benchmark against the DCASE Task 3 baseline systems. Additionally, we detail the curation process of large synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets used for model pre-training. These datasets were further expanded through left-right channel swapping augmentation. Our approach, combining extensive pre-training, model ensembling, and visual post-processing, achieved second rank in the DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 3 (Track B), underscoring the effectiveness of our method. Future work will explore the modality-specific contributions and architectural refinements.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Bounds and Task-Centric Learning Complexity for Real-World Dynamic Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>BatStation: Toward In-Situ Radar Sensing on 5G Base Stations with Zero-Shot Template Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence between incumbent radar signals and commercial 5G signals necessitates a versatile and ubiquitous radar sensing for efficient and adaptive spectrum sharing. In this context, leveraging the densely deployed 5G base stations (BS) for radar sensing is particularly promising, offering both wide coverage and immediate feedback to 5G scheduling. However, the targeting radar signals are superimposed with concurrent 5G uplink transmissions received by the BS, and practical deployment also demands a lightweight, portable radar sensing model. This paper presents BatStation, a lightweight, in-situ radar sensing framework seamlessly integrated into 5G BSs. BatStation leverages uplink resource grids to extract radar signals through three key components: (i) radar signal separation to cancel concurrent 5G transmissions and reveal the radar signals, (ii) resource grid reshaping to align time-frequency resolution with radar pulse characteristics, and (iii) zero-shot template correlation based on a portable model trained purely on synthetic data that supports detection, classification, and localization of radar pulses without fine-tuning using experimental data. We implement BatStation on a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed and evaluate its performance with real 5G traffic in the CBRS band. Results show robust performance across diverse radar types, achieving detection probabilities of 97.02% (PUCCH) and 79.23% (PUSCH), classification accuracy up to 97.00%, and median localization errors of 2.68-6.20 MHz (frequency) and 24.6-32.4 microseconds (time). Notably, BatStation achieves this performance with a runtime latency of only 0.11/0.94 ms on GPU/CPU, meeting the real-time requirement of 5G networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.03346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning time-varying graphs from spatiotemporal measurements. Given an appropriate prior on the temporal behavior of signals, our proposed method can estimate time-varying graphs from a small number of available measurements. To achieve this, we introduce two regularization terms in convex optimization problems that constrain sparseness of temporal variations of the time-varying networks. Moreover, a computationally-scalable algorithm is introduced to efficiently solve the optimization problem. The experimental results with synthetic and real datasets (point cloud and temperature data) demonstrate our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Data-Adaptive Graph Framelets with Generalized Vanishing Moments for Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework for constructing tight framelet systems on graphs with localized supports based on partition trees. Our construction of framelets provides a simple and efficient way to obtain the orthogonality with $k$ arbitrary orthonormal vectors. When the $k$ vectors contain most of the energy of a family of graph signals, the orthogonality of the framelets intuitively possesses ``generalized ($k$-)vanishing'' moments, and thus, the coefficients are sparse. Moreover, our construction provides not only framelets that are overall sparse vectors but also fast and schematically concise transforms. In a data-adaptive setting, the graph framelet systems can be learned by conducting optimizations on Stiefel manifolds to provide the utmost sparsity for a given family of graph signals. Furthermore, we further exploit the generality of our proposed graph framelet systems for heterophilous graph learning, where graphs are characterized by connecting nodes mainly from different classes. The usual assumption that connected nodes are similar and belong to the same class for homophilious graphs is contradictory for heterophilous graphs. Thus, we are motivated to bypass simple assumptions on heterophilous graphs and focus on generating rich node features induced by the graph structure, so as to improve the graph learning ability of certain neural networks in node classification. We derive a specific system of graph framelets and propose a heuristic method to select framelets as features for neural network input. Several experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach for non-linear approximation, denoising, and node classification.</description>

      <title>"Iridescent" Reflective Tags to Enable Radar-based Orientation Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate orientation estimation of objects can aid in scene understanding in many applications. In this paper, we consider use cases where passive tags could be deployed to assist radar systems in estimating object orientation. Towards that end, we propose the concept of passive iridescent reflective tags that selectively reflect different wavelengths in different directions. We propose a conceptual tag design based on leaky-wave antennas. We develop a framework for signal modeling and orientation estimation with a multi-tone radar. We analyze the impact of imperfect tag location information, revealing that it minimally impacts orientation estimation accuracy. To reduce estimator complexity, we propose a radiation pointing angle-based estimator with near-optimal performance. We derive its feasible orientation estimation region and show that it depends mainly on the system bandwidth. Monte Carlo simulations validate our analytical results while evincing that the low-complexity estimator achieves near-optimal accuracy and that its feasible orientation estimation region closely matches that of the other estimators. Finally, we show that the optimal number of tones increases with the sensing time under a power budget constraint, multipath effects may be negligible, signal-to-noise ratio gains rise with the number of tones, and many radar antennas can hurt estimation performance when the signal contains very few tones.</description>

      <title>Line Spectral Analysis Using the G-Filter: An Atomic Norm Minimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area of spectral analysis has a traditional dichotomy between continuous spectra (spectral densities) which correspond to purely nondeterministic processes, and line spectra (Dirac impulses) which represent sinusoids. While the former case is important in the identification of discrete-time linear stochastic systems, the latter case is essential for the analysis and modeling of time series with notable applications in radar systems. In this paper, we develop a novel approach for line spectral estimation which combines ideas of Georgiou's filter banks (G-filters) and atomic norm minimization (ANM), a mainstream method for line spectral analysis in the last decade following the theory of compressed sensing. Such a combination is only possible because a Carath\'{e}odory--Fej\'{e}r-type decomposition is available for the covariance matrix of the filter output. The ANM problem can be characterized via semidefinite programming which can be solved efficiently. As a consequence, our optimization scheme can be seen as a substantial generalization of the standard ANM for line spectral estimation. Moreover, our ANM approach with a G-filter has significant advantages over subspace methods because it can work with just one output vector and without \emph{a priori} knowledge about the number of sinusoids in the input. Simulation results show that our approach performs favorably against the standard ANM, the frequency-selective ANM, and standard subspace methods MUSIC and ESPRIT under a variety of parameter configurations when the G-filter is suitably designed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of One-bit Quantized Box-Constrained Precoding in Large-Scale Multi-User Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of multi-antenna precoding strategies, considering hardware limitations such as low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which necessitate the quantization of transmitted signals. The typical approach starts with optimizing a precoder, followed by a quantization step to meet hardware requirements. This study analyzes the performance of a quantization scheme applied to the box-constrained regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder in the asymptotic regime, where the number of antennas and users grows proportionally. The box constraint, initially designed to cope with low-dynamic range amplifiers, is used here to control quantization noise rather than for amplifier compatibility. A significant challenge in analyzing the quantized precoder is that the input to the quantization operation does not follow a Gaussian distribution, making traditional methods such as Bussgang's decomposition unsuitable. To overcome this, the paper extends the Gordon's inequality and introduces a novel Gaussian Min-Max Theorem to model the distribution of the channel-distorted precoded signal. The analysis derives the tight lower bound for the signal-to-distortion-plus-noise ratio (SDNR) and the bit error rate (BER), showing that optimal tuning of the amplitude constraint improves performance.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Latent Fusion of ECG Leads for Early Assessment of Pulmonary Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in early assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) primarily focus on applying machine learning methods to centralized diagnostic modalities, such as 12-lead electrocardiogram (12L-ECG). Despite their potential, these approaches fall short in decentralized clinical settings, e.g., point-of-care and general practice, where handheld 6-lead ECG (6L-ECG) can offer an alternative but is limited by the scarcity of labeled data for developing reliable models. To address this, we propose a lead-specific electrocardiogram multimodal variational autoencoder (\textsc{LS-EMVAE}), which incorporates a hierarchical modality expert (HiME) fusion mechanism and a latent representation alignment loss. HiME combines mixture-of-experts and product-of-experts to enable flexible, adaptive latent fusion, while the alignment loss improves coherence among lead-specific and shared representations. To alleviate data scarcity and enhance representation learning, we adopt a transfer learning strategy: the model is first pre-trained on a large unlabeled 12L-ECG dataset and then fine-tuned on smaller task-specific labeled 6L-ECG datasets. We validate \textsc{LS-EMVAE} across two retrospective cohorts in a 6L-ECG setting: 892 subjects from the ASPIRE registry for (1) PH detection and (2) phenotyping pre-/post-capillary PH, and 16,416 subjects from UK Biobank for (3) predicting elevated pulmonary atrial wedge pressure, where it consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalizability and interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/Shef-AIRE/LS-EMVAE.</description>

      <title>Joint Design of Radar Receive Filter and Unimodular ISAC Waveform with Sidelobe Level Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been considered a key feature of next-generation wireless networks. This paper investigates the joint design of the radar receive filter and dual-functional transmit waveform for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC system. While optimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the radar receive spatial response and maximizing the achievable rate at the communication receiver, besides the constraints of full-power radar receiving filter and unimodular transmit sequence, we control the maximum range sidelobe level, which is often overlooked in existing ISAC waveform design literature, for better radar imaging performance. To solve the formulated optimization problem with convex and nonconvex constraints, we propose an inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) algorithm. For each subproblem in the proposed inexact ALM algorithm, we custom-design a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) scheme with closed-form solutions for all blocks of variable to enhance the computational efficiency. Convergence analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to provide a stationary and feasible solution. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate the impact of different system parameters on communication and radar imaging performance. Comparison with the existing works shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Iterative Decoder of Channel-polarized Multilevel Coding for Data Center Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data center networks (DCNs) require a low-cost, low-power optical transceiver to handle increased traffic from generative artificial intelligence, video streaming services, and more. Improving the required signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR) by digital signal processing such as forward error correction (FEC) mitigates the requirements for electrical and optical components. The optical transceivers in DCNs exploit a low-complexity soft-decision (SD) FEC, consisting of short block-length linear error-correcting codes and a low-complexity SD decoder (SDD), such as Chase decoding and ordered statistics decoding. The low-complexity SDD efficiently approaches a maximum likelihood decoding (MLD). However, the decoding performance of MLD is limited by its finite block length. In this paper, we describe the details of our proposed channel-polarized multilevel coding with iterative decoding (CP-MLC-ID). The proposed CP-MLC-ID improves the decoding performance by extending the codeword length to weakly and indirectly connect codewords via bypassed bits. The 19.5%-OH CP-MLC-ID using 128-bit extended Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (eBCH) and KP4 codes outperforms the concatenated eBCH and KP4 codes with a net coding gain of 0.25 and 0.40 dB for the same and double the number of SDDs, respectively. We also investigate the dependency of the decoding performance on the size of a bit interleaver. The performance degradation of CP-MLC-ID using an 8-bit interleaver is about 0.1 dB compared to using the large-bit interleaver. Our results indicate that even a weak connection by exclusive-OR between codewords improves the decoding performance, compared to simple concatenated codes in the DCNs.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation with XL MIMO Systems: OTA Classification via Trainable Analog Combining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator, similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the channel coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer and the receiver's analog combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the XL MIMO system to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, even in varying fading conditions, suggesting the paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as OTA artificial neural networks alongside their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for inference tasks with ultra low power wireless devices.</description>

Abstract: Accurate mobile device localization is critical for emerging 5G/6G applications such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. In this paper, we propose a unified localization method that integrates model-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods to reap their respective advantages by exploiting available map information. In order to avoid supervised learning, we generate training labels automatically via optimal transport (OT) by fusing geometric estimates with building layouts. Ray-tracing based simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves positioning accuracy for both line-of-sight (LoS) users (compared to ML-based methods) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) users (compared to model-based methods). Remarkably, the unified method is able to achieve competitive overall performance with the fully-supervised fingerprinting, while eliminating the need for cumbersome labeled data measurement and collection.</description>

      <title>Multi-output Classification using a Cross-talk Architecture for Compound Fault Diagnosis of Motors in Partially Labeled Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled target datasets. Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously. Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based designs-for compound fault diagnosis under partially labeled conditions. Based on this investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk architecture, residual neural dimension reductor (RNDR), that enables selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition, frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented using a motor-based test setup and evaluated across six domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the structural advantage of RNDR is more pronounced in compound fault settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods. Lastly, we analyzed the RNDR with various conditions, other models with increased number of parameters, and compared with the ablated RNDR structure.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Detector for Faulty GNSS Measurements Detection With Non-Gaussian Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault detection is crucial to ensure the reliability of navigation systems. However, mainstream fault detection methods are developed based on Gaussian assumptions on nominal errors, while current attempts at non-Gaussian fault detection are either heuristic or lack rigorous statistical properties. The performance and reliability of these methods are challenged in real-world applications. This paper proposes the jackknife detector, a fault detection method tailored for linearized pseudorange-based positioning systems under non-Gaussian nominal errors. Specifically, by leveraging the jackknife technique, a test statistic is derived as a linear combination of measurement errors, eliminating the need for restrictive distributional assumptions while maintaining computational efficiency. A hypothesis test with the Bonferroni correction is then constructed to detect potential faults in measurements. Theoretical analysis proves the equivalence between the jackknife detector and the solution separation (SS) detector, while revealing the former's superior computational efficiency. Through a worldwide simulation and a real-world satellite clock anomaly detection experiment--both involving non-Gaussian nominal errors--the proposed jackknife detector demonstrates equivalent detection performance to the SS detector but achieves a fourfold improvement in computational efficiency. These results highlight the jackknife detector's substantial potential for real-time applications requiring robust and efficient fault detection in non-Gaussian noise environments.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Channel-Aided CSI Prediction: An Environment-Based Subspace Extraction Approach for Achieving Low Overhead and High Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the robust and high-speed communication requirements of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication system in complex scenarios, sensing- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based digital twin channel (DTC) techniques become a promising approach to reduce system overhead. In this paper, we propose an environment-specific channel subspace basis (ECB)-aided partial-to-whole channel state information (CSI) prediction method (ECB-P2WCP) for realizing DTC-enabled low-overhead channel prediction. Specifically, we introduce a wireless environment knowledge (WEK) construction method that extracts ECB from the digital twin environment via subspace estimation. This ECB characterizes the static statistical properties of the electromagnetic environment and serves as environment information prior to the prediction task. Then, we fuse ECB with real-time estimated local CSI to predict the entire spatial-frequency domain channel for both the present and future time instances. Hence, an ECB-based partial-to-whole CSI prediction network (ECB-P2WNet) is designed to achieve a robust channel prediction scheme in various complex scenarios. Simulation results indicate that incorporating ECB provides significant benefits under low signal-to-noise ratio and pilot ratio conditions, achieving a reduction of up to 50\% in pilot overhead. Additionally, the proposed method maintains robustness against multi-user interference, tolerating 3-meter localization errors with only a 0.5 dB normalized mean square error increase, and predicts CSI for the next channel coherent time within 1.3 milliseconds.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming Design for Pinching Antenna-assisted Symbiotic Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel downlink symbiotic radio framework enabled by the pinching antenna system (PASS), designed to enhance both primary and secondary transmissions through reconfigurable antenna positioning. This reconfigurability introduces additional degrees of freedom for adaptive pinching beamforming, thereby enabling constructive signal enhancement and interference suppression tailored to the locations of the backscatter device, the Internet of Things (IoT) receiver, and the primary receivers. To fully exploit these benefits, we formulate a joint transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem that maximizes the achievable sum rate while satisfying the IoT receiver's detection error probability constraint and feasible deployment constraints for the pinching antennas. The resulting problem is inherently nonconvex and highly coupled. To address this challenge, we develop two complementary solution approaches. The first is a learning-aided gradient descent method, where the constrained optimization is reformulated into a differentiable form and solved through end-to-end learning. In this approach, the pinching antenna position matrix is reparameterized to automatically satisfy minimum spacing constraints, while transmit power and waveguide length limits are enforced via projection and normalization. The second approach is an optimization-based successive convex approximation-particle swarm optimization method, which first determines the transmit beamforming solution using successive convex approximation and subsequently optimizes pinching beamforming via a particle swarm optimization search over candidate pinching antenna placements.</description>

      <title>YOLO-based Bearing Fault Diagnosis With Continuous Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes a YOLO-based framework for spatial bearing fault diagnosis using time-frequency spectrograms derived from continuous wavelet transform (CWT). One-dimensional vibration signals are first transformed into time-frequency spectrograms using Morlet wavelets to capture transient fault signatures. These spectrograms are then processed by YOLOv9, v10, and v11 models to classify fault types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets, including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU), and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), the proposed CWT-YOLO pipeline achieves significantly higher accuracy and generalizability than the baseline MCNN-LSTM model. Notably, YOLOv11 reaches mAP scores of 99.4% (CWRU), 97.8% (PU), and 99.5% (IMS). In addition, its region-aware detection mechanism enables direct visualization of fault locations in spectrograms, offering a practical solution for condition monitoring in rotating machinery.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Rate Bounds and Constellation Shaping under Mixed Gaussian-Impulsive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed noise, composed of white Gaussian noise (WGN) and impulsive noise (IN), appears in numerous communication scenarios and can severely degrade system performance. In this paper, we optimize the transmitted constellation under mixed noise based on a theoretical analysis of the cutoff rate (CR). First, starting from the passband model of the mixed noise, we derive its corresponding baseband representation. Then, the baseband model is employed to obtain closed-form lower and upper bounds of the CR. A piecewise linear approximation is applied to derive efficient bounds by exploiting the algebraic properties of the integral terms. These bounds are then used as criteria to optimize the transmitted constellation points in both geometric positions and probabilistic distributions. The projected gradient method is employed to solve the optimization problem, and the convergence and properties of the solutions are analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CR bounds are tight and exhibit the expected asymptotic behavior. Furthermore, the optimized constellation scheme achieves a significant rate improvement compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Group Testing and Pooled Data in the Linear Regime with Sublinear Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items in the pool belonging to each category. A prominent special case is quantitative group testing (QGT), which is the case of pooled data with two categories. We consider these problems in the non-adaptive and linear regime, where the fraction of items in each category is of constant order. We propose a scheme with a spatially coupled Bernoulli test matrix and an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for recovery. We rigorously characterize its asymptotic performance in both the noiseless and noisy settings, and prove that in the noiseless case, the AMP algorithm achieves almost-exact recovery with a number of tests sublinear in the total number of items $p$. Although there exist other efficient schemes for noiseless QGT and pooled data that achieve recovery with order-optimal sample complexity ($\Theta(\frac{p}{\log p})$ tests), there are no guarantees on their performance in the presence of noise, even at low noise-levels. In comparison, our scheme achieves recovery in the noiseless case with a number of tests sublinear in $p$, and its performance degrades gracefully in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the spatially coupled scheme at finite dimensions, showing that it outperforms i.i.d. test designs as well as other recovery algorithms based on convex programming.</description>

      <title>Confirmation Bias in Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret information in a way that aligns with one's preconceptions, can profoundly impact scientific research, leading to conclusions that reflect the researcher's hypotheses even when the observational data do not support them. This issue is especially critical in scientific fields involving highly noisy observations, such as cryo-electron microscopy.
  This study investigates confirmation bias in Gaussian mixture models. We consider the following experiment: A team of scientists assumes they are analyzing data drawn from a Gaussian mixture model with known signals (hypotheses) as centroids. However, in reality, the observations consist entirely of noise without any informative structure. The researchers use a single iteration of the K-means or expectation-maximization algorithms, two popular algorithms to estimate the centroids. Despite the observations being pure noise, we show that these algorithms yield biased estimates that resemble the initial hypotheses, contradicting the unbiased expectation that averaging these noise observations would converge to zero. Namely, the algorithms generate estimates that mirror the postulated model, although the hypotheses (the presumed centroids of the Gaussian mixture) are not evident in the observations. Specifically, among other results, we prove a positive correlation between the estimates produced by the algorithms and the corresponding hypotheses. We also derive explicit closed-form expressions of the estimates for a finite and infinite number of hypotheses. This study underscores the risks of confirmation bias in low signal-to-noise environments, provides insights into potential pitfalls in scientific methodologies, and highlights the importance of prudent data interpretation.</description>

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a promising solution for non-contact driver monitoring by detecting subtle blood flow-induced facial color changes from video. However, motion artifacts in dynamic driving environments remain key challenges. This study presents an rPPG framework that combines signal processing techniques before and after applying Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) for pulse rate (PR) estimation in driving simulators. While not novel, the approach offers insights into the efficiency of the EVM method and its time complexity. We compare results of the proposed rPPG approach against reference Empatica E4 data and also compare it with existing achievements from the literature. Additionally, the possible bias of the Empatica E4 is further assessed using an independent dataset with both the Empatica E4 and the Faros 360 measurements. EVM slightly improves PR estimation, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm (the lowest MAE (~2 bpm) was achieved under strict conditions) with an additional time required for EVM of about 20 s for 30 s sequence. Furthermore, statistically significant differences are identified between younger and older drivers in both reference and rPPG data. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using rPPG-based PR monitoring, encouraging further research in driving simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a networked sensing system with multiple base stations (BSs), which collaboratively sense the unknown and random three-dimensional (3D) location of a target based on the target-reflected echo signals received at the BSs. Considering a practical scenario where the target location distribution is known a priori for exploitation, we aim to design the placement of the multiple BSs to optimize the networked sensing performance. Firstly, we characterize the posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) in sensing the target's 3D location. Despite its complex form under networked sensing, we derive its closed-form expression in terms of the BS locations. Next, we formulate the BS placement optimization problem to minimize the sensing PCRB, which is non-convex and difficult to solve. By leveraging a series of equivalent transformations and the iterative inner approximation method, we devise an algorithm with polynomial-time complexity which is guaranteed to converge to a solution satisfying the Karush-Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions of the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed placement design significantly outperforms various benchmark designs.</description>

Abstract: The explosive growth of teletraffic, fueled by the convergence of cyber-physical systems and data-intensive applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous systems, and immersive communications, demands a multidisciplinary suite of innovative solutions across the physical and network layers. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) represent a transformative advancement in antenna design, offering enhanced spatial degrees of freedom through dynamic reconfigurability. By exploiting spatial flexibility, FAS can adapt to varying channel conditions and optimize wireless performance, making it a highly promising candidate for next-generation communication networks. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in FAS research. We begin by examining key application scenarios in which FAS offers significant advantages. We then present the fundamental principles of FAS, covering channel measurement and modeling, single-user configurations, and the multi-user fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) framework. Following this, we delve into key network-layer techniques such as quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning, power allocation, and content placement strategies. We conclude by identifying prevailing challenges and outlining future research directions to support the continued development of FAS in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: In this work, a novel soft continuum robot-inspired antenna array is proposed, featuring tentacle-like structures with multiple antenna elements. The proposed array achieves reconfigurability through continuous deformation of its geometry, in contrast to reconfigurable antennas which incur a per-element control. More specifically, the deformation is modeled by amplitude and spatial frequency parameters. We consider a multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink system, whereby the optimal deformation parameters are found to maximize the sum rate in the network. A successive convex approximation method is adopted to solve the problem. Numerical results show that the proposed deformable array significantly outperforms fixed geometry and per-element reconfigurable arrays in sum rate, demonstrating the benefits of structure-level flexibility for next-generation antenna arrays.</description>

Abstract: This brief, aimed at practitioners, offers an analysis of the effect of sampling-time jitter, i. e., the error produced by execution-time inaccuracies. We propose reinterpreting jitter-afflicted linear time-invariant systems through equivalent jitter-free analogs. By constructing a perceived system that absorbs the effects of timing perturbations into its dynamics, we find an affine scaling of jitter. We examine both measurement and implementation scenarios, demonstrating that the presence of jitter effectively scales the system matrices. Moreover, we observe that, in the Laplace domain, jitter can be interpreted as a frequency scaling.</description>

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables. In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.</description>
