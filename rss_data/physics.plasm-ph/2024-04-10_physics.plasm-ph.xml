      <title>Deterministic and Stochastic Geometric Mechanics for Hall MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new models of stochastic Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by using a symmetry-reduced stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e variational principle. The new stochastic Hall MHD theory has potential applications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in space plasma (space weather) and solar physics. The stochastic geometric mechanics approach we take here produces coordinate-free results which may then be applied in a variety of spatial configurations.</description>

      <title>The Kadomtsev pinch revisited for sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kadomtsev pinch, namely the Z-pinch profile marginally stable to interchange modes, is revisited in light of observations from axisymmetric MHD modeling of the FuZE sheared-flow-stabilized Z-pinch experiment. We show that Kadomtsev's stability criterion, cleanly derived by the minimum energy principle but of opaque physical significance, has an intuitive interpretation in the specific entropy analogous to the Schwarzschild-Ledoux criterion for convective stability of adiabatic pressure distributions in the fields of astrophysics, meteorology, and oceanography. By analogy, the Kadomtsev profile may be described as magnetoadiabatic in the sense that plasma pressure is polytropically related to area-averaged current density from the ideal MHD stability condition on the specific entropy. Further, the non-ideal stability condition of the entropy modes is shown to relate the specific entropy gradient to the ideal interchange stability function. Hence, the combined activity of the ideal interchange and non-ideal entropy modes drives both the specific entropy and specific magnetic flux gradients to zero in the marginally stable state. The physical properties of Kadomtsev's pinch are reviewed in detail and following from this the localization of pinch confinement, i.e., pinch size and inductance, is quantified by the ratio of extensive magnetic and thermal energies. In addition, results and analysis of axisymmetric MHD modeling of the FuZE Z-pinch experiment are presented where pinch structure is found to consist of a near-marginal flowing core surrounded by a super-magnetoadiabatic low-beta sheared flow.</description>

      <title>Fluid Simulation for a Finite Size Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies on finite-size plasma have attracted a lot of attention lately. They can form by ionizing liquid droplets by lasers. The dynamical behavior of such plasma droplets is, therefore, a topic of significant interest. In particular, questions related to the linear and nonlinear characteristics (associated with the inhomogeneous density typically at the edge of the droplet), the behavior of plasma expansion, etc., are of interest. A one-dimensional fluid simulation study has been carried out to investigate this behavior. It is observed that a slight imbalance in the charge density leads to oscillations that are concentrated and keep acquiring higher amplitude and sharper profile at the inhomogeneous edge region. Such oscillations lead to the expansion of the droplet. Though the fluid description breaks when the sharpness of these structures becomes comparable to the grid size, it provides a reasonable estimate of wave-breaking time. The presence of dissipative effects like diffusion is shown to arrest the sharpness of these structures. The dynamics of these structures in the presence of an externally applied oscillating electric field corresponding to a long wavelength radiation has also been studied.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted optical diagnostics on a cylindrical atmospheric pressure surface dielectric barrier discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study explores combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with standard optical diagnostics (such as time--integrated emission spectroscopy and imaging) to accurately predict operating conditions and assess the emission uniformity of a cylindrical surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD). It is demonstrated that ML can be complementary with these optical diagnostics and identify peculiarities associated with the discharge emission pattern at different high voltage waveforms (AC and pulsed) and amplitudes. By employing unsupervised (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) and supervised (Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks) algorithms, the applied voltage waveform and amplitude are categorised and predicted based on correlations/differences identified within large amounts of corresponding data. PCA allowed us to effectively classify the voltage waveforms and amplitudes applied to the SDBD through a transformation of the spectroscopic/imaging data into principal components (PCs) and their projection to a two-dimensional PC space. Furthermore, an accurate prediction of the voltage amplitude is achieved using the MLP which is trained with PCA--preprocessed data. A particularly interesting aspect of this concept involves examining the uniformity of the emission pattern of the discharge. This is achieved by analysing spectroscopic data recorded at four different regions around the SDBD surface using the two ML--based techniques. These discoveries are instrumental in enhancing plasma--induced processes. They open up new avenues for real--time control, monitoring, and optimization of plasma--based applications across diverse fields such as flow control for the present SDBD.</description>

      <title>Electron acceleration and X-ray generation from near-critical-density carbon nanotube foams driven by moderately relativistic lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct laser acceleration of electrons in near-critical-density (NCD) carbon nanotube foams (CNFs) has its advantages in the high-efficiency generation of relativistic electrons and broadband X-rays. Here, we report the first simultaneous measurement on the spectra of laser-driven electrons and X-rays from CNFs at moderately relativistic intensities of around 5\times{10}^{19}\ W/cm^2.\ The density and thickness of the CNFs were scanned in the experiments, indicating the optimized electrons temperature of 5.5 MeV and X-ray critical energy of 5 keV. Two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations confirm that the electrons, with a temperature significantly higher than the pondermotive scale, are directly accelerated by the laser along the NCD plasma channel, while the bright X-rays are emitted by these electrons through betatron radiation or Thomson backscattering inside the channel. The simultaneously generated electrons and X-rays, automatically synchronized with the femtosecond laser driver, are suitable for applications such as bi-modal radiography.</description>

      <title>Achieving High Polarization of Photons Emitted by Unpolarized Electrons in Ultrastrong Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear Compton scattering driven by ultraintense lasers presents a promising avenue for enhancing the photon energy, brilliance, and setup compactness of $\gamma$-ray sources. However, a significant challenge lies in achieving a high polarization degree with commonly generated unpolarized electrons, thus addressing a longstanding puzzle in the field. Here we investigate the polarization dynamics of photons emitted by an unpolarized electron beam interacting with a counter-propagating ultraintense laser pulse numerically, and propose a novel method to generate highly polarized $\gamma$ rays via nonlinear Compton scattering with the aid of vacuum dichroism effect. Our simulations reveal that high-brilliance $\gamma$ rays with polarization beyond 90\% are feasible in a single-shot interaction, rivaling the highest achieved by any $\gamma$-ray sources to date, based on a developed Monte Carlo method incorporating polarization-resolved tree processes of nonlinear Compton scattering and Breit-Wheeler pair production and one-loop vacuum polarization. This generation method showcases an extraordinary ultra-high polarization degree and a user-friendly all-optical experimental setup, while harnessing the high photon energy and brilliance characteristic of nonlinear Compton scattering sources, thus making it of great potential for experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Micro-Bunching based on Transverse-Longitudinal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, three specific scenarios of a novel accelerator light source mechanism called steady-state micro-bunching (SSMB) have been studied, i.e., longitudinal weak focusing, longitudinal strong focusing and generalized longitudinal strong focusing (GLSF). Presently, GLSF is the most promising among them in realizing high-power short-wavelength coherent radiation with a mild requirement on the modulation laser power. Its essence is to exploit the ultrasmall natural vertical emittance in a planar electron storage ring for efficient microbunching formation, like a partial transverse-longitudinal emittance exchange at the optical laser wavelength range. By invoking such a scheme, the laser modulator of an SSMB storage ring can work in a continuous wave or high duty cycle mode, thus allowing a high filling factor of microbunched electron beam in the storage ring and high average output radiation power. The backbone of it is the precision transverse-longitudinal phase space coupling dynamics, which is analyzed in depth in this paper. Based on the investigation, an example parameters set of a GLSF SSMB storage ring which can deliver 1 kW-average-power EUV light is presented. The presented work here, like the analysis on theoretical minimum emittances, transverse-longitudinal coupling dynamics, derivation of bunching factor and modulation strengths, is expected to be useful not only for the development of SSMB, but also future accelerator light sources in general which demand more and more precise electron beam phase space manipulations.</description>

      <title>From MRI to SARI: Parametric survey of accretion disk instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion disks are highly unstable to magnetic instabilities driven by shear flow, where classically, the axisymmetric, weak-field Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) has received much attention through local WKB approximations. In contrast, discrete non-axisymmetric counterparts require a more involved analysis through a full global approach to deal with the influence of the nearby magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) continua. Recently, rigorous MHD spectroscopy identified a new type of an ultra-localised, non-axisymmetric instability in global disks with super-Alfv\'enic flow. These Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instabilities (SARIs) fill vast unstable regions in the complex eigenfrequency plane with (near-eigen)modes that corotate at the local Doppler velocity and are radially localised between Alfv\'enic resonances. Unlike discrete modes, they are utterly insensitive to the radial disk boundaries. In this work, we independently confirm the existence of these unprecedented modes using our novel spectral MHD code Legolas reproducing and extending our earlier study with detailed eigenspectra and eigenfunctions. We calculate growth rates of SARIs and MRI in a variety of disk equilibria, highlighting the impact of field strength and orientation, and find correspondence with analytical predictions for thin, weakly magnetised disks. We show that non-axisymmetric modes can significantly extend instability regimes at high mode numbers, with maximal growth rates comparable to the MRI. Furthermore, we explicitly show a region filled with quasi-modes whose eigenfunctions are extremely localised in all directions. These modes must be ubiquitous in accretion disks, and play a role in local shearing box simulations. Finally, we revisit recent dispersion relations in the Appendix, highlighting their relation to our global framework.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Contributions to the Turbulent Cascade in Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present evidence for nonlocal contributions to the turbulent energy cascade in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasmas. Therefore, we revisit a well-known result derived directly from the MHD equations, i.e., the Politano and Pouquet (P&amp;P) law for the transfer of kinetic and magnetic energy in scale. We propose adding a term that accounts for nonlocal transfer and represents the influence of fluctuations from large scales due to the Alfv\'en effect. Supported by direct numerical simulations of homogeneous and isotropic MHD turbulence, we verify that in some plasma configurations, neglecting the additional nonlocal term might consistently overestimate energy dissipation rates and, thus, the contributions of turbulent energy dissipation potentially affecting solar wind heating; a central puzzle in space plasma physics that motivates the present work.</description>

      <title>Enhancing predictive capabilities in fusion burning plasmas through surrogate-based optimization in core transport solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the PORTALS framework, which leverages surrogate modeling and optimization techniques to enable the prediction of core plasma profiles and performance with nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations at significantly reduced cost, with no loss of accuracy. The efficiency of PORTALS is benchmarked against standard methods, and its full potential is demonstrated on a unique, simultaneous 5-channel (electron temperature, ion temperature, electron density, impurity density and angular rotation) prediction of steady-state profiles in a DIII-D ITER Similar Shape plasma with GPU-accelerated, nonlinear CGYRO. This paper also provides general guidelines for accurate performance predictions in burning plasmas and the impact of transport modeling in fusion pilot plants studies.</description>
