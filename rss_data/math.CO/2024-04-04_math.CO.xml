      <title>The weak acyclic matching property in abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matching from a finite subset $A\subset\mathbb{Z}^n$ to another subset $B\subset\mathbb{Z}^n$ is a bijection $f : A \rightarrow B$ with the property that $a+f(a)$ never lies in $A$. A matching is called acyclic if it is uniquely determined by its multiplicity function. Alon et al. established the acyclic matching property for $\mathbb{Z}^n$, which was later extended to all abelian torsion-free groups. In a prior work, the authors of this paper settled the acyclic matching property for all abelian groups. The objective of this note is to explore a related concept, known as the weak acyclic matching property, within the context of abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Selected Open Problems in Continuous-Time Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks on graphs are fundamental to quantum computing and have led to many interesting open problems in algebraic graph theory. This review article highlights three key classes of open problems in this domain; perfect state transfer, instantaneous uniform mixing, and average mixing matrices. In highlighting these open problems, our aim is to stimulate further research and exploration in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Generalized saturation game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following game version of the generalized graph Tur\'an problem. For two fixed graphs F and H, two players, Max and Mini, alternately claim unclaimed edges of the complete graph Kn such that the graph G of the claimed edges must remain F-free throughout the game. The game ends when no further edges can be claimed, i.e. when G becomes F-saturated. The H-score of the game is the number of copies of H in G. Max aims to maximize the H-score, while Mini wants to minimize it. The H-score of the game when both players play optimally is denoted by s1(n, #H, F) when Max starts, and by s2(n, #H, F) when Mini starts. We study these values for several natural choices of F and H.</description>

      <title>The $2$-torsion of determinantal hypertrees is not Cohen-Lenstra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T_n$ be a $2$-dimensional determinantal hypertree on $n$ vertices. Kahle and Newman conjectured that the $p$-torsion of $H_1(T_n,\mathbb{Z})$ asymptotically follows the Cohen-Lenstra distribution. For $p=2$, we disprove this conjecture by showing that given a positive integer $h$, for all large enough $n$, we have \[\mathbb{P}(\dim H_1(T_n,\mathbb{F}_2)\ge h)\ge \frac{e^{-200h}}{(100h)^{5h}}.\] We also show that $T_n$ is a bad cosystolic expander with positive probability.</description>

      <title>A Classification of the flag-transitive $2$-$(v,k,2)$ designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a complete classification of $2$-$(v,k,2)$ design admitting a flag-transitive automorphism group of affine type with the only exception of the semilinear $1$-dimensional group. Alongside this analysis we provide a construction of seven new families of such flag-transitive $2$-designs, two of them infinite, and some of them involve remarkable objects such as $t$-spreads, translation planes, quadrics and Segre varieties.
  Our result together with those Alavi et al. [1,2], Praeger et al. [15], Zhou and the first author [37,38] provides a complete classification of $2$-$(v,k,2)$ design admitting a flag-transitive automorphism group with the only exception of the semilinear $1$-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>A note on the exact formulas for certain $2$-color partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p\leq 23$ be a prime and $a_p(n)$ count the number of partitions of $n$ using two colors where one of the colors only has parts divisible by $p$. Using a result of Sussman, we derive the exact formula for $a_p(n)$ and obtain an asymptotic formula for $\log a_p(n)$. Our results partially extend the work of Mauth, who proved the asymptotic formula for $\log a_2(n)$ conjectured by Banerjee et al.</description>

      <title>Grid-drawings of graphs in three-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using probabilistic methods, we obtain grid-drawings of graphs without crossings with low volume and small aspect ratio. We show that every $D$-degenerate graph on $n$ vertices can be drawn in $[m]^3$ where $m = O(D^{5/3} n^{1/3}\log^{4/3}n)$. In particular, every graph of bounded maximum degree can be drawn in a grid with volume $O(n \log^{4}n)$.</description>

      <title>Locally finite graphs and their localization numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Localization game on locally finite graphs trees, where each of the countably many vertices have finite degree. In contrast to the finite case, we construct a locally finite tree with localization number $n$ for any choice of positive integer $n$. Our examples have uncountably many ends, and we show that this is necessary by proving that locally finite trees with finitely or countably many ends have localization number at most 2. Finally, as is the case for finite graphs, we prove that any locally finite graph contains a subdivision where one cop can capture the robber.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the sequel of the paper under the same title with part 1, where we introduced refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials and their duals with two families of infinite parameters. In this paper we give combinatorial interpretations for these polynomials using generalizations of set-valued tableaux and reverse plane partitions, respectively. Our results extend to their flagged and skew versions.</description>

      <title>Degree Sequence Optimization and Extremal Degree Enumerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree sequence optimization problem is to find a subgraph of a given graph which maximizes the sum of given functions evaluated at the subgraph degrees. Here we study this problem by replacing degree sequences, via suitable nonlinear transformations, by suitable degree enumerators, and we introduce suitable degree enumerator polytopes.
  We characterize their vertices, that is, the extremal degree enumerators, for complete graphs and some complete bipartite graphs, and use these characterizations to obtain simpler and faster algorithms for optimization over degree sequences for such graphs.</description>

      <title>Nestings of BIBDs with block size four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a nesting of a balanced incomplete block design (or BIBD), we wish to add a point (the \emph{nested point}) to every block of a $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBD in such a way that we end up with a partial $(v,k+1,\lambda+1)$-BIBD. In the case where the partial $(v,k+1,\lambda+1)$-BIBD is in fact a $(v,k+1,\lambda+1)$-BIBD, we have a \emph{perfect nesting}. We show that a nesting is perfect if and only if $k = 2 \lambda + 1$.
  Perfect nestings were previously known to exist in the case of Steiner triple systems (i.e., $(v,3,1)$-BIBDs) when $v \equiv 1 \bmod 6$, as well as for some symmetric BIBDs. Here we study nestings of $(v,4,1)$-BIBDs, which are not perfect nestings. We prove that there is a nested $(v,4,1)$-BIBD if and only if $v \equiv 1 \text{ or } 4 \bmod 12$, $v \geq 13$. This is accomplished by a variety of direct and recursive constructions.</description>

      <title>Rays of the deformation cones of graphical zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute a triangulation of certain faces of the submodular cone. More precisely, graphical zonotopes are generalized permutahedra, and hence are associated to faces of the submodular cone. We give a triangulation of these faces for graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 4 vertices. This grants us access to the rays of these faces: Minkowski indecomposable deformations of these graphical zonotopes are segments and triangles. Besides, computer experiments lead to examples of graphs without induced complete sub-graph on 5 vertices, whose graphical zonotopes have high dimensional Minkowski indecomposable deformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive some combinatorial formulas related to the diagonal Ramsey numbers $R(k)$. Each formula is a statement of the form "$F(n,k) = 0$ if and only if $n \ge R(k)$," where $F(n,k)$ is a combinatorial expression which depends on $n$ and $k$. Our work is closely related to a recent work by De Loera and Wesley.</description>

      <title>A generalized Tur\'{a}n extension of the Deza--Erd\H{o}s--Frankl Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integer $r \ge 3$ and a subset $L \subset [0,r-1]$, a graph $G$ is $(K_{r}, L)$-intersecting if the number of vertices in the intersection of every pair of $K_r$ in $G$ belongs to $L$. We study the maximum number of $K_r$ in an $n$-vertex $(K_{r}, L)$-intersecting graphs. The celebrated Ruzsa--Szemer\'{e}di Theorem corresponds to the case $r=3$ and $L = \{0,1\}$.
  For general $L$ with $2 \le |L| \le r-1$, we establish the upper bound $\left(1-\frac{1}{3r}\right) \prod_{\ell \in L}\frac{n-\ell}{r- \ell}$ for large $n$, which improves the bound provided by the celebrated Deza--Erd\H{o}s--Frankl Theorem by a factor of $1-\frac{1}{3r}$. In the special case where $L = \{t, t+1, \ldots, r-1\}$, we derive the tight upper bound for large $n$ and establish a corresponding stability result. This is an extension of the seminal Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado Theorem on $t$-intersecting systems to the generalized Tur\'{a}n setting.
  Our proof for the Deza--Erd\H{o}s--Frankl part involves an interesting combination of the $\Delta$-system method and Tur\'{a}n's theorem. Meanwhile, for the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado part, we employ the stability method, which relies on a theorem of Frankl regarding $t$-intersecting systems.</description>

      <title>Mixed volumes of zonoids and the absolute value of the Grassmannian (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zonoids are Hausdorff limits of zonotopes, while zonotopes are convex polytopes defined as the Minkowski sums of finitely many segments. We present a combinatorial framework that links the study of mixed volumes of zonoids (a topic that has applications in algebraic combinatorics) with the study of the absolute value of the Grassmannian, defined as the image of the Grassmannian under the coordinate-wise absolute value map. We use polyhedral computations to derive new families of inequalities for n zonoids in dimension d, when (n,d)=(6,2) and (6,3). Unlike the classical geometric inequalities, originating from the Brunn-Minkowski and Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequalities, the inequalities we produce have the special feature of being Minkowski linear in each of the n zonoids they involve.</description>

      <title>Domination number of modular product graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modular product $G\diamond H$ of graphs $G$ and $H$ is a graph on vertex set $V(G)\times V(H)$. Two vertices $(g,h)$ and $(g^{\prime},h^{\prime})$ of $G\diamond H$ are adjacent if $g=g^{\prime}$ and $hh^{\prime}\in E(H)$, or $gg^{\prime}\in E(G)$ and $h=h^{\prime}$, or $gg^{\prime}\in E(G)$ and $hh^{\prime}\in E(H)$, or (for $g\neq g^{\prime}$ and $h\neq h^{\prime}$) $gg^{\prime}\notin E(G)$ and $hh^{\prime}\notin E(H)$. A set $D\subseteq V(G)$ is a dominating set of $G$ if every vertex outside of $D$ contains a neighbor in $D$. A set $D\subseteq V(G)$ is a total dominating set of $G$ if every vertex of $G$ contains a neighbor in $D$. The domination number $\gamma(G)$ (resp. total domination number $\gamma_{t}(G)$) of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a dominating set (resp. total dominating set) of $G$. In this work we give several upper and lower bounds for $\gamma(G\diamond H)$ in terms of $\gamma(G),$ $\gamma(H)$, $\gamma_{t}(\overline{G})$ and $\gamma _{t}(\overline{H})$, where $\overline{G}$ is the complement graph of $G$. Further, we fully describe graphs where $\gamma(G\diamond H)=k$ for $k\in\{1,2,3\}$. Several conditions on $G$ and $H$ under which $\gamma (G\diamond H)$ is at most $4$ and $5$ are also given. A new type of simultaneous domination $\bar{\gamma}(G)$, defined as the smallest number of vertices that dominates $G$ and totally dominates the complement of $G,$ emerged as useful and we believe it could be of independent interest. We conclude the paper by proposing few directions for possible further research.</description>

      <title>Marton's Conjecture in abelian groups with bounded torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Freiman--Ruzsa-type theorem with polynomial bounds in arbitrary abelian groups with bounded torsion, thereby proving (in full generality) a conjecture of Marton. Specifically, let $G$ be an abelian group of torsion $m$ (meaning $mg=0$ for all $g \in G$) and suppose that $A$ is a non-empty subset of $G$ with $|A+A| \leq K|A|$. Then $A$ can be covered by at most $(2K)^{O(m^3)}$ translates of a subgroup of $H \leq G$ of cardinality at most $|A|$. The argument is a variant of that used in the case $G = \mathbf{F}_2^n$ in a recent paper of the authors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study Dirac-type theorems for an inhomogenous random graph (G) whose edge probabilities are not necessarily all the same. We obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of Hamiltonian paths and perfect matchings, in terms of the \emph{sum} of edge probabilities. For edge probability assignments with two-sided bounds, we use P\'osa rotation and single vertex exclusion techniques to show that (G) is Hamiltonian with high probability. For weaker one-sided bounds, we use bootstrapping techniques to obtain a perfect matching in (G,) with high probability. We also highlight an application of our results in the context of channel assignment problem in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>The edge code of hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, we introduce a new class of evaluation toric codes called edge codes derived from $\mathcal{H}$. We analyze these codes, focusing on determining their basic parameters. We provide estimations for the minimum distance, particularly in scenarios involving $d$-uniform clutters. Additionally, we demonstrate that these codes exhibit self-orthogonality. Furthermore, we compute the minimum distances of edge codes for all graphs with five vertices.</description>

      <title>Concentration and central limit theorem for the averaging process on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the averaging process on a graph $G = (V, E)$, a random mass distribution $\eta$ on $V$ is repeatedly updated via transformations of the form $\eta_{v}, \eta_{w} \mapsto (\eta_{v} + \eta_{w})/2$, with updates made according to independent Poisson clocks associated to the edge set $E$. We study the averaging process when $G$ is the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. We prove that the process has tight asymptotic concentration around its mean in the $\ell^{1}$ and $\ell^{2}$ norms and use this to prove a central limit theorem. Previous work by Nagahata and Yoshida implies the central limit theorem when $d \geq 3$. Our results extend this to hold for all $d \geq 1$, and our techniques are likely applicable to other processes for which previously only the $d \geq 3$ case was tractable.</description>

Abstract: In 2008, Spivey found a recurrence relation for the Bell numbers. We consider the probabilistic r-Bell polynomials associated with which are a probabilistic extension of the r-Bell polynomials. Here Y is a random variable whose moment generating function exists in some neighborhood of the origin . The aim of this paper is to generalize the relation for the Bell numbers to that for the probabilistic r-Bell polynomials associated with Y.</description>

      <title>On Covering Simplices by Dilations in Dimensions 3 and 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a conjecture regarding the integrally closedness of lattice polytopes with large lattice lengths. We demonstrate that a lattice simplex in dimension 3 (resp. 4) with lattice length of at least 2 (resp. 3 and no edge has lattice length 5) can be covered by dilated simplices of the form $sQ$, where integer $s\ge 2$ (resp. 3) and $Q$ is a lattice simplex. The covering property implies these simplices are integrally closed. As an application, we derive a simple criterion for the projective normality of ample line bundles on weighted projective spaces of dimension 3 (resp. 4). Along the way, we discover certain unexpected phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dimer model is a quiver with faces embedded into a disk. A consistent dimer model gives rise to a strand diagram, and hence to a positroid. The Gorenstein-projective module category over the completed boundary algebra of a dimer model was shown by Pressland to categorify a cluster structure on the corresponding positroid variety. Outside of the Grassmannian case, boundary algebras of dimer models are not well understood. We give an explicit description of the boundary algebra of a consistent dimer model as a quiver with relations calculated only from the data of the decorated permutation or, equivalently, Grassmann necklace of its positroid.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials and their duals with two infinite sequences of parameters. These polynomials unify several generalizations of Grothendieck polynomials including canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials due to Yeliussizov, refined Grothendieck polynomials due to Chan and Pflueger, and refined dual Grothendieck polynomials due to Galashin, Liu, and Grinberg. We give Jacobi--Trudi-like formulas, combinatorial models, Schur expansions, Schur positivity, and dualities of these polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Kamiya, Takemura, and Terao introduced a characteristic quasi-polynomial which enumerates the numbers of elements in the complement of hyperplane arrangements modulo positive integers. In this paper, we compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials for arrangements which contain the Coxeter arrangements of types A, B, C, and D described by the orthonormal basis. We also compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials for their deletion arrangements and we can show that they are factorized. From this result, the poset generated by hypertori of the corresponding torus arrangement is an inductive poset (with respect to the characteristic polynomial).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05422v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph, we associate each edge with the transposition which exchanges the endvertices. Fixing a linear order on the edge set, we obtain a permutation of the vertices. D\'enes proved that the permutation is a full cyclic permutation for any linear order if and only if the graph is a tree.
  In this article, we characterize graphs having a linear order such that the associated permutation is a full cyclic permutation in terms of graph embeddings. Moreover, we give a counter example for Eden's question about an edge ordering whose associated permutation is the identity.</description>

      <title>Scattered trinomials of $\mathbb{F}_{q^6}[X]$ in even characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, several families of scattered polynomials have been investigated in the literature. However, most of them only exist in odd characteristic. In [B. Csajb\'ok, G. Marino and F. Zullo: New maximum scattered linear sets of the projective line, Finite Fields Appl. 54 (2018), 133-150; G. Marino, M. Montanucci and F. Zullo: MRD-codes arising from the trinomial $x^q+x^{q^3}+cx^{q^5}\in\mathbb{F}_{q^6}[x]$, Linear Algebra Appl. 591 (2020), 99-114], the authors proved that the trinomial $f_c(X)=X^{q}+X^{q^{3}}+cX^{q^{5}}$ of $\mathbb{F}_{q^6}[X]$ is scattered under the assumptions that $q$ is odd and $c^2+c=1$. They also explicitly observed that this is false when $q$ is even. In this paper, we provide a different set of conditions on $c$ for which this trinomial is scattered in the case of even $q$. Using tools of algebraic geometry in positive characteristic, we show that when $q$ is even and sufficiently large, there are roughly $q^3$ elements $c \in \mathbb{F}_{q^6}$ such that $f_{c}(X)$ is scattered. Also, we prove that the corresponding MRD-codes and $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear sets of $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^6)$ are not equivalent to the previously known ones.</description>

Abstract: OSCAR is an innovative new computer algebra system which combines and extends the power of its four cornerstone systems - GAP (group theory), Singular (algebra and algebraic geometry), Polymake (polyhedral geometry), and Antic (number theory). Assuming little familiarity with the subject, we give an introduction to computations in polyhedral geometry using OSCAR, as a chapter of the upcoming OSCAR book. In particular, we define polytopes, polyhedra, and polyhedral fans, and we give a brief overview about computing convex hulls and solving linear programs. Three detailed case studies are left for experts in polyhedral geometry. These are concerned with face numbers of random polytopes, constructions and properties of Gelfand-Tsetlin polytopes, and secondary polytopes.</description>

Abstract: We study arrangements of geodesic arcs on a sphere, where all arcs are internally disjoint and each arc has its endpoints located within the interior of other arcs. We establish fundamental results concerning the minimum number of arcs in such arrangements, depending on local geometric constraints such as "one-sidedness" and "k-orientation".
  En route to these results, we generalize and settle an open problem from CCCG 2022, proving that any such arrangement has at least two "clockwise swirls" and at least two "counterclockwise swirls".</description>

      <title>On the (non-)existence of tight distance-regular graphs: a local approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a distance-regular graph with diameter $D\geq 3$. Juri\v{s}i\'c and Vidali conjectured that if $\Gamma$ is tight with classical parameters $(D,b,\alpha,\beta)$, $b\geq 2$, then $\Gamma$ is not locally the block graph of an orthogonal array nor the block graph of a Steiner system. In the present paper, we prove this conjecture and, furthermore, extend it from the following aspect. Assume that for every triple of vertices $x, y, z$ of $\Gamma$, where $x$ and $y$ are adjacent, and $z$ is at distance $2$ from both $x$ and $y$, the number of common neighbors of $x$, $y$, $z$ is constant. We then show that if $\Gamma$ is locally the block graph of an orthogonal array (resp. a Steiner system) with smallest eigenvalue $-m$, $m\geq 3$, then the intersection number $c_2$ is not equal to $m^2$ (resp. $m(m+1)$). Using this result, we prove that if a tight distance-regular graph $\Gamma$ is not locally the block graph of an orthogonal array or a Steiner system, then the valency (and hence diameter) of $\Gamma$ is bounded by a function in the parameter $b=b_1/(1+\theta_1)$, where $b_1$ is the intersection number of $\Gamma$ and $\theta_1$ is the second largest eigenvalue of $\Gamma$.</description>

Abstract: The order and chain polytopes are two 0/1-polytopes constructed from a finite poset. In this paper, we study the $f$-vectors of these polytopes. We investigate how the order and chain polytopes behave under disjoint unions and ordinal sums of posets, and how the $f$-vectors of these polytopes are expressed in terms of $f$-vectors of smaller polytopes. Our focus is on comparing the $f$-vectors of the order and chain polytope built from the same poset. In our main theorem we prove that for a family of posets built inductively by taking disjoint unions and ordinal sums of posets, for any poset $\mathcal{P}$ in this family the $f$-vector of the order polytope of $\mathcal{P}$ is component-wise at most the $f$-vector of the chain polytope of $\mathcal{P}$.</description>

      <title>Incidence bounds via extremal graph theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of counting point-hyperplane incidences in the $d$-dimensional space was initiated in the 1990's by Chazelle and became one of the central problems in discrete geometry. It has interesting connections to many other topics, such as additive combinatorics and theoretical computer science. Assuming a standard non-degeneracy condition, i.e., that no $s$ points are contained in the intersection of $s$ hyperplanes, the currently best known upper bound on the number of incidences of $m$ points and $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is $$O_{d, s}((mn)^{1-1/(d+1)}+m+n).$$ This bound by Apfelbaum and Sharir is based on geometrical space partitioning techniques, which apply only over the real numbers.
  In this paper, we propose a novel combinatorial approach to study such incidence problems over arbitrary fields. Perhaps surprisingly, this approach matches the best known bounds for point-hyperplane incidences in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for many interesting values of $m, n, d$, e.g. when $m=n$ and $d$ is odd. Moreover, in finite fields our bounds are sharp as a function of $m$ and $n$ in every dimension. We also study the size of the largest complete bipartite graph in point-hyperplane incidence graphs with a given number of edges and obtain optimal bounds as well.
  Additionally, we study point-variety incidences and unit-distance problem in finite fields, and give tight bounds for both problems under a similar non-degeneracy assumption. We also resolve Zarankiewicz type problems for algebraic graphs. Our proofs use tools such as induced Tur\'an problems, VC-dimension theory, evasive sets and Hilbert polynomials. Also, we extend the celebrated result of R\'onyai, Babai and Ganapathy on the number of zero-patterns of polynomials to the context of varieties, which might be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Box Conjecture for pairs of commuting nilpotent matrices, as formulated by Iarrobino et al [28]. This describes the Jordan type of the dense orbit in the nilpotent commutator of a given nilpotent matrix. Our main tool is the Burge correspondence between the set of all partitions and a set of binary words [15, 16]. For connection with the algebraic and geometric setup of matrices and orbits we employ some of Shayman's results on invariant subspaces of a nilpotent matrix [45, 46]. Our proof is valid over an arbitrary field.</description>

Abstract: We study the graph parameter elimination distance to bounded degree, which was introduced by Bulian and Dawar in their study of the parameterized complexity of the graph isomorphism problem. We prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphs, that is, there exists an algorithm that given a planar graph $G$ and integers $d$ and $k$ decides in time $f(k,d)\cdot n^c$ for a computable function~$f$ and constant $c$ whether the elimination distance of $G$ to the class of degree $d$ graphs is at most $k$.</description>

      <title>Typical structure of sparse exponential random graph models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider general Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) where the sufficient statistics are functions of homomorphism counts for a fixed collection of simple graphs $F_k$. Whereas previous work has shown a degeneracy phenomenon in dense ERGMs, we show this can be cured by raising the sufficient statistics to a fractional power. We rigorously establish the na\"ive mean-field approximation for the partition function of the corresponding Gibbs measures, and in case of "ferromagnetic" models with vanishing edge density show that typical samples resemble a typical Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph with a planted clique and/or a planted complete bipartite graph of appropriate sizes. We establish such behavior also for the conditional structure of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph in the large deviations regime for excess $F_k$-homomorphism counts. These structural results are obtained by combining quantitative large deviation principles, established in previous works, with a novel stability form of a result of [5] on the asymptotic solution for the associated entropic variational problem. A technical ingredient of independent interest is a stability form of Finner's generalized H\"older inequality.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms for Vizing's theorem on bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05408v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be properly edge-colored using $\Delta + 1$ colors. The fastest currently known $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring algorithm for general graphs is due to Sinnamon and runs in time $O(m\sqrt{n})$, where $n :=|V(G)|$ and $m :=|E(G)|$. We investigate the case when $\Delta$ is constant, i.e., $\Delta = O(1)$. In this regime, the runtime of Sinnamon's algorithm is $O(n^{3/2})$, which can be improved to $O(n \log n)$, as shown by Gabow, Nishizeki, Kariv, Leven, and Terada. Here we give an algorithm whose running time is only $O(n)$, which is obviously best possible. Prior to this work, no linear-time $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring algorithm was known for any $\Delta \geq 4$. Using some of the same ideas, we also develop new algorithms for $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring in the $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model of distributed computation. Namely, when $\Delta$ is constant, we design a deterministic $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ algorithm with running time $\tilde{O}(\log^5 n)$ and a randomized $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ algorithm with running time $O(\log ^2 n)$. Although our focus is on the constant $\Delta$ regime, our results remain interesting for $\Delta$ up to $\log^{o(1)} n$, since the dependence of their running time on $\Delta$ is polynomial. The key new ingredient in our algorithms is a novel application of the entropy compression method.</description>

      <title>Convex bodies of constant width with exponential illumination number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there exist convex bodies of constant width in $\mathbb{E}^n$ with illumination number at least $(\cos(\pi/14)+o(1))^{-n}$, answering a question by G. Kalai. Furthermore, we prove the existence of finite sets of diameter $1$ in $\mathbb{E}^n$ which cannot be covered by $(2/\sqrt{3}+o(1))^{n}$ balls of diameter $1$, improving a result by J. Bourgain and J. Lindenstrauss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How many 2-cells must contain two finite pseudo-simplicial 2-complexes to admit a common, but not finite common, covering? We obtain an almost answer: the minimum possible number of 2-cells is 3, 4, or 5 (in each complex).</description>
