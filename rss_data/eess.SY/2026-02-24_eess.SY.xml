      <title>An Electricity Market with Reactive Power Trading: Incorporating Dynamic Operating Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity market design that accounts for grid constraints such as voltage and thermal limits at the distribution level can increase opportunities for the grid integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). In this paper, we consider rooftop solar backed by battery storage connected to a distribution grid. We design an electricity market to support customers sharing rooftop generation in excess of their energy demand, where customers earn a profit through peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. Our proposed electricity market also incorporates P2P reactive power trading to improve the voltage profile across a distribution feeder. We formulate the electricity market as an optimization-based problem, where voltage and thermal limits across a feeder are managed through the assignment of customer-specific dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). The electricity market equilibrium is referred to as a competitive equilibrium, which is equivalent to a Nash equilibrium in a standard game. Our proposed market design is benchmarked using the IEEE 13-node test feeder.</description>

      <title>Seeking Nash Equilibrium in Non-cooperative Quadratic Games Under Delayed Information Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the seeking of Nash equilibrium (NE) in a non-cooperative quadratic game where all agents exchange their delayed strategy information with their neighbors. To extend best-response algorithms to the delayed information setting, an estimation mechanism for each agent to estimate the current strategy profile is designed. Based on the best-response strategy to the estimations, the strategy profile dynamics of all agents is established, which is revealed to converge asymptotically to the NE when agents exchange multi-step-delay information via the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. In the scenario where agents exchange one-step-delay information, the exponential convergence of the strategy profile dynamics to the NE can be guaranteed by restricting the learning rate to less than an upper bound. Moreover, a lower bound on the learning rate for instability of the NE is proposed. Numerical simulations are provided for verifying the developed results.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Gradient Descent Approach to Design Policy Gradient Methods for LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) framework to design data-driven policy gradient descent algorithms for the linear quadratic regulator problem. Two alternative schemes are considered to estimate the policy gradient from stochastic trajectory data: (i) an indirect online identification based approach, in which the system matrices are first estimated and subsequently used to construct the gradient, and (ii) a direct zeroth-order approach, which approximates the gradient using empirical cost evaluations. In both cases, the resulting gradient estimates are random due to stochasticity in the data, allowing us to use SGD theory to analyze the convergence of the associated policy gradient methods. A key technical step consists of modeling the gradient estimates as suitable stochastic gradient oracles, which, because of the way they are computed, are inherently based. We derive sufficient conditions under which SGD with a biased gradient oracle converges asymptotically to the optimal policy, and leverage these conditions to design the parameters of the gradient estimation schemes. Moreover, we compare the advantages and limitations of the two data-driven gradient estimators. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Unified Diagnostics for Quantifying AC Operating-Point Robustness Under Injection and Topological Uncertainties with Regime Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of uncertainties in load, generation, and network topology, power system planning must reflect operational conditions, while operations require situational awareness over credible uncertainty sets. Existing methods screen, analyze, embed, and propagate uncertainty in power flow and optimal power flow settings, but provide only partial insight into how physical constraints, controls, and economic interactions shape steady-state operating-point robustness. By formulating operating-point robustness as a post-solution physical response problem around a solved AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) equilibrium, this paper presents a unified framework for assessing robustness under injection and topological uncertainty without re-optimization. We construct a primal physical response mapping that accounts for connectivity changes, active power redistribution, generator saturation including $PV \rightarrow PQ$ transitions, and AC network propagation, and introduce quasi-duals that provide a geometric interpretation of shadow prices for off-optimal equilibria. Using these mappings, we develop deterministic screening procedures that generalize $N-k$ contingency analysis to include cost vulnerability $C-k$, and local analogs $N+\delta(k)$ and $C+\delta(k)$ defined through sensitivity-normalized margins and risk tolerances. The framework is extended to probabilistic screening for distribution- and moment-based uncertainties, with sequentially-pruned mixture modeling and $\alpha$-stressed regime constructions to manage combinatorial branching. A case study on the Puerto Rican bulk power system demonstrates integration with geospatial data to enhance operational and planning awareness.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Transportation Without Prior Object Knowledge via Adaptive Self-Allocation and Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel cooperative transportation framework for multi-agent systems that does not require any prior knowledge of cargo locations or sizes. Each agent relies on local sensing to detect cargos, recruit nearby agents, and autonomously form a transportation team with an appropriate size. The core idea is that once an agent detects a cargo within its sensing range, it generates an attraction field represented by a density function, which pulls neighboring agents toward the cargo. When multiple cargos are present, the attraction fields generated by different agents are adaptively weighted and combined with Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), enabling agents to self-organize into balanced formations while automatically allocating more agents to larger cargos. To prevent agents from clustering on one side of a large cargo, a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based mechanism is introduced to enforce safe inter-agent distances and promote a uniform, symmetric distribution of agents around each cargo, which is essential for stable transportation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can simultaneously transport multiple cargos of different sizes in a coordinated and collision-free manner.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Spatially Distributed Cavity Laser and Boundary of Resonant Beam SLIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially distributed cavity (SDC) lasers are a promising technology for simultaneous light information and power transfer (SLIPT), offering benefits such as increased mobility and intrinsic safety, which are advantageous for various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \mll However, achieving beam transmission over meter-level long working distances presents significant challenges from cavity stability constraints, manufacturing/assembly tolerances, and diffraction losses\mrr. This paper conducts a theoretical investigation of the fundamental restrictions limiting long-range resonant beam generation. We investigate cavity stability and beam characteristics, and propose a binary-search-based Monte Carlo simulation algorithm as well as a linear approximation algorithm to quantify the maximum acceptable tolerances for stable operation. \mll Numerical results indicate that the stable region contracts sharply as distance increases. For fixed-component systems, an acceptable tolerance of 0.01 mm restricts the achievable transmission distance to less than 2 m. \mrr To address this limitation, we also prove the feasibility of long-range beam formation using precision adjustable elements, paving the way for advanced engineering applications. \mll Experimental results verified this assumption, demonstrating that by tuning the stable region during assembly, the transmission distance could be extended to 2.8 m. \mrr This work provides essential theoretical insights and practical design guidelines for realizing stable, long-range SDC systems.</description>

      <title>A Power Market Model with Hypersaclers and Modular Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of AI has led the growth of computational demand, with large language models (LLMs) at the forefront since ChatGPT's debut in 2022. Meanwhile, large amounts of renewable energy have been deployed but, ultimately, curtailed due to transmission congestion and inadequate demand. This work develops a power market model that allows hyperscalers to spatially migrate LLM inference workloads to geo-distributed modular datacenters (MDCs), which are co-located with near renewable sources of energy at the edge of the network. We introduce the optimization problems faced by the hyperscaler and MDCs in addition to consumers, producers, and the electric grid operator, where the hyerscaler enters an agreement to lease MDCs while ensuring that the required service level objectives (SLOs) are met. The overall market model is formulated as a complementarity problem, where the proof is provided showing the existence and uniqueness of the solutions. When applying the model to an IEEE RTS-24 bus case study, we show that even with a provision that requires MDCs to disclose the CO$_2$ emissions associated with their energy supply sources, renting less polluting MDCs is unlikely to yield meaningful emission reductions due to so-called contract-reshuffling. The situation can be mitigated when conventional loads are supplied by forward contracts through power purchase agreements. This also leads to a decline in system congestion when the hyperscaler becomes increasingly cost-aware.</description>

      <title>Self-Configurable Mesh-Networks for Scalable Distributed Submodular Bandit Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how to scale distributed bandit submodular coordination under realistic communication constraints in bandwidth, data rate, and connectivity. We are motivated by multi-agent tasks of active situational awareness in unknown, partially-observable, and resource-limited environments, where the agents must coordinate through agent-to-agent communication. Our approach enables scalability by (i) limiting information relays to only one-hop communication and (ii) keeping inter-agent messages small, having each agent transmit only its own action information. Despite these information-access restrictions, our approach enables near-optimal action coordination by optimizing the agents' communication neighborhoods over time, through distributed online bandit optimization, subject to the agents' bandwidth constraints. Particularly, our approach enjoys an anytime suboptimality bound that is also strictly positive for arbitrary network topologies, even disconnected. To prove the bound, we define the Value of Coordination (VoC), an information-theoretic metric that quantifies for each agent the benefit of information access to its neighbors. We validate in simulations the scalability and near-optimality of our approach: it is observed to converge faster, outperform benchmarks for bandit submodular coordination, and can even outperform benchmarks that are privileged with a priori knowledge of the environment.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Attack-Resilient CLF-Based Control of Nonlinear DC Microgrids under FDI Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing deployment of nonlinear, converter interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) in DC microgrids demands decentralized controllers that remain stable and resilient under a wide range of cyber-physical attacks and disturbances. Traditional droop or linearized control methods lack resilience and scalability, especially when the system operates in its nonlinear region or faces diverse false-data-injection (FDI) attacks on control inputs. In this work, we develop a Decentralized Attack-Resilient Control Lyapunov Function (AR-CLF) based Quadratic Program (QP) control framework for nonlinear DC microgrids that ensures large-signal stability in a fully decentralized manner. Built upon the port-Hamiltonian representation, the proposed controller dynamically compensates diverse attacks including exponentially unbounded control-input perturbations beyond the bounded-attack regime commonly assumed in existing methods, through an adaptive resilience term, without requiring global information. Simulations validate that the AR-CLF based QP controller achieves superior stability and resilience against unbounded attacks, paving the way for scalable, attack-resilient, and physically consistent control of next-generation DC microgrids.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning-based Transmission Expansion Framework Considering Strategic Bidding in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission expansion planning in electricity markets is tightly coupled with the strategic bidding behaviors of generation companies. This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based co-optimization framework that simultaneously learns transmission investment decisions and generator bidding strategies within a unified training process. Based on a multiagent RL framework for market simulation, the proposed method newly introduces a design policy layer that jointly optimizes continuous/discrete transmission expansion decisions together with strategic bidding policies. Through iterative interaction between market clearing and investment design, the framework effectively captures their mutual influence and achieves consistent co-optimization of expansion and bidding decisions. Case studies on the IEEE 30-bus system are provided for proof-of-concept validation of the proposed co-optimization framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel computationally efficient algorithm for optimal sizing of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) considering renewable energy bidding strategies. Unlike existing two-stage methods, our algorithm enables the cooptimization of both by updating the BESS size during the training of the bidding policy, leveraging an extended reinforcement learning (RL) framework inspired by advancements in embodied cognition. By integrating the Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) with a distributed RL framework, the proposed algorithm effectively manages uncertainties in renewable generation and market prices while enabling parallel computation for efficiently handling long-term data.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a mixed H-infinity-passivity framework that enables district heating systems (DHSs) with heat pumps to support electric-grid frequency regulation. The analysis illustrates how the DHS regulator influences coupled electro-thermal frequency dynamics and provides LMI conditions for efficient controller design. We also present a disturbance-independent temperature regulator that ensures stability and robustness against heat-demand uncertainty. Simulations demonstrate improved frequency-control dynamics in the electrical power grid while maintaining good thermal performance in the DHS.</description>

      <title>Co-Optimization of Network Topology and Variable Impedance Devices under Dynamic Line Ratings in Power Transmission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system operators are increasingly deploying Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) to mitigate operational challenges such as line and transformer congestion, and voltage violations. These technologies, including Network Topology Optimization (NTO), Variable Impedance Devices (VIDs), and Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), enhance system flexibility and enable better utilization of existing network assets. However, as the deployment of multiple GETs grows, effective coordination among them becomes essential to fully realize their potential benefits. This paper presents a co-optimization framework that models and coordinates NTO, VID, and DLR within a unified optimization scheme to alleviate network congestion and minimize operational costs. The NTO formulation is developed using a node-breaker model, offering finer switching granularity and improved operational flexibility. The inclusion of VIDs introduces nonlinear and non-convex relationships in the optimization problem. DLR takes into account of weather conditions, primarily wind speed and ambient temperature, enabling adaptive utilization of transmission capacity. The proposed framework is validated on standard IEEE benchmark test systems, demonstrating its effectiveness under varying numbers and placements of impedance controllers.</description>

      <title>Multicellular Feedback Control Strategies in Synthetic Microbial Consortia: From Embedded to Distributed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living organisms rely on endogenous feedback mechanisms to maintain homeostasis in the presence of uncertainty and environmental fluctuations. An emerging challenge at the interface of control systems engineering and synthetic biology is the design of reliable feedback strategies to regulate cellular behavior and collective biological functions. In this article, we review recent advances in multicellular feedback control, where sensing, computation, and actuation are distributed across different cell populations within synthetic microbial consortia, giving rise to biological multiagent control systems governed by molecular communication. From a control-theoretic perspective, these consortia can be interpreted as distributed biomolecular control systems, where coordination among populations replace embedded regulation. We survey theoretical frameworks, control architectures, and modeling approaches, ranging from aggregate population-level dynamics to spatially aware agent-based simulations, and discuss experimental demonstrations in engineered \textit{Escherichia coli} consortia. We highlight how distributing control functions across populations can reduce metabolic burden, mitigate retroactivity, improve robustness to uncertainty, and enable modular reuse of control components. Beyond regulation of gene expression, we discuss the emerging problem of population composition control, where coordination among growing and competing cell populations becomes an integral part of the control objective. Finally, we outline key open challenges that must be addressed before multicellular control strategies can be deployed in real-world applications such as biomanufacturing, environmental remediation, and therapeutic systems. These challenges span modeling and simulation, experimental platform development, coordination and composition control, and long-term evolutionary stability.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and accurate load flow calculations are a bedrock of modern power system operation. Classical numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson algorithm provide highly precise results but are computationally demanding, which limits their applicability in large-scale scenario studies and optimization in time-critical contexts. Research has shown that machine learning approaches can approximate load flow results with high accuracy while substantially reducing computation time.
  Sample efficiency, i.e., the ability to achieve high accuracy with limited training dataset size, is still insufficiently researched, especially in grids with a fixed topology. This paper presents a systematic investigation of the sample efficiency of a Multilayer Perceptron and two Graph Neural Network variants on a dataset based on a modified IEEE 5-bus system. The results for this grid size show that Graph Neural Networks achieve the lowest losses. However, the availability of large training datasets remains the dominant factor influencing performance compared to architecture choice.</description>

      <title>High-Altitude Platforms in the Low-Altitude Economy: Bridging Communication, Computing, and Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) is rapidly emerging as a new technological and industrial frontier, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and aerial swarms increasingly deployed in logistics, infrastructure inspection, security, and emergency response. However, the large-scale development of the LAE demands a reliable aerial foundation that ensures not only real-time connectivity and computational support, but also navigation integrity and safe airspace management for safety-critical operations. High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs), positioned at around 20 km, provide a unique balance between wide-area coverage and low-latency responsiveness. Compared with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, HAPs are closer to end users and thus capable of delivering millisecond-level connectivity, fine-grained regulatory oversight, and powerful onboard computing and caching resources. Beyond connectivity and computation, HAPs-assisted sensing and regulation further enable navigation integrity and airspace trust, which are essential for safety-critical UAV and eVTOL operations in the LAE. This article proposes a five-stage evolutionary roadmap for HAPs in the LAE: from serving as aerial infrastructure bases, to becoming super back-ends for UAV, to acting as frontline support for ground users, further enabling swarm-scale UAV coordination, and ultimately advancing toward edge-air-cloud closed-loop autonomy. In parallel, HAPs complement LEO satellites and cloud infrastructures to form a global-regional-local three-tier architecture. Looking forward, HAPs are expected to evolve from simple platforms into intelligent hubs, emerging as pivotal nodes for air traffic management, intelligent logistics, and emergency response. By doing so, they will accelerate the transition of the LAE toward large-scale deployment, autonomy, and sustainable growth.</description>

      <title>Rendezvous and Docking of Mobile Ground Robots for Efficient Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-Motion physical coupling of multiple mobile ground robots has the potential to enable new applications like in-motion transfer that improves efficiency in handling and transferring goods, which tackles current challenges in logistics. A key challenge lies in achieving reliable autonomous in-motion physical coupling of two mobile ground robots starting at any initial position. Existing approaches neglect the modeling of the docking interface and the strategy for approaching it, resulting in uncontrolled collisions that make in-motion physical coupling either impossible or inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose a central mpc approach that explicitly models the dynamics and states of two omnidirectional wheeled robots, incorporates constraints related to their docking interface, and implements an approaching strategy for rendezvous and docking. This novel approach enables omnidirectional wheeled robots with a docking interface to physically couple in motion regardless of their initial position. In addition, it makes in-motion transfer possible, which is 19.75% more time- and 21.04% energy-efficient compared to a non-coupling approach in a logistic scenario.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Tube-Based MPC Framework with Hard Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a stochastic tube-based model predictive control framework that guarantees hard input constraint satisfaction for linear systems subject to unbounded additive disturbances. The approach relies on a structured design of probabilistic reachable sets that explicitly incorporates actuator saturation into the error dynamics and bounds the resulting nonlinearity within a convex embedding. The proposed controller retains the computational efficiency and structural advantages of stochastic tube-based approaches while ensuring state chance constraint satisfaction alongside hard input limits. Recursive feasibility and mean-square stability are established for our scheme, and a numerical example illustrates its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Edge-based Synchronization over Signed Digraphs with Multiple Leaders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the edge-based synchronization problem in first-order multi-agent systems containing both cooperative and antagonistic interactions with one or multiple leader groups. The presence of multiple leaders and antagonistic interactions means that the multi-agent typically does not achieve consensus, unless specific conditions (on the number of leaders and on the signed graph) are met, in which case the agents reach a trivial form of consensus. In general, we show that the multi-agent system exhibits a more general form of synchronization, including bipartite consensus and containment. Our approach uses the signed edge-based agreement protocol for signed networks described by signed edge-Laplacian matrices. In particular, in this work, we present new spectral properties of signed edge-Laplacian matrices containing multiple zero eigenvalues and establish global exponential stability of the synchronization errors. Moreover, we compute the equilibrium to which all edge states converge. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Robust Taylor-Lagrange Control for Safety-Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving safety-critical control problem has widely adopted the Control Barrier Function (CBF) method. However, the existence of a CBF is only a sufficient condition for system safety. The recently proposed Taylor-Lagrange Control (TLC) method addresses this limitation, but is vulnerable to the feasibility preservation problem (e.g., inter-sampling effect). In this paper, we propose a robust TLC (rTLC) method to address the feasibility preservation problem. Specifically, the rTLC method expands the safety function at an order higher than the relative degree of the function using Taylor's expansion with Lagrange remainder, which allows the control to explicitly show up at the current time instead of the future time in the TLC method. The rTLC method naturally addresses the feasibility preservation problem with only one hyper-parameter (the discretization time interval size during implementation), which is much less than its counterparts. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed rTLC method through an adaptive cruise control problem, and compare it with existing safety-critical control methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how informativity and identifiability for networks of dynamical systems can be investigated using Gr\"obner bases. We provide a sufficient condition for informativity in terms of positive definiteness of the spectrum of external signals and full generic rank of the transfer function relating the external signals to the inputs of the predictor. Moreover, we show how generic local network identifiability can be investigated by computing the dimension of the fiber associated with the closed loop transfer function from external measurable signals to the measured outputs.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Scalable and Robust Optical Systems Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AgentOptics, an agentic AI framework for high-fidelity, autonomous optical system control built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). AgentOptics interprets natural language tasks and executes protocol-compliant actions on heterogeneous optical devices through a structured tool abstraction layer. We implement 64 standardized MCP tools across 8 representative optical devices and construct a 410-task benchmark to evaluate request understanding, role-aware responses, multi-step coordination, robustness to linguistic variation, and error handling. We assess two deployment configurations--commercial online LLMs and locally hosted open-source LLMs--and compare them with LLM-based code generation baselines. AgentOptics achieves 87.7%--99.0% average task success rates, significantly outperforming code-generation approaches, which reach up to 50% success. We further demonstrate broader applicability through five case studies extending beyond device-level control to system orchestration, monitoring, and closed-loop optimization. These include DWDM link provisioning and coordinated monitoring of coherent 400 GbE and analog radio-over-fiber (ARoF) channels; autonomous characterization and bias optimization of a wideband ARoF link carrying 5G fronthaul traffic; multi-span channel provisioning with launch power optimization; closed-loop fiber polarization stabilization; and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)-based fiber monitoring with LLM-assisted event detection. These results establish AgentOptics as a scalable, robust paradigm for autonomous control and orchestration of heterogeneous optical systems.</description>

      <title>Design and Biomechanical Evaluation of a Lightweight Low-Complexity Soft Bilateral Ankle Exoskeleton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many people could benefit from exoskeleton assistance during gait, for either medical or nonmedical purposes. But exoskeletons bring added mass and structure, which in turn require compensating for. In this work, we present a lightweight, low-complexity, soft bilateral ankle exoskeleton for plantarflexion assistance, with a shoe attachment design that can be mounted on top of any pair of shoes. Experimental tests show no significant difference in lower limb kinematics and kinetics when wearing the exoskeleton in zero-torque mode relative to not wearing an exoskeleton, showing that our device does not obstruct healthy gait, and proving it as a compliant and comfortable device, promising to provide effective assistance. Hence, a control system was developed, and additional tests are underway.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Dimensional Closed-Loop Inverse Kinematics for Soft Robots via Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While kinematic inversion is a purely geometric problem for fully actuated rigid robots, it becomes extremely challenging for underactuated soft robots with infinitely many degrees of freedom. Closed-loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) schemes address this by introducing end-to-end mappings from actuation to task space for the controller to operate on, but typically assume finite dimensions of the underlying virtual configuration space. In this work, we extend CLIK to the infinite-dimensional domain to reason about the entire soft robot shape while solving tasks. We do this by composing an actuation-to-shape map with a shape-to-task map, deriving the differential end-to-end kinematics via an infinite-dimensional chain rule, and thereby obtaining a Jacobian-based CLIK algorithm. Since the actuation-to-shape mapping is rarely available in closed form, we propose to learn it from simulation data using neural operator networks, which are differentiable. We first present an analytical study on a constant-curvature segment, and then apply the neural version of the algorithm to a three-fiber soft robotic arm whose underlying model relies on morphoelasticity and active filament theory. This opens new possibilities for differentiable control of soft robots by exploiting full-body shape information in a continuous, infinite-dimensional framework.</description>

      <title>HONEST-CAV: Hierarchical Optimization of Network Signals and Trajectories for Connected and Automated Vehicles with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a hierarchical, network-level traffic flow control framework for mixed traffic consisting of Human-driven Vehicles (HVs), Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). The framework jointly optimizes vehicle-level eco-driving behaviors and intersection-level traffic signal control to enhance overall network efficiency and decrease energy consumption. A decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach by Value Decomposition Network (VDN) manages cycle-based traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections, while an innovative Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) prediction method integrates a Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) to guide CAVs in executing Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) maneuvers. The framework is evaluated across varying CAV proportions and powertrain types to assess its effects on mobility and energy performance. Experimental results conducted in a 4*4 real-world network demonstrate that the MARL-based TSC method outperforms the baseline model (i.e., Webster method) in speed, fuel consumption, and idling time. In addition, with MLTPA, HONEST-CAV benefits the traffic system further in energy consumption and idling time. With a 60% CAV proportion, vehicle average speed, fuel consumption, and idling time can be improved/saved by 7.67%, 10.23%, and 45.83% compared with the baseline. Furthermore, discussions on CAV proportions and powertrain types are conducted to quantify the performance of the proposed method with the impact of automation and electrification.</description>

      <title>RotorSuite: A MATLAB/Simulink Toolbox for Tilt Multi-Rotor UAV Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, aerial platforms have evolved from passive flying sensors into versatile, contact-aware robotic systems, leading to rapid advances in platform design. Standard coplanar and collinear quadrotors have been complemented by modern tilted and tilting multi-rotor platforms with enhanced maneuverability. To properly analyze, control, and validate the performance of these emerging platforms, an accurate modeling step is required; however, this can be time-consuming, user-dependent and error-prone. To address this issue, we propose a MATLAB/Simulink toolbox for modeling and simulating the dynamics of a broad class of multi-rotor platforms through both an analytical and physics-based approaches. The toolbox, named RotorSuite, is provided with comprehensive documentation and example use cases, representing a valuable tool for didactic, research, and industrial development purposes.</description>

      <title>Depth-Enhanced YOLO-SAM2 Detection for Reliable Ballast Insufficiency Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework for detecting ballast insufficiency in railway tracks using RGB-D data. Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.
  Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80. These results demonstrate that integrating depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 yields a more robust and reliable approach for automated railway ballast inspection, particularly in visually ambiguous or safety-critical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Distributed and Consistent Multi-Robot Visual-Inertial-Ranging Odometry on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable localization is a fundamental requirement for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) provides lightweight and accurate motion estimation but suffers from cumulative drift in the absence of global references. Ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging offers complementary global observations, yet most existing UWB-aided VIO methods are designed for single-robot scenarios and rely on pre-calibrated anchors, which limits their robustness in practice. This paper proposes a distributed collaborative visual-inertial-ranging odometry (DC-VIRO) framework that tightly fuses VIO and UWB measurements across multiple robots. Anchor positions are explicitly included in the system state to address calibration uncertainty, while shared anchor observations are exploited through inter-robot communication to provide additional geometric constraints. By leveraging a right-invariant error formulation on Lie groups, the proposed approach preserves the observability properties of standard VIO, ensuring estimator consistency. Simulation results with multiple robots demonstrate that DC-VIRO significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness, while simultaneously enabling anchor self-calibration in distributed settings.</description>

      <title>Distributional Stability of Tangent-Linearized Gaussian Inference on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian inference on smooth manifolds is central to robotics, but exact marginalization and conditioning are generally non-Gaussian and geometry-dependent. We study tangent-linearized Gaussian inference and derive explicit non-asymptotic $W_2$ stability bounds for projection marginalization and surface-measure conditioning. The bounds separate local second-order geometric distortion from nonlocal tail leakage and, for Gaussian inputs, yield closed-form diagnostics from $(\mu,\Sigma)$ and curvature/reach surrogates. Circle and planar-pushing experiments validate the predicted calibration transition near $\sqrt{\|\Sigma\|_{\mathrm{op}}}/R\approx 1/6$ and indicate that normal-direction uncertainty is the dominant failure mode when locality breaks. These diagnostics provide practical triggers for switching from single-chart linearization to multi-chart or sample-based manifold inference.</description>

      <title>Strategic Gaussian Signaling under Linear Sensitivity Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes Stackelberg Gaussian signaling games under linear sensitivity mismatch, generalizing standard additive and constant-bias models. We characterize the Stackelberg equilibrium structure for both noiseless and noisy signaling regimes. In the noiseless case, we show that the encoder selectively reveals information along specific eigenspaces of a cost-mismatch matrix. We then extend the analysis to the noisy regime and derive analytical thresholds for the existence of informative equilibria, demonstrating a sharp phase transition where communication collapses into silence if the sensitivity mismatch is sufficiently high, in contrast with the fully revealing equilibria often found in constant-bias models.</description>

      <title>Where Should Robotaxis Operate? Strategic Network Design for Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) services creates new opportunities to improve the efficiency and reliability of on-demand mobility systems. Unlike human-driven Mobility-on-Demand (MoD), AMoD enables fully centralized fleet control, but it also requires appropriate infrastructure, so that vehicles can operate safely only on a suitably instrumented subnetwork of the roads. Most existing AMoD research focuses on fleet control (matching, rebalancing, ridepooling) on a fixed road network and does not address the joint design of the service network and fleet capacity. In this paper, we formalize this strategic design problem as the Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Network Design Problem (AMoD-NDP), in which an operator selects an operation subnetwork and routes all passengers, subject to infrastructure and fleet constraints and route-level quality-of-service requirements. We propose a path-based mixed-integer formulation of the AMoD-NDP and develop a column-generation-based algorithm that scales to city-sized networks. The master problem optimizes over a restricted set of paths, while the pricing problem reduces to an elementary shortest path with resource constraints, solved exactly by a tailored label-correcting algorithm. The method provides an explicit certificate of the optimality gap and extends naturally to a robust counterpart under box uncertainty in travel times and demand. Using real-world data from Manhattan, New York City, we show that the framework produces stable and interpretable operation subnetworks, quantifies trade-offs between infrastructure investment and fleet time, and accommodates additional path-level constraints, such as limits on left turns as a proxy for operational risk. These results illustrate how the proposed approach can support strategic planning and policy analysis for future AMoD deployments.</description>

      <title>Design and Control of Modular Magnetic Millirobots for Multimodal Locomotion and Shape Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modular small-scale robots offer the potential for on-demand assembly and disassembly, enabling task-specific adaptation in dynamic and constrained environments. However, existing modular magnetic platforms often depend on workspace collisions for reconfiguration, employ bulky three-dimensional electromagnetic systems, and lack robust single-module control, which limits their applicability in biomedical settings. In this work, we present a modular magnetic millirobotic platform comprising three cube-shaped modules with embedded permanent magnets, each designed for a distinct functional role: a free module that supports self-assembly and reconfiguration, a fixed module that enables flip-and-walk locomotion, and a gripper module for cargo manipulation. Locomotion and reconfiguration are actuated by programmable combinations of time-varying two-dimensional uniform and gradient magnetic field inputs. Experiments demonstrate closed-loop navigation using real-time vision feedback and A* path planning, establishing robust single-module control capabilities. Beyond locomotion, the system achieves self-assembly, multimodal transformations, and disassembly at low field strengths. Chain-to-gripper transformations succeeded in 90% of trials, while chain-to-square transformations were less consistent, underscoring the role of module geometry in reconfiguration reliability. These results establish a versatile modular robotic platform capable of multimodal behavior and robust control, suggesting a promising pathway toward scalable and adaptive task execution in confined environments.</description>

      <title>Federated Causal Representation Learning in State-Space Systems for Decentralized Counterfactual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of interdependent industrial assets (clients) are tightly coupled through physical processes and control inputs, raising a key question: how would the output of one client change if another client were operated differently? This is difficult to answer because client-specific data are high-dimensional and private, making centralization of raw data infeasible. Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences. A central server estimates the global state-transition and control structure. This enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning where clients predict how outputs would change under alternative control inputs at others while only exchanging compact latent states. We prove convergence to a centralized oracle and provide privacy guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate scalability, and accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control system datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing network resilience through topological switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies how to preemptively increase the resilience of a network by means of time-varying topological actuation. To do this, we focus on linear dynamical systems that are compatible with a given network, and consider policies that switch periodically between the given one and an alternative, topologically-compatible dynamics. In particular, we seek to solve design problems aimed at finding a) the optimal switching schedule between two preselected topologies, and b) an optimal topology and optimal switching schedule. By imposing periodicity, we first provide a metric of resilience in terms of the spectral abscissa of the averaged linear time-invariant dynamics. By restricting our policies to commutative networks, we then show how the optimal scheduling problem reduces to a convex optimization, providing a bound on the net resilience that can be achieved. After this, we find that the optimal, sparse commutative network to switch with is fully disconnected and allocates the spectral sum among the nodes of the network equally. We then impose additional restrictions on topology edge selection, which leads to a biconvex optimization for which certain matrix rank conditions guide the choice of weighting parameters to obtain desirable solutions. Finally, we provide two methods to solve this problem efficiently (based on a McCormick relaxation, and alternating minimization), and illustrate the results in simulations.</description>

      <title>Bellman Value Decomposition for Task Logic in Safe Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world tasks involve nuanced combinations of goal and safety specifications. In high dimensions, the challenge is exacerbated: formal automata become cumbersome, and the combination of sparse rewards tends to require laborious tuning. In this work, we consider the innate structure of the Bellman Value as a means to naturally organize the problem for improved automatic performance. Namely, we prove the Bellman Value for a complex task defined in temporal logic can be decomposed into a graph of Bellman Values, connected by a set of well-known Bellman equations (BEs): the Reach-Avoid BE, the Avoid BE, and a novel type, the Reach-Avoid-Loop BE. To solve the Value and optimal policy, we propose VDPPO, which embeds the decomposed Value graph into a two-layer neural net, bootstrapping the implicit dependencies. We conduct a variety of simulated and hardware experiments to test our method on complex, high-dimensional tasks involving heterogeneous teams and nonlinear dynamics. Ultimately, we find this approach greatly improves performance over existing baselines, balancing safety and liveness automatically.</description>

      <title>A Cooperative Multi-Agent Probabilistic Framework for Search and Track Missions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work a robust and scalable cooperative multi-agent searching and tracking framework is proposed. Specifically, we study the problem of cooperative searching and tracking of multiple moving targets by a group of autonomous mobile agents with limited sensing capabilities. We assume that the actual number of targets present is not known a priori and that target births/deaths can occur anywhere inside the surveillance region thus efficient search strategies are required to detect and track as many targets as possible. To address the aforementioned challenges we recursively compute and propagate in time the searching-and-tracking (SAT) density. Using the SAT-density, we then develop decentralized cooperative look-ahead strategies for efficient searching and tracking of an unknown number of targets inside a bounded surveillance area.</description>

      <title>Semi-on-Demand Hybrid Transit Route Design with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15804v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) enable transit agencies to design more agile and responsive services at lower operating costs. This study designs and evaluates a semi-on-demand hybrid route directional service in the public transit network, offering on-demand flexible route service in low-density areas and fixed route service in higher-density areas. We develop analytically tractable cost expressions that capture access, waiting, and riding costs for users, and distance-based operating and time-based vehicle costs for operators. Two formulations are presented for strategic and tactical decisions in flexible route portion, fleet size, headway, and vehicle size optimization, enabling the determination of route types between fixed, hybrid, and flexible routes based on demand, cost, and operational parameters. Analytical results demonstrate that the lower operating costs of SAVs favor more flexible route services. The practical applications and benefits of semi-on-demand feeders are presented with numerical examples and a large-scale case study in the Chicago metropolitan area, USA. Findings reveal scenarios in which flexible route portions serving passengers located further away reduce total costs, particularly user costs, whereas higher demand densities favor more traditional line-based operations. Current cost forecasts suggest smaller vehicles with fully flexible routes are optimal, but operating constraints or higher operating costs would favor larger vehicles with hybrid routes. The study provides an analytical tool to design SAVs as directional services and transit feeders, and tractable continuous approximation formulations for planning and research in transit network design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stability chamber is essential for pharmaceutical facilities to test the stability and quality of products over time by exposing them to different environmental conditions. This paper introduces an IoT-enabled stability chamber designed for the pharmaceutical industry. We constructed four stability chambers by leveraging the existing infrastructure within a manufacturing facility. Each chamber is controlled using a state-of-the-art Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) system based on the Siemens S7-1200 PLC. The Siemens WinCC Runtime Advanced platform, compliant with FDA 21 CFR Part 11, was used for visualizing chamber data. Additionally, an Internet of Things (IoT) application was developed to remotely monitor sensor data through any client application. This research aims to enhance the performance of traditional stability chambers by integrating IoT functionalities, making them more cost-effective and user-friendly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a feedback controller that minimizes the observability of a set of adversarial sensors of a linear system, while adhering to strict closed-loop performance constraints. We quantify the effectiveness of adversarial sensors using the trace of their observability Gramian and its inverse, capturing both average observability and the least observable state directions of the system. We derive theoretical lower bounds on these metrics under performance constraints, characterizing the fundamental limits of observability reduction as a function of the performance trade-off. Finally, we show that the performance-constrained optimization of the Gramian's trace can be formulated as a one-shot semidefinite program, while we address the optimization of its inverse through sequential semidefinite programming. Simulations on an aircraft show how the proposed scheme yields controllers that deteriorate adversarial observability while having near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Safe and Near-Optimal Control with Online Dynamics Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving both optimality and safety under unknown system dynamics is a central challenge in real-world deployment of agents. To address this, we introduce a notion of maximum safe dynamics learning, where sufficient exploration is performed within the space of safe policies. Our method executes $\textit{pessimistically}$ safe policies while $\textit{optimistically}$ exploring informative states and, despite not reaching them due to model uncertainty, ensures continuous online learning of dynamics. The framework achieves first-of-its-kind results: learning the dynamics model sufficiently $-$ up to an arbitrary small tolerance (subject to noise) $-$ in a finite time, while ensuring provably safe operation throughout with high probability and without requiring resets. Building on this, we propose an algorithm to maximize rewards while learning the dynamics $\textit{only to the extent needed}$ to achieve close-to-optimal performance. Unlike typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, our approach operates online in a non-episodic setting and ensures safety throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging domains such as autonomous car racing and drone navigation under aerodynamic effects $-$ scenarios where safety is critical and accurate modeling is difficult.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Therapist-in-the-loop robotic rehabilitation has shown great promise in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes by integrating the strengths of therapists and robotic systems. However, its broader adoption remains limited due to insufficient safe interaction and limited adaptation capability. This article proposes a novel telerobotics-mediated framework that enables therapists to intuitively and safely deliver assist-as-needed~(AAN) therapy based on two primary contributions. First, our framework encodes the therapist-informed corrective force into via-points in a latent space, allowing the therapist to provide only minimal assistance while encouraging patient maintaining own motion preferences. Second, a shape-adaptive ANN rehabilitation policy is learned to partially and progressively deform the reference trajectory for movement therapy based on encoded patient motion preferences and therapist-informed via-points. The effectiveness of the proposed shape-adaptive AAN strategy was validated on a telerobotic rehabilitation system using two representative tasks. The results demonstrate its practicality for remote AAN therapy and its superiority over two state-of-the-art methods in reducing corrective force and improving movement smoothness.</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-Agent Safety via Tube-Based Tightened Exponential Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a constructive framework for synthesizing provably safe controllers for nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to bounded disturbances. The methodology applies to systems representable in Brunovsky canonical form, accommodating arbitrary-order dynamics in multi-dimensional spaces. The central contribution is a method of constraint tightening that formally couples robust error feedback with nominal trajectory planning. The key insight is that the design of an ancillary feedback law, which confines state errors to a robust positively invariant (RPI) tube, simultaneously provides the exact information needed to ensure the safety of the nominal plan. Specifically, the geometry of the resulting RPI tube is leveraged via its support function to derive state-dependent safety margins. These margins are then used to systematically tighten the high relative-degree exponential control barrier function (eCBF) constraints imposed on the nominal planner. This integrated synthesis guarantees that any nominal trajectory satisfying the tightened constraints corresponds to a provably safe trajectory for the true, disturbed system. We demonstrate the practical utility of this formal synthesis method by implementing the planner within a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, which optimizes performance while inheriting the robust safety guarantees.</description>

Abstract: As modern power systems continue to evolve into multi-agent, converter-dominated systems that demand reliable, stable, and optimal control architectures within an expandable framework, this paper investigates scalable stability guarantees of a promising nonlinear communication-reliant control framework for DC microgrids. Particularly, relying on nested control loops; inner decentralized(primary) and outer distributed(secondary), the control configurations are designed to simultaneously achieve proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits, at the converged steady state. By enforcing sufficient time-scale separation at the boarder between the control loops, the system admits a singular perturbation formulation, allowing global exponential stability (G.E.S.) to be established via Lyapunov arguments. Although the theoretical G.E.S. certificate is structurally scalable, the stability guarantees depends on a sufficiently large permanent leakage, introduced in the primary controller. Thus, the results of this paper emphasize the importance of appropriate practical tuning guidelines and electrical parameter selection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through case studies on a low-voltage DC microgrid under load variations and topological changes (and communication time-delays), followed by a small-signal stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Equipment Monitoring via Cascaded Anomaly Detection and Saliency-Guided Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive maintenance demands accurate anomaly detection and actionable, interpretable explanations. While fusing sensor time-series with thermal imagery is promising, naive fusion can actually degrade performance. This paper provides evidence-based guidelines for interpretability-driven model selection, demonstrating that cascaded architectures outperform end-to-end fusion in industrial monitoring. We propose a two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses a Random Forest on statistical sensor features for robust anomaly detection (94.70% macro F1), while Stage 2 employs a convolutional thermal encoder with spatial attention for post-detection inspection. Rigorous analysis reveals traditional machine learning significantly outperforms deep learning baselines (Cohen's d = 3.04-8.81) on low-noise, filtered sensor data. Additionally, we introduce a diagnostic protocol using gate weight analysis to quantify modality bias, preventing over-reliance on visually rich but less informative data. Our explainability pipeline integrates Shapley-based sensor ranking with spatial attention. Finally, perturbation audits confirm thermal attention acts as a spatial regularizer, with the thermal encoder achieving a 78.49% fault-detection F1, demonstrating learned sensitivity to fault presence despite poor severity grading.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Control Technique for Switched LPV Systems and Its Application to Active Magnetic Bearing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel hybrid control framework for switched linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems under hysteresis switching logic. By introducing a controller state-reset mechanism, the hybrid LPV synthesis problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), enabling efficient computation of both switching LPV controller gains and reset matrices. The proposed approach is then applied to active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems, whose rotor dynamics exhibit strong dependence on rotational speed. Conventional LPV designs are often conservative due to large speed variations. The proposed hybrid gain-scheduled controller explicitly accounts for bounds on parameter variation rates, employs multiple LPV controllers over distinct operating regions, and uses hysteresis switching to reduce chattering and ensure stability. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a detailed AMB control design example.</description>

      <title>Learning-based data-enabled moving horizon estimation with application to membrane-based biological wastewater treatment process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-enabled moving horizon estimation (MHE) approach for nonlinear systems. While the approach is formulated by leveraging Koopman theory, its implementation does not require explicit Koopman modeling. Lifting functions are learned from the state and input data of the original nonlinear system to project the system trajectories into the lifted space, where the resulting trajectories implicitly describe the Koopman representation for the original nonlinear system. A convex data-enabled MHE formulation is developed to provide real-time state estimates of the Koopman representation, from which the states of the nonlinear system can be reconstructed. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the stability of the estimation error. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using a membrane-based biological water treatment process.</description>

      <title>Resource-Aware Distributed Submodular Maximization: A Paradigm for Multi-Robot Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07520v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-robot decision-making is the process where multiple robots coordinate actions. In this paper, we aim for efficient and effective multi-robot decision-making despite the robots' limited on-board resources and the often resource-demanding complexity of their tasks. We introduce the first algorithm enabling the robots to choose with which few other robots to coordinate and provably balance the trade-off of centralized vs. decentralized coordination. Particularly, centralization favors globally near-optimal decision-making but at the cost of increased on-board resource requirements; whereas, decentralization favors minimal resource requirements but at a global suboptimality cost. All robots can thus afford our algorithm, irrespective of their resources. We are motivated by the future of autonomy that involves multiple robots coordinating actions to complete resource-demanding tasks, such as target tracking, area coverage, and monitoring. To provide closed-form guarantees, we focus on maximization problems involving monotone and 2nd-order submodular functions. To capture the cost of decentralization, we introduce the notion of Centralization Of Information among non-Neighbors (COIN). We validate our algorithm in simulated scenarios of image covering.</description>

      <title>$O(1/k)$ Finite-Time Bound for Non-Linear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA) is an algorithm with coupled iterations which has found broad applications in reinforcement learning, optimization and game control. In this work, we derive mean squared error bounds for non-linear two-time-scale iterations with contractive mappings. In the setting where both stepsizes are order $\Theta(1/k)$, commonly referred to as single time-scale SA with multiple coupled sequences, we obtain the first $O(1/k)$ rate without imposing additional smoothness assumptions. In the setting with true time-scale separation, the previous best bound was $O(1/k^{2/3})$. We improve this to $O(1/k^a)$ for any $a&lt;1$ approaching the optimal $O(1/k)$ rate. The key step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an averaged noise sequence whose variance decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation. Our results apply to Polyak averaging, as well as to algorithms from reinforcement learning, and optimization, including gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization.</description>

      <title>A Digital Pheromone-Based Approach for In-Control/Out-of-Control Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In complex production lines, it is essential to have strict, fast-acting rules to determine whether the system is In Control (InC) or Out of Control (OutC). This study explores a bio-inspired method that digitally mimics ant colony behavior to classify InC/OutC states and forecast imminent transitions requiring maintenance. A case study on industrial potato chip frying provides the application context. During each two-minute frying cycle, sequences of eight temperature readings are collected. Each sequence is treated as a digital ant depositing virtual pheromones, generating a Base Score. New sequences, representing new ants, can either reinforce or weaken this score, leading to a Modified Base Score that reflects the system's evolving condition. Signals such as extreme temperatures, large variations within a sequence, or the detection of change-points contribute to a Threat Score, which is added to the Modified Base Score. Since pheromones naturally decay over time unless reinforced, an Environmental Score is incorporated to reflect recent system dynamics, imitating real ant behavior. This score is calculated from the Modified Base Scores collected over the past hour. The resulting Total Score, obtained as the sum of the Modified Base Score, Threat Score, and Environmental Score, is used as the main indicator for real-time system classification and forecasting of transitions from InC to OutC. This ant colony optimization-inspired approach provides an adaptive and interpretable framework for process monitoring and predictive maintenance in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Monitoring of Stochastic Fire Front Processes via Information-seeking Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptively monitoring a wildfire front using a mobile agent (e.g., a drone), whose trajectory determines where sensor data is collected and thus influences the accuracy of fire propagation estimation. This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. Subsequently, we transform the resulting nonlinear stochastic control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process and design an information-seeking predictive control law obtained via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.</description>
