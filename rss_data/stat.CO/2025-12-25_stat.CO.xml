      <title>Adjusted Kolmogorov Complexity of Binary Words with Empirical Entropy Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov complexity of a finite binary word reflects both algorithmic structure and the empirical distribution of symbols appearing in the word. Words with symbol frequencies far from one half have smaller combinatorial richness and therefore appear less complex under the standard definition. In this paper an entropy-normalized complexity measure is introduced that divides the Kolmogorov complexity of a word by the empirical entropy of its observed distribution of zeros and ones. This adjustment isolates intrinsic descriptive complexity from the purely combinatorial effect of symbol imbalance. For Martin L\"of random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. A pathological construction shows that regularity of the underlying measure is essential. The proposed framework connects Kolmogorov complexity, empirical entropy, and randomness in a natural manner and suggests applications in randomness testing and in the analysis of structured binary data.</description>

      <title>Smoothing Variances Across Time: Adaptive Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11315v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for estimating time-varying volatility by extending the Random Walk Stochastic Volatility (RWSV) model with Dynamic Shrinkage Processes (DSP) in log-variances. Unlike the classical Stochastic Volatility (SV) or GARCH-type models with restrictive parametric stationarity assumptions, our proposed Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV) model provides smooth yet dynamically adaptive estimates of evolving volatility and its uncertainty. We further enhance the model by incorporating a nugget effect, allowing it to flexibly capture small-scale variability while preserving smoothness elsewhere. We derive the theoretical properties of the global-local shrinkage prior DSP. Through simulation studies, we show that ASV exhibits remarkable misspecification resilience and low prediction error across various data-generating processes. Furthermore, ASV's capacity to yield locally smooth and interpretable estimates facilitates a clearer understanding of the underlying patterns and trends in volatility. As an extension, we develop the Bayesian Trend Filter with ASV (BTF-ASV) which allows joint modeling of the mean and volatility with abrupt changes. Finally, our proposed models are applied to time series data from finance, econometrics, and environmental science, highlighting their flexibility and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Modeling the uncertainty on the covariance matrix for probabilistic forecast reconciliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In forecast reconciliation, the covariance matrix of the base forecasts errors plays a crucial role. Typically, this matrix is estimated, and then treated as known. In contrast, we propose a Bayesian reconciliation model that accounts for the uncertainty in the estimation of the covariance matrix. This leads to a reconciled predictive distribution that follows a multivariate t-distribution, obtained in closed-form, rather than a multivariate Gaussian. We evaluate our method on three tourism-related datasets, including a new publicly available dataset. Empirical results show that our approach consistently improves prediction intervals compared to Gaussian reconciliation.</description>

      <title>Sequential Adaptive Priors for Orthogonal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel class of prior distributions for sequences of orthogonal functions, which are frequently required in various statistical models such as functional principal component analysis (FPCA). Our approach constructs priors sequentially by imposing adaptive orthogonality constraints through a hierarchical formulation of conditionally normal distributions. The orthogonality is controlled via hyperparameters, allowing for flexible trade-offs between exactness and smoothness, which can be learned from the observed data. We illustrate the properties of the proposed prior and show that it leads to nearly orthogonal posterior estimates. The proposed prior is employed in Bayesian FPCA, providing more interpretable principal functions and efficient low-rank representations. Through simulation studies and analysis of human mobility data in Tokyo, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in inducing orthogonality and improving functional component estimation.</description>

      <title>Divergence-based Robust Generalised Bayesian Inference for Directional Data via von Mises-Fisher models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focusses on robust estimation of location and concentration parameters of the von Mises-Fisher distribution in the Bayesian framework. The von Mises-Fisher (or Langevin) distribution has played a central role in directional statistics. Directional data have been investigated for many decades, and more recently, they have gained increasing attention in diverse areas such as bioinformatics and text data analysis. Although outliers can significantly affect the estimation results even for directional data, the treatment of outliers remains an unresolved and challenging problem. In the frequentist framework, numerous studies have developed robust estimation methods for directional data with outliers, but, in contrast, only a few robust estimation methods have been proposed in the Bayesian framework. In this paper, we propose Bayesian inference based on the density power divergence and the $\gamma$-divergence and establish their asymptotic properties and robustness. In addition, the Bayesian approach naturally provides a way to assess estimation uncertainty through the posterior distribution, which is particularly useful for small samples. Furthermore, to carry out the posterior computation, we develop the posterior computation algorithm based on the weighted Bayesian bootstrap for estimating parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through simulation studies. Using two real datasets, we further show that the proposed method provides reliable and robust estimation even in the presence of outliers or data contamination.</description>

      <title>Koenigs functions in the subcritical and critical Markov branching processes with Poisson probability reproduction of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Special functions have always played a central role in physics and in mathematics, arising as solutions of nonlinear differential equations, as well as in the theory of branching processes, which extensively uses probability generating functions. The theory of iteration of real functions leads to limit theorems for the discrete-time and real-time Markov branching processes. The Poisson reproduction of particles in real time is analysed through the integration of the Kolmogorov equation. These results are further extended by employing graphical representations of Koenigs functions under subcritical and critical branching mechanisms. The limit conditional law in the subcritical case and the invariant measure for the critical case are discussed, as well. The obtained explicit solutions contain the exponential Bell polynomials and the modified exponential-integral function $\rm{Ein} (z)$.</description>
