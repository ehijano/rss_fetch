      <title>First non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the first non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment using a novel method based on the rate of change of a supercurrent first proposed in 2016~\cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1604.02152} and fleshed out in this current paper. The theory, experimental concept and implementation are described in detail. The non-zero nuclear electric dipole moment measured with over 1000 hours of data was that of $^{181}$Ta producing a best value $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm0.31_\text{stat})\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}$ and $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm3.18)\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}&gt;0$ at 99.985\%CL. There is an uncertainty on the value of overall multiplicative parameters such as the self-inductance of the superconducting circuit ($\pm4\%$), the mutual inductance between the SQUID pickup coil and the sample wire ($\pm15\%$), and the magnitude of the solenoid current ($\pm5\%$). An upper-limit was estimated for the control element, $^{207}$Pb, $|d_\text{e}^\text{Pb}|\lesssim1.2\cdot10^{-31}e\cdot\text{cm}$ at 95\%CL.</description>

      <title>Threshold $J/\psi$ Photoproduction as a Probe of Nuclear Gluon Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear EMC effect is the observation that quark distributions in bound nucleons experience significant modification at large $x$ relative to free nucleons. Despite decades of measurements verifying the presence of this effect in quarks across a wide range of nuclei, behavior of large-$x$ gluons in nuclei remains almost completely unknown. As the nuclear physics community seeks out new observables to try to elucidate the mechanisms behind the EMC effect, it becomes striking that we remain ignorant regarding the impact of nuclear effects on gluonic behavior.
  Recent photonuclear data using the Hall D photon beam have enabled the first measurement of $J/\psi$ photoproduction from nuclei near and below the energy threshold, with the results highlighted in Physical Review Letters as an Editors' Suggestion. These data have placed the first, and currently only, constraints on the behavior of large-$x$ gluons within bound nucleons. However, compared to the quantity of data which currently informs our knowledge of the quark-sector EMC effect, these data are extremely limited, and remain unable to conclusively observe or exclude large modification of gluon distributions.
  A high-luminosity photonuclear experiment will enable a precision measurement of incoherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction at and below the threshold region. This data will provide the first stringent constraints on nuclear modification of gluon structure or other exotic effects which could impact the production of $J/\psi$ from nuclei.
  We request 85 PAC days at Hall D using the GlueX detector with a 12 GeV electron beam energy and a coherent photon peak energy of $8$ GeV, split into 80 days using a $^4$He target and 5 calibration days using a $^2$H target.</description>

      <title>The Roper resonance and kin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the Roper resonance N(1440) are reviewed. Quark models have long struggled to reproduce its mass relative to its negative-parity partner N(1535). This discrepancy motivated interpretations of the Roper as a dynamically generated meson-baryon state. Including its isospin partners Delta(1600) and Delta(1700) further accentuates the tension between quark-model predictions and experiment. Recent developments based on AdS/QCD and functional methods achieve much improved agreement, identifying the Roper as an ordinary three-quark excitation. Electroproduction experiments at Jefferson Lab have now resolved this long-standing question, revealing the Roper as a qqq core dressed by a substantial meson cloud. The Roper resonance belongs to a family of four N* states with JP = 1/2+; the highest-mass member, N(2100), likely represents a Roper-like excitation in the fourth shell.</description>

      <title>Neutron capture measurement of the 165Ho at the CSNS Backn facility in the resonance energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron capture yield of 165Ho have been measured at the Back-streaming White neutron beam line (Back-n) of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) using a 4{\pi} BaF2 Gamma Total Absorption Facility (GTAF). The resonance shapes in the 1eV to 1.0keV region were analyzed with the Bayesian R-matrix code SAMMY. For 18 s-wave resonances below 100eV, the resonance energy ER, neutron width {\Gamma}n, and radiative width {\Gamma}{\gamma} were extracted. The statistical analyses of the resonance parameters show that the nearest-neighbour level-spacing distribution follows a Wigner-Dyson form with mean spacing D0 = 4.53(3)eV,indicating chaotic compound-nucleus behaviour; Using the extracted parameters, the s-wave neutron strength function for 165Ho was derived to be 10-4S0 = 2.01(1), in excellent agreement with the values reported in both the Atlas of Neutron Resonances and ENDF/B-VIII.0 data.</description>

      <title>Using the Neutron Fizeau Effect and Neutron Interferometry to Measure Energy-Dependent Contributions to the Neutron Optical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to measure the energy dependence of the neutron optical potential $dV_{opt}/dE$ in the slow neutron energy regime. Our method makes essential use of a special property of the phase shift for a nonrelativistic neutron in moving matter, known as the neutron Fizeau effect. If a neutron traverses a medium which moves along the surfaces of its own parallel boundaries, the neutron only experiences a phase shift if the neutron optical potential of matter depends on the incident neutron energy. This feature of the neutron Fizeau effect can be combined with newly-developed forms of neutron interferometry to conduct sensitive measurements of $dV_{opt}/dE$. We describe some examples of scientific applications of this idea in the fields of neutron optics, subthreshold neutron-nucleus resonances, parity violation in low-energy p-wave neutron-nucleus resonances, and neutron scattering amplitudes of the nuclei of rare earth elements.</description>

      <title>New Hypernuclei Measurements from STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypernuclei are bound states of hyperons (Y) and nucleons (N). Measurements on their yields can help us investigate their production mechanisms. In particular, the ${}^5_{\Lambda}$He and $^{4}_{\Lambda}$H(e) are bounded substantially tighter compared to the $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H. The large radius of the $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H leads to suppression in coalescence models, but not in the thermal model where the size of the nucleus does not play a role. As such, studying the $A=3$--5 hypernuclei yields allow us to extract information on the effects of hypernuclear binding on hypernuclei production in heavy-ion collisions.
  In these proceedings, we present measurements of ${}^5_{\Lambda}$He yields in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0$ GeV, $^{4}_{\Lambda}$H(e) yields in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0$--$4.5$ GeV, and $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H yields in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$--$27$ GeV. Results on the directed flow of hypernuclei are also reported. The physics implications of these measurements are discussed.</description>

      <title>Determination of the Muon Lifetime in $^{76}$Se with the MONUMENT experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary muon capture provides a benchmark for the nuclear physics models of neutrinoless double beta decay under comparable momentum transfer conditions. The total capture strength defines the lifetime of the muonic atom. The muon lifetime in $^{76}$Se, the daughter nucleus of $^{76}$Ge, was determined with improved accuracy by the MONUMENT collaboration, using an array of high-purity germanium detectors and a set of scintillator counters at the $\pi$E1 muon beam line of the Paul Scherrer Institute. The new value of (135.1 $\pm$ 0.5) ns agrees with phenomenological calculations based on the quasiparticle random phase approximation with unquenched axial-vector coupling.</description>

      <title>First results from a search for axionlike dark matter using octupole-deformed nuclei in a crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the matter in the universe is in the form of dark matter. However, dark matter has never been observed to interact with normal matter in laboratory experiments. ALPs -- ultralight axionlike particles -- are a class of dark matter models that are consistent with astrophysical constraints, and produce measurable signatures in the form of oscillating violations of discrete symmetries in nuclei. We report the first results from a search for oscillating parity-odd time-reversal-odd nuclear moments of $^{153}$Eu ions in a crystal, which leads to an experimental constraint on the ALP-gluon coupling strength across a wide band of ALP masses.</description>

      <title>QCD in strong magnetic fields: fluctuations of conserved charges and EoS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields can profoundly affect the equilibrium properties, characterized by the equation of state and bulk thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter. Although such fields are expected in off-central heavy-ion collisions, directly measuring their experimental imprints remains extremely challenging. To address this, we propose the baryon-electric charge correlations $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ as magnetic-field-sensitive probes, based on (2+1)-flavor QCD lattice simulations at physical pion masses. Along the transition line, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb collisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \simeq 8M_\pi^2$, respectively. To bridge theoretical predictions and experimental observations, we construct HRG-based proxies and apply systematic kinematic cuts to emulate STAR and ALICE detector acceptances. Furthermore, we extend this investigation to the QCD equation of state, and examine the leading-order thermodynamic coefficients for strangeness-neutral scenarios up to $eB \simeq 0.8 {\rm GeV}^2 \sim 45 m_{\pi}^2$, revealing intriguing non-monotonic structures.</description>

      <title>Pairing gap as a new observable for critical points in the region of A=100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study used the pairing gap to identify nuclei as candidates for critical point symmetry around Z=40 and A=100. Nuclei around A = 100 display complex shape evolution and configuration crossing patterns. We utilized the experimental and algebraic frameworks of the interacting boson model and the newly developed interacting boson-fermion model to study the isotopes of Mo and Ru. The results show significant variations in these quantities across nuclei located at the E(5) and X(5) critical points, analyzed through different observables. We also examined another region that is suitable for a shape phase transition. Furthermore, our findings suggest new candidates for critical points in other phase transitional regions for different isotopic chains.</description>

      <title>Origin of the electric hexadecapole isomer in $^{93}$Mo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a shell-model analysis of $^{93}$Mo to investigate the unusual behavior of its ${21/2}^+$ isomer -- a prominent candidate for nuclear excitation by electronic capture. This state is unique as its decay is dominated by a slow electric hexadecapole $E4$ transition, while the typically much faster electric quadrupole $E2$ decay path is energetically forbidden. We investigate the microscopic origin of this phenomenon by examining in detail the structure of the wave functions of the initial and final states, and the $E4$ transition matrix elements. This analysis of $^{93}$Mo is contrasted with that of its particle-hole conjugate, $^{99}$Cd, where such an $E4$ transition is absent.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Flavor Fragmentation and Jet Structure from HF-NRevo: Bridging to Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present recent progress on the Heavy-Flavor Non-Relativistic Evolution (HF-NRevo) framework, designed to describe leading-power fragmentation of heavy-flavored hadrons at moderate to large transverse momentum. Starting from NLO NRQCD calculations for all partonic channels into pseudoscalar quarkonia, we construct the NRFF1.0 collinear fragmentation functions via DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We outline future prospects in the heavy-ion context, where HF-NRevo can serve as a baseline for modeling in-medium modifications of heavy-flavor fragmentation in nuclear collisions. Its accurate modeling of the partonic hierarchy and threshold effects makes it ideally suited to explore jet-quenching sensitivity, energy-loss mechanisms, and the emergence of medium-modified fragmentation functions in the quark-gluon plasma. Moreover, it provides a natural baseline for implementing in-medium hadronization scenarios, including quarkonium regeneration and fragmentation-function apparent-shape distortion. These developments provide new handles for exploring heavy-flavor dynamics at the HL-LHC and future collider facilities.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Generative Diffusion Model for Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collision physics has entered the high precision era, demanding theoretical models capable of generating huge statistics to compare with experimental data. However, traditional hybrid models, which combine hydrodynamics and hadronic transport, are computationally intensive, creating a significant bottleneck. In this work, we introduce DiffHIC, an end-to-end generative diffusion model, to emulate ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The model takes initial entropy density profiles and transport coefficients as input and directly generates two-dimensional final-state particle spectra. Our results demonstrate that DiffHIC achieves a computational speedup of approximately $10^5$ against traditional simulations, while accurately reproducing a wide range of physical observables, including integrated and differential anisotropic flow, multi-particle correlations, and momentum fluctuations. This framework provides a powerful and efficient tool for phenomenological studies in the high-precision era of heavy-ion physics.</description>

Abstract: Incorporating nuclear shell effects within the framework of orbital-free density functional theory (DFT) has remained a longstanding challenge in nuclear physics. While the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem formally guarantees the existence of an orbital-free density functional that is capable of describing all many-body effects, including shell effects, practical attempts since the 1970s have consistently failed to capture such effects. This persistent difficulty has even led to the misconception that the orbital-free DFT is inherently unable to describe nuclear shell effects. Here we develop a {\it non-local} orbital-free DFT approach for atomic nuclei and demonstrate that nuclear shell effects can be successfully incorporated into the orbital-free DFT through the construction of a non-local kinetic energy density functional. In particular, we show that the non-local orbital-free functional yields a nucleon localization function that, as an established indicator of shell effects, exhibits consistent behavior with the exact Kohn-Sham solution.</description>

Abstract: The objective of this pre-scientific paper is to analyze the crisis management during the Fukushima nuclear accident in the year of 2011 and to derive lessons for a safer operation of reactors along with a more resilient crisis management framework. In addition to official reports and subject literature, the conducted methods included interviews with an IAEA safeguard and a political scientist. The central findings were that the accident pointed out deficiencies regarding the independence of the regulatory body and that mismanagement of the available technical resources in conjunction with insufficient communication led to evitable evacuations.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin polarization from $\rho$ meson condensation in rotating hadronic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of vector mesons in extreme environments provides a unique probe of non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We investigate the conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of spin-1 $\rho$ mesons in dense rotating hadronic matter, a regime relevant to the peripheral heavy-ion collisions and the interiors of rapidly rotating neutron stars. When the $\rho$ meson chemical potential ($\mu_\rho$) approaches its effective mass ($m_\rho^*$), a phase transition to BEC occurs. We demonstrate that this transition is non-trivially influenced by global rotation, which couples to the spin of the $\rho$ mesons, leading to a macroscopic spin alignment of the condensate along the axis of rotation. This interplay between condensation and rotation results in distinct polarization patterns, which can serve as a possible signature of a BEC in experiments. The results suggest that rapidly rotating neutron stars may harbor an anisotropic, spin-polarized $\rho$-condensed phase, which could impact their equation of state.</description>

      <title>Search for Invisible Decay Modes in Nuclear Gamma Cascades of a ${}^{46}$Sc Source Using a CsI (Tl) Detector</title>

Abstract: Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in modern physics, motivating extensive searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Numerous experiments have probed a variety of dark matter candidates using diverse detector technologies, yet large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we present a novel high-statistics search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\gamma$ cascades, employing approximately 100~kg of CsI(Tl) scintillators at Texas A\&amp;M University. The key feature of this experiment is the use of a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source combined with a "missing gamma" technique, in which the absence of a photon in a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance--disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, thereby enabling sensitivity to weaker couplings. With approximately 1000~hours of data collected using the current setup, no statistically significant excess was observed, consistent with existing constraints on dark-sector candidates such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), dark scalars, and dark photons in the sub-MeV mass range. This result highlights the sensitivity of the missing-gamma technique and motivates the development of a larger-scale detector with improved systematic control to extend dark-sector searches into previously unexplored regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Particle Pair Correlation Functions with Classical Trajectory Approximation</title>

Abstract: Femtoscopic interferometry is a powerful tool for probing the spatio-temporal evolution of emission sources in heavy-ion collisions. A major challenge in the field is formulating a self-consistent description of the source function, final-state interactions between the particle pair, and interactions inherent to the source itself. To address this, we have developed a novel Monte Carlo model for calculating two-particle correlation functions in a classic framework. The model incorporates self-consistently the emission source of thermal equilibrium and three-body final state interactions. Application of the model shows satisfactory fit to experimental data, revealing that the correlation function is highly sensitive to the source's spatio-temporal extent. In contrast, the temperature parameter governing the emitted particles' energy spectra has a negligible influence. Our approach offers the potential to extract the spatio-temporal information from the emission source, thereby advancing the applicability of femtoscopic interferometry in the Fermi energy domain.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the ionization response of argon to nuclear recoils at the keV scale with the ReD experiment</title>

Abstract: In the recent years, argon-based experiments looking for Dark Matter in the Universe have explored the non-standard scenario in which Dark Matter is made by low-mass Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, of mass in the range of 1-10 GeV instead of the canonical hundreds of GeV. Detecting such particles is challenging, as their expected signatures are nuclear recoils with energies below 10 keV, observable solely via ionization. This necessitates a precise understanding of the detector response in this energy regime, which remains incomplete for argon. To address this, the ReD experiment was developed within the framework of the DarkSide-20k Collaboration to produce and characterize few-keV nuclear recoils. A compact dual-phase argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) was irradiated with neutrons from a Cf252 source, to produce Ar recoils in the energy range of interest via (n,n') elastic scattering. A downstream spectrometer composed of 18 plastic scintillators detected the neutrons scattered off Ar nuclei, enabling recoil energy reconstruction via two-body kinematics. The ionization yield Qy of argon, defined as the number of electrons produced per unit energy deposit, was measured in a model-independent way between 2 and 10 keV. These measurements extend direct experimental coverage well below the previous limit of approximately 7 keV. The results are consistent with existing data above 7 keV, while they indicate a higher Qy at lower energies.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensation and Dissipative Dynamics in a Relativistic Pion Gas</title>

Abstract: Pion condensation in ultra-relativistic collisions presents a compelling theoretical phenomenon with significant implications for the dynamics of hadronic matter. Various theoretical frameworks offer insight into the nature of high-temperature Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The present study investigates the dissipative behavior of a relativistic pion gas undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Further, we obtain viscosity ($\eta$), bulk viscosity ($\zeta$), and speed of sound ($c_s$) by employing the Boltzmann transport equation with the relaxation time approximation. Findings show a substantial drop in $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ with the fractional increase in condensation. This effect is becoming more evident in larger systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. Alongside the reduction in viscosities, the speed of sound also decreases with increasing condensation, indicating a softening of the equation of state. The analysis of finite-size effects reveals that larger systems exhibit more pronounced signatures of BEC. These results suggest that pion condensation can influence the hydrodynamic evolution of the hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions, with consequential implications for interpreting collective flow observables and the underlying equation of state.</description>

      <title>Extraction of ground-state nuclear deformations from ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions: Nuclear structure physics context</title>

Abstract: The collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has recently been used to characterize nuclear collective states. In this paper, we assess the foundations of the shape-imaging technique employed in these studies. We argue that some current UHIC nuclear imaging techniques neglect fundamental aspects of spontaneous symmetry-breaking and symmetry-restoration in colliding ions and incorrectly infer one-body multipole moments from studies of nucleonic correlations. Therefore, the impact of this approach on nuclear structure research has been overstated. Conversely, efforts to incorporate existing knowledge on nuclear shapes into analysis pipelines can be beneficial for benchmarking tools and calibrating models used to extract information from ultra-relativistic heavy-ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Electron Emissions and Hot spots in Dual-Phase LXe TPCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01023v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent photon and single-electron emissions - in the form of "electron trains" and localized "hot spots" - have been observed in multiple dual-phase liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. We show that these phenomena are naturally explained by photon-triggered single-electron emission from resistive mixed-oxide films on stainless-steel wires, which behave as leaky capacitors with long RC time constants at LXe temperature. Positive ions landing on these oxides can further enhance local fields and drive Malter-like electron emission. We outline the materials physics (Cr2O3 / Cr2O3-x / Cr(OH)3 mosaics), quantify expected time scales (~1 second under illumination), and demonstrate how small damaged regions with enhanced QE can produce persistent hot spots.</description>

      <title>Computing nuclear response functions with time-dependent coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute nuclear response functions by solving the time-dependent A-body Schr\"odinger equation, recording the time-dependent transition moment and extracting spectral information via Fourier transforms. The solution of the time-dependent many-body problem accounts for correlations on top of the mean field by taking advantage of a time-dependent formulation of coupled-cluster theory. As a validation, we focus on electric dipole transitions in $^4$He and $^{16}$O and compare moments of the response function distribution to the results of an equivalent static framework, finding negligible discrepancies. We investigate how proton and neutron densities evolve in time, and we see the traditional picture of soft and giant dipole resonances as collective oscillations of protons and neutrons emerging from our calculations in $^{16}$O and $^{24}$O. This method also allows us to investigate the behavior of the nucleus in the presence of a strong electric field. In that regime, the behavior of the system becomes chaotic. Qualitatively, the spectral information obtained in this limit is in line with previous time-dependent mean-field results.</description>
