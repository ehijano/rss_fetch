      <title>Towards Scientific Literacy in Inclusive Science Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03020v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific literacy, a central goal of modern science education, should be accessible to all students regardless of their backgrounds. Despite international education reforms focused on diversity, equity and inclusion many teachers struggle to create inclusive science lessons. One reason may be, that creating inclusive science lessons is challenging: it requires teachers to balance the demands of science education with the diverse needs of their students. Therefore, teachers need support in planning inclusive science lessons. To address this issue, members of a German network for inclusive science education (Netzwerk inklusiver naturwissenschaftlicher Unterricht, NinU) have developed the NinU framework. This framework integrates perspectives from both science education and inclusive pedagogy to support teachers in planning and reflecting inclusive science lessons. Originally created as a workshop resource for the NARST 2023 conference, this self-study manual provides 1) an overview of the theory behind the NinU framework, 2) examples and 3) exercises for acknowledging diversity, recognizing barriers and enabling participation using the framework.</description>

      <title>On cat-human interaction from the viewpoint of physics: an equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an enjoyable example through which several concepts of classical mechanics can be understood. We introduce an equation that models the motion of a cat in the presence of a person. The cat is considered as a point particle moving in a potential induced by the person. We demonstrate that this approach to the problem reproduces characteristic behaviors of these curious animals. For instance, the fact that cats do not typically come when they are called, or that they remain longer on the lap of their favorite person; even "zoomies" are reproduced (cats randomly run back and forth across the house). We use this model problem to explore topics of current research such as stochastic equations and periodically driven systems. The pedagogical value of this work and its potential use in teaching are discussed.</description>
