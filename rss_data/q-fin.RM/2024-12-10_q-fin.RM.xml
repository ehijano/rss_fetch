      <title>Tail Risk Alert Based on Conditional Autoregressive VaR by Regression Quantiles and Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the increasing application of AI in finance, this paper will leverage AI algorithms to examine tail risk and develop a model to alter tail risk to promote the stability of US financial markets, and enhance the resilience of the US economy. Specifically, the paper constructs a multivariate multilevel CAViaR model, optimized by gradient descent and genetic algorithm, to study the tail risk spillover between the US stock market, foreign exchange market and credit market. The model is used to provide early warning of related risks in US stocks, US credit bonds, etc. The results show that, by analyzing the direction, magnitude, and pseudo-impulse response of the risk spillover, it is found that the credit market's spillover effect on the stock market and its duration are both greater than the spillover effect of the stock market and the other two markets on credit market, placing credit market in a central position for warning of extreme risks. Its historical information on extreme risks can serve as a predictor of the VaR of other markets.</description>

      <title>Market Making in Spot Precious Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15478v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary challenge of market making in spot precious metals is navigating the liquidity that is mainly provided by futures contracts. The Exchange for Physical (EFP) spread, which is the price difference between futures and spot, plays a pivotal role and exhibits multiple modes of relaxation corresponding to the diverse trading horizons of market participants. In this paper, we model the EFP spread using a nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, in the spirit of the two-factor Hull-White model for interest rates. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework for maximizing the expected P\&amp;L of a market maker while minimizing inventory risk across both spot and futures. Using a computationally efficient technique to approximate the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem, our methodology facilitates strategy optimization on demand in near real-time, paving the way for advanced algorithmic market making that capitalizes on the co-integration properties intrinsic to the precious metals sector.</description>
