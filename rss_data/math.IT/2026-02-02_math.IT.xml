      <title>Capacity of Two-User Wireless Systems Aided by Movable Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable signals have emerged as a third approach to enable smart radio environments (SREs), complementing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and flexible antennas. This paper investigates their potential to enhance multi-user wireless systems. Focusing on two-user systems, we characterize the capacity regions of the multiple access channel (MAC) and broadcast channel (BC). Interestingly, movable signals can dynamically adjust the operating frequency to orthogonalize the user channels, thereby significantly expanding the capacity regions. We also study frequency optimization, constraining it in a limited frequency range, and show that movable signals provide up to 45% sum rate gain over fixed signals.</description>

      <title>5G LDPC Codes as Root LDPC Codes via Diversity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the diversity of protographbased quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes over nonergodic block-fading channels under iterative beliefpropagation decoding. We introduce diversity evolution (DivE), a Boolean-function-based analysis method that tracks how the fading dependence of belief-propagation messages evolves across decoding iterations. Under a Boolean approximation of block fading, DivE derives a Boolean fading function for each variable node (VN) output (i.e., the a-posteriori reliability after iterative decoding), from which the VN diversity order can be directly determined. Building on this insight, we develop a greedy blockmapping search that assigns protograph VNs to fading blocks so that all information VNs achieve full diversity, while including the minimum additional parity VNs when full diversity is infeasible at the nominal rate. Numerical results on the 5G New Radio LDPC codes show that the proposed search finds block mappings that guarantee full diversity for all information bits without modifying the base-graph structure, yielding a markedly steeper high-SNR slope and lower BLER than random mappings.</description>

      <title>Successive Cancellation List Decoding of Extended Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are an important class of non-binary error-correction codes. They are particularly competent in correcting burst errors, being widely applied in modern communications and data storage systems. This also thanks to their distance property of reaching the Singleton bound, being the maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. This paper proposes a new list decoding for extended RS (eRS) codes defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^n}. It is developed based on transforming an eRS code into n binary polar codes. Consequently, it can be decoded by the successive cancellation (SC) decoding and further their list decoding, i.e., the SCL decoding. A pre-transformed matrix is required for reinterpretating the eRS codes, which also determines their SC and SCL decoding performances. Its column linear independence property is studied, leading to theoretical characterization of their SC decoding performance. Our proposed decoding and analysis are validated numerically.</description>

      <title>Flexible FTN-OTFS for High-Mobility LEO Satellite-to-Ground Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a lightweight LEO satellite-assisted flexible faster-than-Nyquist (FTN)-orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) (LEO-FFTN-OTFS) scheme is proposed to address the stringent constraints on onboard power consumption and the severe impact of fast time-varying channels in non-terrestrial networks. A rigorous system framework incorporating realistic 3GPP Tapped Delay Line (TDL) channel models is established to accurately capture high-mobility propagation characteristics. To counteract channel aging effects while maintaining low computational complexity, an SNR-aware flexible FTN strategy is introduced, wherein a low-complexity Look-Up Table (LUT) is utilized to adaptively optimize the time-domain compression factor based on instantaneous channel responses. Through this mechanism, the trade-off between rate acceleration and interference penalty is effectively resolved, ensuring that spectral efficiency is maximized while strict reliability constraints are satisfied with minimal processing overhead. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided, in which analytical expressions for effective throughput, energy efficiency, and bit error rate are derived. Finally, it is demonstrated by extensive simulations that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms static FTN benchmarks, offering a superior balance of high throughput and robustness for next-generation LEO communications.</description>

      <title>Quantum $(r,\delta)$-Locally Recoverable BCH and Homothetic-BCH Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes ($(r,\delta)$-LRCs) are the quantum version of classical $(r,\delta)$-LRCs designed to recover multiple failures in large-scale distributed and cloud storage systems. A quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRC, $Q(C)$, can be constructed from an $(r,\delta)$-LRC, $C$, which is Euclidean or Hermitian dual-containing.
  This article is devoted to studying how to get quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs from BCH and homothetic-BCH codes. As a consequence, we give pure quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs which are optimal for the Singleton-like bound.</description>

      <title>Multi-target DoA estimation with a single Rydberg atomic receiver by spectral analysis of spatially-resolved fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg-based Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation has been hampered by the complexity of receiver arrays and the single-target, narrow-band limitations of existing single-receiver methods. This paper introduces a novel approach that addresses these limitations. We demonstrate that by spatially resolving the fluorescence profile along the vapor cell, the multi-target problem can be effectively solved. Our approach hinges on the insight that by superimposing incoming signals with a strong local oscillator (LO), the complex atomic absorption pattern is linearized into a simple superposition of sinusoids. In this new representation, each spatial frequency uniquely and directly maps to the DoA of a target. This reduces the multi-target challenge into a spectral estimation problem, which we address using Prony's method. Our approach, termed Imaging-based Spectral Estimation (ISE), inherently supports multi-target detection and restores the full broadband capability of the sensor by removing the restrictive cell-length dependency. This development also shows potential for realizing multi-channel Rydberg receivers and the continuous-aperture sensing required for holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). We develop a comprehensive theoretical model, derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) as a performance benchmark, and present simulations validating the effectiveness of the approach to resolve multiple targets.</description>

      <title>Status Updating via Integrated Sensing and Communication: Freshness Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies strategic design in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) architecture for status updating of remotely navigating agents. We consider an ISAC-enabled base station that can sense the state of a remote source and communicate this information back to the source. Both sensing and communication succeed with given probabilities and incur distinct costs. The objective is to optimise a long-term cost that captures information freshness, measured by the age of information (AoI), at the source together with sensing and communication overheads. The resulting sequential decision problem is formulated as a discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision process with a two-dimensional AoI state, representing information freshness at the source and at the base station. We prove that the optimal stationary policy admits a monotone threshold structure characterised by a nondecreasing switching curve in the AoI state space. Our numerical analysis illustrates the structures of the value function and the optimal decision map. These results demonstrate that freshness-based objectives can be naturally integrated into ISAC design, while yielding interpretable and implementable strategies.</description>

      <title>Feedback Control via Integrated Sensing and Communication: Uncertainty Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies strategic design in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) architecture for feedback control of cyber-physical systems. We focus on a setting in which the regulation of a physical process (i.e., remote source) is performed via an ISAC-enabled base station. The base station can alternate between tracking the state of the source and delivering control-relevant information back to the source. For a Gauss-Markov source subject to i.i.d. Bernoulli sensing and communication links, under a finite-horizon linear-quadratic-Gaussian cost, we rigorously characterise the optimal policies through an uncertainty-aware synthesis. We establish that the optimal switching policy, for the ISAC system at the base station, is threshold-based in terms of the source and base-station estimation covariances, while the optimal control policy, for the actuator at the source, is linear in the source state estimate. We show that the threshold region$\unicode{x2014}$defined as the set of estimation covariance pairs for which communication is preferred over sensing$\unicode{x2014}$expands with increasing source uncertainty and contracts with increasing base-station uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A complete characterisation of conditional entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropies are fundamental measures of uncertainty with central importance in information theory and statistics and applications across all the quantitative sciences. Under a natural set of operational axioms, the most general form of entropy is captured by the family of R\'enyi entropies, parameterized by a real number $\alpha$. Conditional entropy extends the notion of entropy by quantifying uncertainty from the viewpoint of an observer with access to potentially correlated side information. However, despite their significance and the emergence of various useful definitions, a complete characterization of measures of conditional entropy that satisfy a natural set of operational axioms has remained elusive. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of conditional entropy, defined through a set of axioms that are essential for any operationally meaningful definition: additivity for independent random variables, invariance under relabeling, and monotonicity under conditional mixing channels. We prove that the most general form of conditional entropy is captured by a family of measures that are exponential averages of R\'enyi entropies of the conditioned distribution and parameterized by a real parameter and a probability measure on the positive reals. Finally, we show that these quantities determine the rate of transformation under conditional mixing and provide a set of second laws of quantum thermodynamics with side information for states diagonal in the energy eigenbasis.</description>

      <title>Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication against Communication and Sensing Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing privacy and communication confidentiality play fundamentally different but interconnected roles in adversarial wireless environments. Capturing this interplay within a single physical-layer framework is particularly challenging in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the same waveform simultaneously serves dual purposes. We study a secure ISAC system in which a monostatic transmitter simultaneously sends a confidential message to a legitimate receiver and senses an environmental state, while a passive adversary attempts both message decoding and state estimation. We partially characterize the fundamental trade-offs among three performance measures: the transmitter's secrecy rate, its detection exponent, and the adversary's detection exponent. Beyond the joint input distribution that governs overall performance, the trade-offs are further shaped by the transmitter's ability to extract keys via feedback and hide both the content and structure of the codewords via wiretap and resolvability codes. We derive an achievable region, and illustrate the resulting design trade-offs through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Perfect Sequences and Hadamard Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite sequence of numbers is perfect if it has zero periodic autocorrelation after a nontrivial cyclic shift. In this work, we study quaternionic perfect sequences having a one-to-one correspondence with the binary sequences arising in Williamson's construction of quaternion-type Hadamard matrices. Using this correspondence, we devise an enumeration algorithm that is significantly faster than previously used algorithms and does not require the sequences to be symmetric. We implement our algorithm and use it to enumerate all circulant and possibly non-symmetric Williamson-type matrices of orders up to 21; previously, the largest order exhaustively enumerated was 13. We prove that when the blocks of a quaternion-type Hadamard matrix are circulant, the blocks are necessarily pairwise amicable. This dramatically improves the filtering power of our algorithm: in order 20, the number of block pairs needing consideration is reduced by a factor of over 25,000. We use our results to construct quaternionic Hadamard matrices of interest in quantum communication and prove they are not equivalent to those constructed by other means. We also study the properties of quaternionic Hadamard matrices analytically, and demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing quaternionic Hadamard matrices with a fixed pattern of entries. These results indicate a richer set of properties and suggest an abundance of quaternionic Hadamard matrices for sufficiently large orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important distinction in our understanding of capacities of classical versus quantum channels is marked by the following question: is there an algorithm which can compute (or even efficiently compute) the capacity? While there is overwhelming evidence suggesting that quantum channel capacities may be uncomputable, a formal proof of any such statement is elusive. We initiate the study of the hardness of computing quantum channel capacities. We show that, for a general quantum channel, it is QMA-hard to compute its quantum capacity, and that the maximal-entanglement-assisted zero-error one-shot classical capacity is uncomputable.</description>

      <title>Structural Conditions for Native CCZ Magic-State Fountains in qLDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes promise constant-rate, linear-distance families with bounded-weight checks, and recent work has realized transversal or constant-depth non-Clifford gates on various (often non-LDPC) codes. However, no explicit \emph{qubit} qLDPC family is known that simultaneously has constant rate, linear distance, bounded stabilizer weight, and a native \emph{magic-state fountain} that prepares many non-Clifford resource states in constant depth.
  We take a structural approach and identify coding-theoretic conditions under which a CSS qLDPC family necessarily supports a constant-depth $\CCZ$ magic-state fountain. The key ingredients are: (i) an algebraic notion of \emph{magic-friendly triples} of $X$-type logical operators, defined by pairwise orthogonality and a triple-overlap form controlling diagonal $\CCZ$ phases, and (ii) a 3-uniform hypergraph model of physical $\CCZ$ circuits combined with a packing lemma that turns large collections of such triples with bounded overlaps into bounded-degree hypergraphs.
  Our main theorem shows that if a CSS code family on $n$ qubits admits $\Omega(n^{1+\gamma})$ magic-friendly triples whose supports have bounded per-qubit participation, then there exists a constant-depth circuit of physical $\CCZ$ gates implementing $\Omega(n^{\gamma})$ logical $\CCZ$ gates in parallel while preserving distance up to a constant factor. For asymptotically good qLDPC families such as quantum Tanner codes, this reduces the existence of a native $\CCZ$ magic-state fountain to a concrete combinatorial problem about counting and distributing magic-friendly triples in the logical $X$ space.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Network for Node Regression on Random Geometric Graphs with Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph attention networks (GATs) are widely used and often appear robust to noise in node covariates and edges, yet rigorous statistical guarantees demonstrating a provable advantage of GATs over non-attention graph neural networks~(GNNs) are scarce. We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: responses are generated from latent node-level covariates, but only noise-perturbed versions of the latent covariates are observed; and the sample graph is a random geometric graph created from the node covariates but contaminated by independent Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi edges. We propose and analyze a carefully designed, task-specific GAT that constructs denoised proxy features for regression. We prove that regressing the response variables on the proxies achieves lower error asymptotically in (a) estimating the regression coefficient compared to the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator on the noisy node covariates, and (b) predicting the response for an unlabelled node compared to a vanilla graph convolutional network~(GCN) -- under mild growth conditions. Our analysis leverages high-dimensional geometric tail bounds and concentration for neighbourhood counts and sample covariances. We verify our theoretical findings through experiments on synthetically generated data. We also perform experiments on real-world graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in several node regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Enforced Quadratic Degradability Beyond Low Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16312v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate degradability provides a powerful framework for bounding the quantum and private capacities of noisy quantum channels in regimes where exact degradability fails. While generic low-noise channels exhibit a non-degradability parameter that decays as a fractional power of the noise strength, certain symmetric channels are known to display an enhanced quadratic suppression. In this work, we investigate the structural origin of this phenomenon through a family of high-dimensional, rotationally symmetric noise models constructed from angular momentum operators. We first establish that the pure noise component of these channels is maximally distinguishable from the identity channel in diamond norm, revealing a geometric orthogonality between signal and noise. Building on this structure, we construct an explicit symmetric degrading map and prove that the approximate degradability parameter scales quadratically with the noise parameter for all system dimensions. To clarify the mechanism behind this behavior, we identify algebraic conditions on the noise operators that guarantee the cancellation of leading-order non-degradability terms. These conditions apply not only to the rotationally symmetric model studied here, but also to a distinct family of high-dimensional depolarizing channels based on discrete unitary operator bases. Numerical evaluations of capacity lower bounds further illustrate the practical impact of the quadratic suppression. Together, these results demonstrate that enhanced approximate degradability arises from symmetry-induced orthogonality and invariance properties, rather than from low-dimensional or model-specific effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rank weight hierarchy of linear codes which are stable under a linear endomorphism defined over the base field, in particular when the endomorphism is cyclic. In this last case, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for such a code to have first rank weight equal to $1$ in terms of its generator polynomial, as well as an explicit formula for its last rank weight.</description>

      <title>Linear Complexity Computation of Code Distance and Minimum Size of Trapping Sets for LDPC Codes with Bounded Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that, given \(b\ge 0\), finding an $(a,b)$-trapping set with the minimum \(a\) in a binary linear code is NP-hard. In this paper, we demonstrate that this problem can be solved with linear complexity with respect to the code length for codes with bounded treewidth. Furthermore, suppose a tree decomposition corresponding to the treewidth of the binary linear code is known. In that case, we also provide a specific algorithm to compute the minimum \(a\) and the number of the corresponding \((a, b)\)-trapping sets for a given \(b\) with linear complexity. Simulation experiments are presented to verify the correctness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Age Optimal Sampling and Routing under Intermittent Links and Energy Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Links in practical systems, such as satellite--terrestrial integrated networks, exhibit distinct delay distributions, intermittent availability, and heterogeneous energy costs. These characteristics pose significant challenges to maintaining timely and energy-efficient status updates. While link availability restricts feasible transmission routes, routing decisions determine the actual delay and energy expenditure. This paper tackles these challenges by jointly optimizing sampling and routing decisions to minimize monotonic, non-linear Age of Information (AoI). The proposed formulation incorporates key system features, including multiple routes with correlated random delays, stochastic link availability, and route-dependent energy consumption. We model the problem as an infinite-horizon Constrained Semi-Markov Decision Process (CSMDP) with a hybrid state--action space and develop an efficient nested algorithm, termed Bisec-\textsc{ReaVI}, to solve this problem. We analyze the structural properties of the solution and reveal a well-defined jointly optimal policy structure: (i) For general monotonic penalty functions, the optimal sampling policy is a piecewise linear waiting policy with at most $N$ breakpoints given $N$ routes; and (ii) under a derived Expected Penalty Ordering condition, the optimal routing policy is a monotonic threshold-based handover policy characterized by at most $\binom{N}{2}$ thresholds. Numerical experiments in a \textit{satellite--terrestrial} integrated routing scenario demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently balances energy usage and information freshness, and reveal a counter-intuitive insight: \textit{even routes with higher average delay, higher delay variance or lower availability can still play a critical role in minimizing monotonic functions of AoI}.</description>

      <title>Function-Correcting Codes for Insertion-Deletion Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In coding theory, handling errors that occur when symbols are inserted or deleted from a transmitted message is a long-standing challenge. Optimising redundancy for insertion and deletion channels remains a key open problem with significant importance for applications in DNA data storage and document exchange. Recently, a coding framework known as function-correcting codes has been proposed to address the challenge of minimising redundancy while preserving specific functions of the message. This framework has gained attention due to its potential applications in machine learning systems and long-term archival data storage. Motivated by the problem of redundancy optimisation for insertion and deletion channels, we propose a new framework called function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In this paper, we introduce the notions of function-correcting insertion codes, function-correcting deletion codes, and function-correcting insdel codes, and we show that these three formulations are equivalent. We then define insdel distance matrices and irregular insdel-distance codes, and derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal redundancy achievable by function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In addition, we establish Gilbert-Varshamov and Plotkin-like bounds on the length of irregular insdel-distance codes. Using the relation between optimal redundancy and the length of such codes, we obtain a simplified lower bound on optimal redundancy. Finally, we derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of function-correcting insdel codes for several classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, VT syndrome functions, the number-of-runs function, and the maximum-run-length function.</description>

      <title>Robust and Secure Blockage-Aware Pinching Antenna-assisted Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a blockage-aware pinching antenna (PA) system designed for secure and robust wireless communication. The considered system comprises a base station equipped with multiple waveguides, each hosting multiple PAs, and serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To safeguard confidential transmissions, artificial noise (AN) is deliberately injected to degrade the eavesdropping channels. Recognizing that conventional linear CSI-error bounds become overly conservative for spatially distributed PA architectures, we develop new geometry-aware uncertainty sets that jointly characterize eavesdroppers position and array-orientation errors. Building upon these sets, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem that determines per-waveguide beamforming and AN covariance, individual PA power-ratio allocation, and PA positions to maximize the system sum rate subject to secrecy constraints. The highly non-convex design problem is efficiently addressed via a low computational complexity iterative algorithm that capitalizes on block coordinate descent, penalty-based methods, majorization-minimization, the S-procedure, and Lipschitz-based surrogate functions. Simulation results demonstrate that sum rates for the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed antenna systems by 4.7 dB, offering substantially improved rate and secrecy performance. In particular, (i) adaptive PA positioning preserves LoS to legitimate users while effectively exploiting waveguide geometry to disrupt eavesdropper channels, and (ii) neglecting blockage effects in the PA system significantly impacts the system design, leading to performance degradation and inadequate secrecy guarantees.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Decoding Failure Rate of Binary Regular Codes Using Iterative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing closed-form estimates of the decoding failure rate of iterative decoders for low- and moderate-density binary parity-check codes has attracted significant interest in the research community. Recently, interest in this topic has increased due to the use of iterative decoders in post-quantum cryptosystems, where the desired decoding failure rates (DFRs) are less than or equal to $2^{-128}$ and impossible to estimate via Monte Carlo simulations. We propose a new technique that provides accurate DFR estimates for a two-iteration (parallel) bit-flipping decoder that can be used for cryptographic purposes. We estimate the bit-flipping probabilities at the second decoder iteration and the syndrome weight distribution before and after the first iteration as a function of the code parameters and error weight. We validate our results numerically by comparing the modelled and simulated syndrome weights, the incorrectly guessed error bit distribution at the end of the first iteration, and the DFR after two iterations in both the floor and waterfall regimes. Finally, we apply our method to estimate the DFR of the LEDAcrypt cryptographic system, a post-quantum key encapsulation method that employs a two-iteration bit-flipping decoder. We show that the DFR estimate resulting from the chosen code parameters can be improved by a factor larger than $2^{70}$ with respect to previous estimation techniques, when $128$-bit security is required. This allows for a $20$% reduction in public key and ciphertext sizes at no security loss. We note that our results can be applied to the post-quantum cryptosystem known as Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE) replacing the current ``BIKE-flip decoder'' with the two-iteration decoder and consequently endowing BIKE with the property of indistinguishability under an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (IND-CCA$2$), provably.</description>

      <title>Fault Tolerant Quantum Simulation via Symplectic Transvections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computing realize logical circuits gate-by-gate, synthesizing each gate independently on one or more code blocks. This incurs excess overhead and doesn't leverage common structures in quantum algorithms. In contrast, we propose a framework that enables the execution of entire logical circuit blocks at once, preserving their global structure. This whole-block approach allows for the direct implementation of logical Trotter circuits - of arbitrary rotation angles - on any stabilizer code, providing a powerful new method for fault tolerant Hamiltonian simulation within a single code block. At the heart of our approach lies a deep structural correspondence between symplectic transvections and Trotter circuits. This connection enables both logical and physical circuits to share the Trotter structure while preserving stabilizer centralization and circuit symmetry even in the presence of non-Clifford rotations. We discuss potential approaches to fault tolerance via biased noise and code concatenation. While we illustrate the key principles using a $[[8,3,3]]$ code, our simulations show that the framework applies to Hamiltonian simulation on even good quantum LDPC codes. These results open the door to new algorithm-tailored, block-level strategies for fault tolerant circuit design, especially in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>On the Separability of Information in Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23937v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models transform noise into data by injecting information that was captured in their neural network during the training phase. In this paper, we ask: \textit{what} is this information? We find that, in pixel-space diffusion models, (1) a large fraction of the total information in the neural network is committed to reconstructing small-scale perceptual details of the image, and (2) the correlations between images and their class labels are informed by the semantic content of the images, and are largely agnostic to the low-level details. We argue that these properties are intrinsically tied to the manifold structure of the data itself. Finally, we show that these facts explain the efficacy of classifier-free guidance: the guidance vector amplifies the mutual information between images and conditioning signals early in the generative process, influencing semantic structure, but tapers out as perceptual details are filled in.</description>

      <title>Think Less, Label Better: Multi-Stage Domain-Grounded Synthetic Data Generation for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models in Telecommunications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However, generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting, where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever, base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Information Bottleneck Theory of Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a \textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts. Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU} activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding of adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>Generalized ovals, 2.5-dimensional additive codes, and multispreads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present constructions and bounds for additive codes over a finite field in terms of their geometric counterpart, i.e., projective systems. It is known that the maximum number of $(h-1)$-spaces in PG$(2,q)$, such that no hyperplane contains three, is given by $q^h+1$ if $q$ is odd. Those geometric objects are called generalized ovals. We show that cardinality $q^h+2$ is possible if we decrease the dimension a bit. We completely determine the minimum possible lengths of additive codes over GF$(9)$ of dimension $2.5$ and give improved constructions for other small parameters, including codes outperforming the best linear codes. As an application, we consider multispreads in PG$(4,q)$, in particular, completing the characterization of parameters of GF$(4)$-linear $64$-ary one-weight codes.

      <title>Generalizations of the Normalized Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform for Limited Data Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT) exploits one-dimensional Wasserstein transport and the Radon transform to represent prominent features in images. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. To make the R-CDT invariant under arbitrary affine transformations, a two-step normalization of the R-CDT has been proposed in our earlier works. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a family of generalized normalizations to enhance flexibility for applications. Second, we study multi-dimensional and non-Euclidean settings by making use of generalized Radon transforms. We prove that our novel feature representations are invariant under certain transformations and allow for linear separation in feature space. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments based on 2d images, 3d shapes and 3d rotation matrices, showing near perfect classification accuracies and clustering results.</description>
