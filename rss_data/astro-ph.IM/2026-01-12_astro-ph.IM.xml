      <title>GALFITools: A Python library to enhance GALFIT usage in galaxy image modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how galaxies form and evolve requires measuring their light distributions in images taken by telescopes. This process often involves fitting mathematical models to galaxy images to extract properties such as size, brightness, components, and shape. GALFIT is a widely used tool for this purpose, but it requires careful preparation of input files and interpretation of results, which can be a barrier to efficient use. GALFITools is a Python library that streamlines this workflow by automating many of the tasks surrounding the use of GALFIT. These include generating image masks, estimating sky background, modeling the telescope's point spread function (PSF), and extracting physical parameters from GALFIT outputs. The software is designed for researchers and students who work with galaxy image modeling and aims to make the process more reproducible, accessible, and scalable.</description>

      <title>The Nucleated Atomistic Grain Growth Simulator (NAGGS): application to the size-dependent structural and physical properties of nanosilicate dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the Nucleated Atomistic Grain Growth Simulator (NAGGS) as a new tool to model the growth of realistic nanosized dust grains through the progressive accretion of monomers onto a nucleated seed. NAGGS can be used with open source molecular dynamics codes, allowing for the modelling of grains that have different chemical compositions and are grown under a range of astrophysical conditions. To demonstrate how NAGGS works, we use it to produce 40 nanosilicate grain models with diameters of approx. 3.5 nm and consisting of approx. 1500 atoms. We consider Mg-rich olivinic and pyroxenic grains, and growth under two circumstellar dust-producing conditions. We calculate properties from the atomistically detailed nanograin structures (e.g. morphology, surface area, density, dipole moments) with respect to the size, chemical composition, and growth temperature of the grains. Our simulations reveal detailed new insights into the complex interacting degrees of freedom during grain growth and how they affect the resultant physicochemical properties. For example, we find that surface roughness depends on the Mg:Si ratio during growth.We also find that nanosilicates have very high dipole moments, which depend on the growth temperature. Such findings could have important consequences (e.g. astrochemistry, microwave emission). In summary, our bottom-up physically motivated approach offers a detailed understanding of nanograins that could help in both interpreting observations and improving dust models.</description>

      <title>A Large and Precise All-Sky Photometric Standard Star Dataset Across More Than 200 Passbands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision photometric standard stars play a key role in enabling accurate photometric calibration and advancing various fields of astronomy. However, due to limitations in calibration methods and the limited availability and underuse of high-precision reference data, existing photometric standard stars may suffer from insufficient numbers, systematic errors exceeding 10 milli-magnitude (mmag), limited photometric band coverage, or incomplete sky coverage, among other issues. To overcome these limitations, we have constructed the largest (over 200 million stars, 1000 times the widely recognized Landolt standards in the same magnitude range), most precise (better than 10 mmag), and most comprehensive (over 200 bands, nearly 40 times the coverage of traditional standards) all-sky standard stars. Based on standards, we have calibrated multiple survey datasets to mmag precision, and subsequently developed a complete sky distribution of stars for the Pan-STARRS system. This database, the BEst STars Database (BEST), is expected to pave the way for achieving mmag-level - or even higher - photometric precision in large-scale surveys, and to play a central role in shaping a high-precision astronomical measurement framework.</description>

      <title>Data post-processing gain resulting from the patchy nature of speckles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data post-processing gain is an important parameter for exposure time calculations used to inform the design of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Assuming azimuthally symmetric noise properties is a common simplifying assumption for such simulations, which neglects the patchy nature of the residual diffracted starlight; i.e., speckles. Fortunately, patchiness might prove to be an opportunity that improves the overall sensitivity of observatory assuming photon-noise limited speckle subtraction. We illustrate this effect in the context of angular differential imaging (ADI), which is one of the possible observing strategies being considered for the detection and characterization of exo-Earth with HWO. We show that combining observations of two observatory roll angles leads to a gain in signal-to-noise greater than $\sqrt{2}$ when the patchy starlight dominates other noise sources. The gain can be closer to x2 when the starlight dominates the noise budget by more than an order of magnitude. In other words, combining good and bad observations is better than combining two average ones. This statement is very general as it is a direct consequence of combining data with a weighted mean. It applies more broadly to any combination of observations with varying noise level.</description>

      <title>Featureless stars: Flux Calibration for Extremely Large Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectrophotometric flux calibration of recent spectroscopic surveys has reached a limiting systematic precision of approximately 1-3 percent, and is often biased near the wavelengths associated with H I Balmer absorption. As we prepare for the next generation of imaging and spectroscopic surveys, and high-precision cosmology experiments, we must find a way to address this systematic. Towards this goal, we have identified a global network of 29 bright (G &lt; 17.5) featureless white dwarf stars that have a spectral energy distribution consistent with an almost pure blackbody form over the entire optical and near-infrared wavelength range. Based on this sample, we have computed the systematic uncertainty and AB magnitude offsets associated with Gaia, SDSS, SMSS, PanSTARRS, DES, and 2MASS, and we have also checked the consistency of our objects with both GALEX and WISE. The magnitude range of the featureless stars reported here are ideally suited to observations taken with the forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes, as well as calibrating the survey data acquired by the Rubin, Euclid and Roman observatories. Finally, all of the high-precision spectrophotometric standard stars reported here have been included in the latest release of the PypeIt data reduction pipeline.</description>

      <title>Paving the Road to the Habitable Worlds Observatory with High-Resolution Imaging I: New and Archival Speckle Observations of Potential HWO Target Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image about 25 potentially habitable exoplanets and determine their properties. This challenge will require a large survey of nearby, bright stars -- ~100 according to the Astro2020 Decadel Survey. To ensure the success of the mission and to help guide design decisions, the stellar multiplicity of the target stars must be well-understood. To this end, we present optical speckle imaging of stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) provisional HWO star list, which is currently the Tier 1 target list for the HWO Target Stars and Systems Sub-Working Group. We obtained new observations using `Alopeke and Zorro at Gemini Observatory and queried the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive for archival observations, resulting in speckle imaging data for 80 of the 164 stars. We confirmed one candidate companion detected previously by Gaia (HD 90089) and obtained an ambiguous detection of a known companion (HD 212330). To examine our sensitivity to companions, we simulated stellar companions down to ~0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for each target and found that 75%-85% would be detected in our speckle images; the remaining simulated companions are either too faint or too close-in, and will require follow-up using other methods such as long-term spectroscopic measurements and space-based techniques. This work represents a first step towards surveying potential HWO targets for close-in stellar companions and helping to inform the target selection process for the HWO direct-imaging survey, bringing us closer towards the discovery of potential habitable worlds.</description>

      <title>Robust Bilinear-Noise-Optimal Control for Gravitational-Wave Detectors: A Mixed LQG/$H_\infty$ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At its lowest frequencies, LIGO is limited by noise in its many degrees of freedom of suspended optics, which, in turn, introduce noise in the interferometer through their feedback control systems. Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and small-field astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric observations can, in principle, be used to detect gravitational waves. In this paper we give a practical overview of the gravitational wave effects which can be expected specifically in small-field astrometric data. Particular emphasis is placed on the differential effect between pairs of sources within a finite field of view. We also present several general findings that are not restricted to the small-field case. A detailed theoretical derivation of the general astrometric effect of a plane gravitational wave is provided. Numerical simulations, which underline our theoretical findings, are presented.
  We find that small-field missions suffer from significant detrimental properties, largely because their relatively small fields only allow the measurement of small differential effects which can be expected to be almost totally absorbed by standard plate calibrations.</description>

      <title>Probing the morphology of the Gum Nebula through pulsar observables and a novel distance estimation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various existing models of the Gum Nebula differ significantly in their parameters and suggested origins, which can be independently tested for consistency with data on some key observables of pulsars in the direction of the nebula. Our analysis of such data on the Vela pulsar, assuming a dominant scattering region in its foreground, suggests that the fractional distance of the scatterer is $0.89 \pm 0.01$, and for the given distance of the Vela pulsar, it translates to $254 \pm 16$ pc. Using independent distances of ten pulsars, we suggest a refined description of the Gum Nebula electron density model with its basic morphology similar to that used in the YMW16 model, which now provides better estimates of pulsar distances in these directions. In our new Gum Nebula model, as expected, the Vela pulsar would be behind the frontal edge of the Gum shell, which was intriguingly located in front of the nebula in the YMW16 model. We also present a new technique to better constrain the pulsar distances using their dispersion measure and temporal broadening simultaneously, and find that it is less affected by the uncertainties in the Galactic electron density distribution models. Notably, the new approach shows that the expected temporal broadening as a function of trial distance does not follow a monotonic increasing trend, but instead exhibits oscillations at regions of enhanced electron density. This behaviour is expected, as the method employs the integral form of temporal broadening with the appropriate weighting kernel, leading to more reliable estimates.</description>

      <title>An Improved UV-Optical Diagnostic for Rejuvenating Galaxies in the Local Universe and Implications for Galaxy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rejuvenating galaxies are important probes of galaxy evolution, yet identifying them observationally is challenging as constraining recent star formation histories requires both photometric and spectroscopic data. We present a method for identifying rejuvenating galaxies in the local Universe using ultraviolet (UV) imaging and optical spectroscopy, building on a recent selection that identifies a system as rejuvenating if it is quenched in the near-UV (NUV; tracing $\sim\!100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales) but star-forming in H$\alpha$ (tracing $\sim\!10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales). Shortly after a star formation episode, however, the NUV is dominated by the same massive stars that power H$\alpha$, so these indicators do not always trace distinct timescales. To address this, we derive a relation that predicts the NUV emission associated with the ionizing O-star population traced by H$\alpha$, enabling us to isolate the NUV contribution from longer-lived stars (primarily B/A stars with $M\lesssim\!20\,M_\odot$). Subtracting the predicted O-star NUV from the dust-corrected NUV yields a more reliable rejuvenation diagnostic. Using this method, we identify $\sim\!10^{4}$ rejuvenating galaxies in a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies ($\sim\!4.5\%$). These galaxies have intermediate stellar masses and are found primarily in lower-density environments, becoming increasingly rare toward the centers of groups and clusters. Rejuvenating galaxies also exhibit systematically lower gas-phase metallicities, consistent with fueling by the accretion of metal-poor gas.</description>

      <title>Improved parametrized test of general relativity using the IMRPhenomX waveform family: Including higher harmonics and precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When testing general relativity (GR) with gravitational wave observations, parametrized tests of deviations from the expected strong-field source dynamics are one of the most widely used techniques. We present an updated version of the parametrized framework with the state-of-art IMRPhenomX waveform family. Our new framework incorporates deviations in the dominant mode as well as in the higher-order modes of the waveform. We demonstrate that the missing physics of either higher-order modes or precession in the parametrized model can lead to a biased conclusion of false deviation from GR. Our new implementation mitigates this issue and enables us to perform the tests for highly asymmetric and precessing binaries without being subject to systematic biases due to missing physics. Finally, we apply the improved test to analyze events observed during the second half of the third observing run of LIGO and Virgo (O3b). We provide constraints on GR deviations by combining O3b results with those from previous observation runs. Our findings show no evidence for violations of GR.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Online Emulation for Accelerating Complex Physical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex physical simulations often require trade-offs between model fidelity and computational feasibility. We introduce Adaptive Online Emulation (AOE), which dynamically learns neural network surrogates during simulation execution to accelerate expensive components. Unlike existing methods requiring extensive offline training, AOE uses Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELMs) to continuously adapt emulators along the actual simulation trajectory. We employ a numerically stable variant of the OS-ELM using cumulative sufficient statistics to avoid matrix inversion instabilities. AOE integrates with time-stepping frameworks through a three-phase strategy balancing data collection, updates, and surrogate usage, while requiring orders of magnitude less training data than conventional surrogate approaches. Demonstrated on a 1D atmospheric model of exoplanet GJ1214b, AOE achieves 11.1 times speedup (91% time reduction) across 200,000 timesteps while maintaining accuracy, potentially making previously intractable high-fidelity time-stepping simulations computationally feasible.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target Wh\,day$^{-1}$ and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2\,m-class phased array at 1064\,nm the reference geometry yields $\sim$0.6--0.8\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ to a 1\,m$^2$ receiver (about 28\,W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^{2}$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10\,m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$\,kW delivers $\sim$30--50\,kWh\,day$^{-1}$ at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an attitude estimation and yaw-rate control framework for balloon-borne payloads using pivot-only actuation, motivated by the Taurus experiment. Taurus is a long-duration balloon instrument designed for rapid azimuthal scanning at approximately 30 deg/s using a motorized pivot at the flight-train connection, without a reaction wheel. We model the gondola as a rigid body subject to realistic disturbances and sensing limitations, and implement a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) that estimates attitude and gyroscope bias by fusing inertial and vector-camera measurements. A simple PI controller uses the estimated states to regulate yaw rate. Numerical simulations incorporating representative disturbance and measurement noise levels are used to evaluate closed-loop control performance and MEKF behavior under flight-like conditions. Experimental tests on the Taurus gondola validate the pivot-only approach, demonstrating stable high-rate tracking under realistic hardware constraints. The close agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the simplified rigid-body model captures the dominant dynamics relevant for controller design and integrated estimation-and-control development.</description>
