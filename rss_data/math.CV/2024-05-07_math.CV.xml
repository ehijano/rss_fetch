      <title>Tower multitype and global regularity of the $\bar\partial$-Neumann operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach is given to property $(P_q)$ defined by Catlin for $q=1$ in a global and by Sibony in a local context, subsequently extended by Fu-Straube for $q&gt;1$. This property is known to imply compactness and global regularity in the $\bar\partial$-Neumann problem by a result of Kohn-Nirenberg, as well as condition $R$ by a result of Bell-Ligocka. In particular, we provide a self-contained proof of property $(P_q)$ for pseudoconvex hypersurfaces of finite D'Angelo $q$-type, the case originally studied by Catlin. Moreover, our proof covers more general classes of hypersurfaces inspired by a recent work of Huang-Yin. Proofs are broken down into isolated steps, some of which do not require pseudoconvexity.
  Our tools include: a new multitype invariant based on distinguished nested sequences of $(1,0)$ subbundles, defined in terms of derivatives of the Levi form; real and complex formal orbits; $k$-jets of functions relative to pairs of formal submanifolds; relative contact orders generalizing the usual contact orders; a new notion of supertangent vector fields having higher than expected relative contact orders; and a formal variant of a result by Diederich-Forn\ae ss arising as a key step in their proof of Kohn's ideal termination in the real-analytic case.</description>

      <title>Non-cyclicity and polynomials in Dirichlet-type spaces of the unit ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a description of the intersection of the zero set with the unit sphere of a zero-free polynomial in the unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^n$. This description leads to the formulation of a conjecture regarding the characterization of polynomials that are cyclic in Dirichlet-type spaces in the unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^n$. Furthermore, we answer partially ascertaining whether an arbitrary polynomial is not cyclic.</description>

      <title>Domains of existence of slice regular functions in one quaternionic variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we introduced domains of slice regularity in the space $\mathbb{H}$ of quaternions and also proved that domains of slice regularity satisfy a symmetry with respect to paths, called $2$-path-symmetry. In this paper, we give a full characterization by showing that all $2$-path-symmetric slice-open sets are domains of slice regularity. In fact, we will prove a counterpart of the Cartan-Thullen theorem for slice regular functions, namely that a slice-open set is a domain of existence for some slice regular function if and only if it is a domain of slice regularity, if and only if it is slice-regularly convex, if and only if it is $2$-path-symmetric. As a tool, we also prove an interpolation theorem of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem for random currents of integration along the zero divisors of standard Gaussian holomorphic sections in a sequence of holomorphic line bundles with Hermitian metrics of class $\mathscr{C}^{3}$ over a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. In the course of our analysis, we derive first-order asymptotics and upper decay estimates for near and off-diagonal Bergman kernels, respectively. These results are essential for determining the statistical properties of the zeros of random holomorphic sections.</description>

      <title>Inner Functions and Laminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study orbit counting problems for inner functions using geodesic and horocyclic flows on Riemann surface laminations. For a one component inner function of finite Lyapunov exponent with $F(0) = 0$, other than $z \to z^d$, we show that the number of pre-images of a point $z \in \mathbb{D} \setminus \{ 0\}$ that lie in a ball of hyperbolic radius $R$ centered at the origin satisfies $$ \mathcal{N}(z, R) \, \sim \, \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{1}{|z|} \cdot \frac{1}{\int_{\partial \mathbb{D}} \log |F'| dm}, \quad \text{as }R \to \infty. $$ For a general inner function of finite Lyapunov exponent, we show that the above formula holds up to a Ces\`aro average. Our main insight is that iteration along almost every inverse orbit is asymptotically linear. We also prove analogues of these results for parabolic inner functions of infinite height.</description>

      <title>Solutions to ${\rm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system with cone singularities via toric curves on compact Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a compact Riemann surface (X) with finite punctures (P_1, \ldots, P_k), we define toric curves as multi-valued, totally unramified holomorphic maps to (\mathbb{P}^n) with monodromy in a maximal torus of ({\rm PSU}(n+1)). \textit{Toric solutions} for the ({\rm SU}(n+1)) system on $X\setminus\{P_1,\ldots, P_k\}$ are recognized by their associated {\it toric} curves in (\mathbb{P}^n). We introduce a character n-ensemble as an (n)-tuple of meromorphic one-forms with simple poles and purely imaginary periods, generating toric curves on (X) minus finitely many points. We establish on $X$ a correspondence between character $n$-ensembles and toric solutions to the ({\rm SU}(n+1)) system with finitely many cone singularities. Our approach not only broadens seminal solutions for up to two cone singularities on the Riemann sphere, as classified by Jost-Wang (Int. Math. Res. Not., (6):277-290, 2002) and Lin-Wei-Ye (Invent. Math., 190(1):169-207, 2012), but also advances beyond the limits of Lin-Yang-Zhong's existence theorems (J. Differential Geom., 114(2):337-391, 2020) by introducing a new solution class.</description>

      <title>The spectral genus of an isolated hypersurface singularity and a conjecture relating to the Milnor number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of spectral genus $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ of a deformation of a germ of an isolated hypersurface singularity $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1}, 0) \to (\mathbb{C}, 0)$, defined as a sum of small exponents of monodromy eigenvalues. The number of these is equal to the geometric genus $p_{g}$, and hence $\widetilde{p}_g$ can be considered as a secondary invariant to it. We then explore a secondary version of the Durfee conjecture on $p_{g}$, regarding the relationship between $\widetilde{p}_{g}$ the Milnor number $\mu$, to the effect that $$\frac{\mu}{(n+2)!} &gt; \widetilde{p}_g.$$ We provide evidence by confirming the conjecture in several cases, including homogeneous singularities and singularities with large Newton polyhedra, and quasi-homogeneous or irreducible curve singularities.
  Our conjecture is shown to relate closely to the asymptotic behavior of the holomorphic analytic torsion of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on a degeneration of projective varieties, potentially indicating deeper geometric and analytic connections.</description>

      <title>Almost periodicity and boundary values of Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ almost periodicity to establish analogues of the Hardy--Stein identity and the Littlewood--Paley formula for Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series. A construction of Saksman and Seip shows that the limits in this Littlewood--Paley formula cannot be interchanged. We apply this construction to show that the limits in the definition of the mean counting function for Dirichlet series cannot be interchanged. These are essentially statements about the two different kinds of boundary values that we associate with Dirichlet series that converge to a bounded analytic function in a half-plane. The treatment of the mean counting function also involves an investigation of the zero sets and Blaschke products of such Dirichlet series.</description>

      <title>On the uniform convergence of continuous semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a region in the complex plane $\mathbb C$ and let $\{\Phi_t \}_{t\ge 0}$ be a continuous semigroup of functions on $\Omega$; that is, $\Phi_t:\Omega\to\Omega$ is holomorphic for every $t\ge 0$, $\Phi_0(z)=z$, for every $z\in\Omega$, $\Phi_t\circ\Phi_s=\Phi_{s+t}$, for every $s$, $t\ge 0$, and \[ \Phi_t(z)\to z\,,\quad t\to0^+, \] uniformly on compact subsets of $\Omega$. Despite this definition only requires the uniform convergence on compact subsets, P. Gumenyuk proved in 2014 that, when $\Omega$ is the unit disc, the convergence is uniform on the whole $\mathbb D$. In this paper, we enhance Gumenyuk's result by proving that for every continuous semigroup $\{\Phi_t\}_{t\ge 0}$ on $\mathbb D$ we have $$ \sup_{z\in\mathbb D}|\Phi_t(z)-z|= O(\sqrt t), \ t\to0^+. $$ In addition, we provide an example showing that $O(\sqrt t)$ is the best possible rate of uniform convergence valid for all semigroups on $\mathbb D$.
  When $\Omega$ is the right half-plane $\mathbb C_+$, we consider semigroups $\{\Phi_t\}$ with $\infty$ as its Denjoy-Wolff point. It is not difficult to show that Gumenyuk's result is no longer true for these semigroups. Our second result characterises when such continuous semigroups converge uniformly to the identity, as $t\to0^+$, in terms of their infinitesimal generators. Namely, this convergence holds if and only if the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup is bounded in the half-plane $\{z\in \mathbb C:\, \Re z&gt;1\}$. In this case, we can also prove that the rate of convergence is again $O(\sqrt{t})$, as $t\to0^+$.
  An example of application of this result is when the semigroup is in the Gordon-Hedenmalm class (the one producing bounded composition operators on Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series).
  An important ingredient in the proofs of these results is harmonic measure, which we have done through a classic result of M. Lavrentiev.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ and $g$ be analytic functions on the open unit disc $\mathbb D$ such that $|f|=|g|$ on a set $A$. We give an alternative proof of the result of Perez that there exists $c$ in the unit circle $\mathbb T$ such that $f=cg$ when $A$ is the union of two lines in $\mathbb D$ intersecting at an angle that is an irrational multiple of $\pi$, and from this deduce a sequential generalization of the result. Similarly, the same conclusion is valid when $f$ and $g$ are in the Nevanlinna class and $A$ is the union of the unit circle and an interior circle, tangential or not. We also provide sequential versions of this result and analyse the case $A=r\mathbb T$. Finally, we examine the most general situation when there is equality on two distinct circles in the disc, providing a result or counterexample for each possible configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that there exists a nontrivial uniform algebra that is Dirichlet on its maximal ideal space and has a dense set of elements that are exponentials. This answers a 64-year-old question of John Wermer and a 16-year-old question of Garth Dales and Joel Feinstein. Our example is P(X) for a certain compact set X in complex Euclidean 2-space ($\mathbb{C}^2$). It is also shown that there exists a logmodular uniform algebra with proper Shilov boundary but with no nontrivial Gleason parts. This answers a modified form of another 64-year-old question of Wermer.</description>

      <title>Reverse H\"older inequalities on the space of K\"ahler metrics of a Fano variety and effective openness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reverse H\"older inequality is established on the space of K\"ahler metrics in the first Chern class of a Fano manifold X endowed with Darvas L^{p}-Finsler metrics. The inequality holds under a uniform bound on a twisted Ricci potential and extends to Fano varieties with log terminal singularities. Its proof leverages a "hidden" log-concavity. An application to destabilizing geodesic rays is provided, which yields a reverse H\"older inequality for the speed of the geodesic. In the case of Aubin's continuity path on a K-unstable Fano variety, the constant in the corresponding H\"older bound is shown to only depend on p and the dimension of X. This leads to some intruiging relations to Harnack bounds and the partial C^{0}-estimate. In another direction, universal effective openness results are established for the complex singularity exponents (log canonical thresholds) of \omega-plurisubharmonic functions on any Fano variety. Finally, another application to K-unstable Fano varieties is given, involving Archimedean Igusa zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Periodic and quasi-motivic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth algebraic variety $X$. This is a family $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)$ of flat connections on a trivial vector bundle on $X$ depending linearly on parameters $s_1,...,s_n$ and generically invariant, up to isomorphism, under the shifts $s_i\mapsto s_i+1$ for all $i$. If in addition $\nabla$ has regular singularities, we call it a quasi-motivic pencil. We use tools from complex analysis to establish various remarkable properties of such pencils over $\mathbb C$. For example, we show that the monodromy of a quasi-motivic pencil is defined over the field of algebraic functions in $e^{2\pi is_j}$, and that its singularities are constrained to an arrangement of hyperplanes with integer normal vectors. Then we show that many important examples of families of flat connections, such as Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov, Dunkl, and Casimir connections, are quasi-motivic and thus periodic pencils.
  Besides being interesting in its own right, the periodic property of a pencil of flat connections turns out to be very useful in computing the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature of its reduction to positive characteristic. This will be done in our forthcoming paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $X$ is a compact complex analytic variety, which has quotient singularities in codimension 2, then there is a projective bimeromorphic morphism $f\colon Y\to X$, such that $Y$ has quotient singularities, and that the indeterminacy locus of $f^{-1}$ has codimension at least 3 in $X$. As an application, we deduce the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality on orbifold Chern classes for stable reflexive coherent sheaves on compact K\"ahler varieties which have quotient singularities in codimension 2.</description>
