      <title>Static Three-Dimensional Structures Determine Fast Dynamics Between Distal Loci Pairs in Interphase Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Live cell imaging experiments have shown that, although eukaryotic chromosome is compact, the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unusually rapid and cannot be explained by standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and the relaxation times is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. To resolve the puzzle, we developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by first calculating the precise three-dimensional (3D) structure using static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. The calculated 3D coordinates are used to accurately forecast the two-point dynamics reported in recent experiments that simultaneously monitor chromatin dynamics and transcription. Strikingly, the theory not only predicts the observed fast enhancer-promoter dynamics but also reveals a novel subdiffusive scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, in near quantitative agreement with recent experiments but diverging sharply from the expectations based on fractal globule models that are good descriptors of global organization of chromosomes. As a by product, we predict that cohesin depletion speeds up the dynamics between distal loci. Our framework shows that chromatin dynamics can be predicted based solely on static experimental data, reinforcing the concept that the three-dimensional structure determines their dynamic behavior. The generality of the theory opens new avenues for exploring chromatin dynamics, especially transcriptional dynamics, across diverse species.</description>

      <title>Computational Protein Science in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the significance of proteins, computational protein science has always been a critical scientific field, dedicated to revealing knowledge and developing applications within the protein sequence-structure-function paradigm. In the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant impacts in computational protein science, leading to notable successes in specific protein modeling tasks. However, those previous AI models still meet limitations, such as the difficulty in comprehending the semantics of protein sequences, and the inability to generalize across a wide range of protein modeling tasks. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a milestone in AI due to their unprecedented language processing &amp; generalization capability. They can promote comprehensive progress in fields rather than solving individual tasks. As a result, researchers have actively introduced LLM techniques in computational protein science, developing protein Language Models (pLMs) that skillfully grasp the foundational knowledge of proteins and can be effectively generalized to solve a diversity of sequence-structure-function reasoning problems. While witnessing prosperous developments, it's necessary to present a systematic overview of computational protein science empowered by LLM techniques. First, we summarize existing pLMs into categories based on their mastered protein knowledge, i.e., underlying sequence patterns, explicit structural and functional information, and external scientific languages. Second, we introduce the utilization and adaptation of pLMs, highlighting their remarkable achievements in promoting protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and protein design studies. Then, we describe the practical application of pLMs in antibody design, enzyme design, and drug discovery. Finally, we specifically discuss the promising future directions in this fast-growing field.</description>
