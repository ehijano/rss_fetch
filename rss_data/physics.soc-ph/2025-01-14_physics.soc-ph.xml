      <title>Prosecution of complex criminal networks: a multilevel ERGMs approach to CICIG's judicial cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prosecutors are essential in combating organized crime, making key decisions about prosecution, target selection, and structuring imputation strategies. Despite their importance, the configuration of these strategies remains empirically underexplored. This study analyzes cases investigated by the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) using a multilevel network approach to examine legal interventions targeting criminal networks. The research employs a multilevel Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM), integrating three networks: the criminal network of actors involved in illegal activities, the legal framework network represents offenses, and the prosecution network connects actors to offenses. This approach identifies structural patterns in prosecutorial strategies for individual actors and co-offenders. Findings show a strong tendency for triangular configurations, where two co-offenders are linked to a shared offense. Additionally, individuals are more likely to be involved in diverse offenses, spanning corruption-related and non-corruption-related activities, than in similar types of offenses. This highlights a strategic focus on addressing varied criminal behaviors within interconnected networks. Notably, by capturing the interplay between legal framework, criminal network, and prosecution strategy, the findings of this study emphasize the value of multilevel network analysis for enhancing the effectiveness of legal interventions, underscore the critical role of prosecutors in dismantling complex criminal networks, and offers a novel framework for improving prosecution strategies in combating organized crime.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game dynamics for higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative behaviors are deeply embedded in structured biological and social systems. Networks are often employed to portray pairwise interactions among individuals, where network nodes represent individuals and links indicate who interacts with whom. However, it is increasingly recognized that many empirical interactions often involve triple or more individuals instead of the massively oversimplified lower-order pairwise interactions, highlighting the fundamental gap in understanding the evolution of collective cooperation for higher-order interactions with diverse scales of the number of individuals. Here, we develop a theoretical framework of evolutionary game dynamics for systematically analyzing how cooperation evolves and fixates under higher-order interactions. Specifically, we offer a simple condition under which cooperation is favored under arbitrary combinations of different orders of interactions. Compared to pairwise interactions, our findings suggest that higher-order interactions enable lower thresholds for the emergence of cooperation. Surprisingly, we show that higher-order interactions favor the evolution of cooperation in large-scale systems, which is the opposite for lower-order scenarios. Our results offer a new avenue for understanding the evolution of collective cooperation in empirical systems with higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Driving towards net-zero: The impact of electric vehicle flexibility participation on a future Norwegian electricity system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle batteries have a proven flexibility potential which could serve as an alternative to conventional electricity storage solutions. EV batteries could support the balancing of supply and demand and the integration of variable renewable energy into the electricity system. The flexibility potential from electric vehicles, in distinction to conventional battery storage, depends on the vehicle user's willingness and opportunity to make their vehicle available for flexibility. This rate of participation is often not considered in studies, despite the impact electric vehicle flexibility could have on the electricity system. This work presents a modelling study of the Norwegian electricity system, demonstrating how a future net-zero electricity system can benefit from electric vehicles in terms of integrating renewables and balancing supply and demand, while considering the rate of participation. Our findings show electric vehicles' potential to eliminate the need for stationary battery storage with just 50% participation in vehicle-to-grid. We find that the flexibility of electric vehicles contributes to relative reductions in the total cost of the electricity system by almost 4% and 15% assuming 100% participation in flexible charging and vehicle-to-grid, respectively.</description>

      <title>Market Integration Pathways for Enhanced Geothermal Systems in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) can provide constant, reliable electricity and heat with minimal emissions, but high drilling costs and uncertain cost reductions leave their future unclear. We explore scenarios for the future adoption of EGS in a carbon-neutral, multi-sector European energy system. We find that in a net-zero system, heat (co-)generating EGS at current cost can support 20--30 GWth of capacity in Europe, primarily driven by district heating demands. When drilling costs decrease by approximately 60%, EGS becomes competitive in electricity markets, expanding its market opportunity by one order of magnitude. However, the spatially dispersed rollout of district heating contrasts with the confined overlap of high geological potential and low potential for other renewables, which conditions the competitiveness of electricity-generating EGS. This results in a challenge where the majority of EGS market potential depends on pan-European technology learning for cost reductions, emphasising coordination is crucial in stakeholders' efforts to reduce EGS cost.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Explosions for Large Scale Carbon Sequestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confronting the escalating threat of climate change requires innovative and large-scale interventions. This paper presents a bold proposal to employ a buried nuclear explosion in a remote basaltic seabed for pulverizing basalt, thereby accelerating carbon sequestration through Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW). By precisely locating the explosion beneath the seabed, we aim to confine debris, radiation, and energy while ensuring rapid rock weathering at a scale substantial enough to make a meaningful dent in atmospheric carbon levels. Our analysis outlines the parameters essential for efficient carbon capture and minimal collateral effects, emphasizing that a yield on the order of gigatons is critical for global climate impact. Although this approach may appear radical, we illustrate its feasibility by examining safety factors, preservation of local ecosystems, political considerations, and financial viability. This work argues for reimagining nuclear technology not merely as a destructive force but as a potential catalyst for decarbonization, thereby inviting further exploration of pioneering solutions in the fight against climate change.</description>

      <title>Combined effect of incentives and coupling in multigames in two-layer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of cooperation can easily result in inequality among members of a society, which provides an increasing gap between individual incomes. To tackle this issue, we introduce an incentive mechanism based on individual strategies and incomes, wherein a portion of the income from defectors is allocated to reward low-income cooperators, aiming to enhance cooperation by improving the equitable distribution of wealth across the entire population. Moreover, previous research has typically employed network structures or game mechanisms characterized by homogeneity. In this study, we present a network framework that more accurately reflects real-world conditions, where agents are engaged in multiple games, including prisoner's dilemma games in the top-layer and public good games in the down-layer networks. Within this framework, we introduce the concept of ``external coupling'' which connects agents across different networks as acquaintances, thereby facilitating access to shared datasets. Our results indicate that the combined positive effects of external coupling and incentive mechanism lead to optimal cooperation rates and lower Gini coefficients, demonstrating a negative correlation between cooperation and inequality. From a micro-level perspective, this phenomenon primarily arises from the regular network, whereas suboptimal outcomes are observed within the scale-free network. These observations help to give a deeper insight into the interplay between cooperation and wealth disparity in evolutionary games in large populations.</description>

      <title>Self-organized institutions in evolutionary dynamical-systems game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social institutions are systems of shared norms and rules that regulate people's behaviors, often emerging without external enforcement. They provide criteria to distinguish cooperation from defection and establish rules to sustain cooperation, shaped through long-term trial and error. While principles for successful institutions have been proposed, the mechanisms underlying their emergence remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the evolutionary dynamical-systems game, a framework that couples game actions with environmental dynamics and explores the evolution of cognitive frameworks for decision-making. We analyze a minimal model of common-pool resource management, where resources grow naturally and are harvested. Players use decision-making functions to determine whether to harvest at each step, based on environmental and peer monitoring. As these functions evolve, players detect selfish harvesting and punish it by degrading the environment through harvesting. This process leads to the self-organization of norms that classify harvesting actions as cooperative, defective, or punitive. The emergent norms for ``cooperativeness'' and rules of punishment serve as institutions. The environmental and players' states converge to distinct modes characterized by limit-cycles, representing temporal regularities in socio-ecological systems. These modes remain stable despite slight variations in decision-making, illustrating the stability of institutions. The evolutionary robustness of decision-making functions serves as a measure of the evolutionary favorability of institutions, highlighting the role of plasticity in responding to diverse opponents. This work introduces foundational concepts in evolutionary dynamical-systems games and elucidates the mechanisms underlying the self-organization of institutions by modeling the interplay between ecological dynamics and human decision-making.</description>

      <title>Hyperedge Overlap drives Synchronizability of Systems with Higher-Order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic organization of dynamical systems coupled via higher-order interactions plays a pivotal role in understanding their collective behavior. In this paper, we introduce a framework for systematically investigating the impact of the interaction structure on dynamical processes. Specifically, we develop an hyperedge overlap matrix whose elements characterize the two main aspects of the microscopic organization of higher-order interactions: the inter-order hyperedge overlap (non-diagonal matrix elements) and the intra-order hyperedge overlap (encapsulated in the diagonal elements). This way, the first set of terms quantifies the extent of superposition of nodes among hyperedges of different orders, while the second focuses on the number of nodes in common between hyperedges of the same order. Our findings indicate that large values of both types of hyperedge overlap hinder synchronization stability, and that the larger is the order of interactions involved, the more important is their role. Our findings also indicate that the two types of overlap have qualitatively distinct effects on the dynamics of coupled chaotic oscillators. In particular, large values of intra-order hyperedge overlap hamper synchronization by favoring the presence of disconnected sets of hyperedges, while large values of inter-order hyperedge overlap hinder synchronization by increasing the number of shared nodes between groups converging on different trajectories, without necessarily causing disconnected sets of hyperedges.</description>

      <title>On How Traffic Signals Impact the Fundamental Diagrams of Urban Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being widely adopted by the transportation and planning practitioners, the fundamental diagram (FD) is the primary tool used to relate the key macroscopic traffic variables of speed, flow, and density. We empirically analyze the relation between vehicular space-mean speeds and flows given different signal settings and postulate a parsimonious parametric function form of the traditional FD where its function parameters are explicitly modeled as a function of the signal plan factors. We validate the proposed formulation using data from signalized urban road segments in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The proposed formulation builds our understanding of how changes to signal settings impact the FDs, and more generally the congestion patterns, of signalized urban segments.</description>

      <title>Astronomy and Society: The Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06538v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomy, of all the sciences, is possibly the one with the most public appeal across all age groups. This is also evidenced by the existence of a large number of planetaria and amateur astronomy societies, which is unique to the field. Astronomy is known as a `gateway science', with an ability to attract students who then proceed to explore their interest in other STEM fields too. Astronomy's link to society is therefore substantive and diverse. In this white paper, six key areas are analysed, namely outreach and communication, astronomy education, history and heritage, astronomy for development, diversity, and hiring practices for outreach personnel.
  The current status of each of these areas is described, followed by an analysis of what is needed for the future. A set of recommendations for institutions, funding agencies, and individuals are evolved for each specific area. This work charts out the vision for how the astronomy-society connection should take shape in the future, and attempts to provide a road-map for the various stakeholders involved.</description>

      <title>Inference precision about an aircraft crash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Problem-based learning benefits from situations taken from real life, which arouse student interest. The shooting of Rwanda president aircraft on April 6th, 1994 is still unsolved. We discuss the methods to infer informations and conclusions about where the aircraft was shot and its trajectory during its fall, as well as about the place from which the missiles were launched, their trajectory and type. To this goal, we compile expert reports, witness indications and other public sources, then translate plain language sentences into quantitative equalities and inequalities applied to geometry and mechanics at undergraduate level. The precision of each result is discussed and propagated in order to ensure a proper assessment of the hypotheses and a traceability of their consequences. Overall, the precision discussion can train the students critical mind, and teach inference methods which are routinely used in several fields of physics research. In addition, it demonstrates the importance and limits of scientific expertise during a judiciary process.</description>

      <title>Community Aware Temporal Network Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advantages of temporal networks in capturing complex dynamics, such as diffusion and contagion, has led to breakthroughs in real world systems across numerous fields. In the case of human behavior, face-to-face interaction networks enable us to understand the dynamics of how communities emerge and evolve in time through the interactions, which is crucial in fields like epidemics, sociological studies and urban science. However, state-of-the-art datasets suffer from a number of drawbacks, such as short time-span for data collection and a small number of participants. Moreover, concerns arise for the participants' privacy and the data collection costs. Over the past years, many successful algorithms for static networks generation have been proposed, but they often do not tackle the social structure of interactions or their temporal aspect. In this work, we extend a recent network generation approach to capture the evolution of interactions between different communities. Our method labels nodes based on their community affiliation and constructs surrogate networks that reflect the interactions of the original temporal networks between nodes with different labels. This enables the generation of synthetic networks that replicate realistic behaviors. We validate our approach by comparing structural measures between the original and generated networks across multiple face-to-face interaction datasets.</description>

      <title>Extracting Participation in Collective Action from Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media play a key role in mobilizing collective action, holding the potential for studying the pathways that lead individuals to actively engage in addressing global challenges. However, quantitative research in this area has been limited by the absence of granular and large-scale ground truth about the level of participation in collective action among individual social media users. To address this limitation, we present a novel suite of text classifiers designed to identify expressions of participation in collective action from social media posts, in a topic-agnostic fashion. Grounded in the theoretical framework of social movement mobilization, our classification captures participation and categorizes it into four levels: recognizing collective issues, engaging in calls-to-action, expressing intention of action, and reporting active involvement. We constructed a labeled training dataset of Reddit comments through crowdsourcing, which we used to train BERT classifiers and fine-tune Llama3 models. Our findings show that smaller language models can reliably detect expressions of participation (weighted F1=0.71), and rival larger models in capturing nuanced levels of participation. By applying our methodology to Reddit, we illustrate its effectiveness as a robust tool for characterizing online communities in innovative ways compared to topic modeling, stance detection, and keyword-based methods. Our framework contributes to Computational Social Science research by providing a new source of reliable annotations useful for investigating the social dynamics of collective action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political polarization, a key driver of social fragmentation, has drawn increasing attention for its role in shaping online and offline discourse. Despite significant efforts, accurately measuring polarization within ideological distributions remains a challenge. This study evaluates five widely used polarization measures, testing their strengths and weaknesses with synthetic datasets and a real-world case study on YouTube discussions during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. Building on these findings, we present a novel adaptation of Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm to improve mode detection in polarized distributions. By offering both a critical review and an innovative methodological tool, this work advances the analysis of ideological patterns in social media discourse.</description>

Abstract: Music has always been central to human culture, reflecting and shaping traditions, emotions, and societal changes. Technological advancements have transformed how music is created and consumed, influencing tastes and the music itself. In this study, we use Network Science to analyze musical complexity. Drawing on $\approx20,000$ MIDI files across six macro-genres spanning nearly four centuries, we represent each composition as a weighted directed network to study its structural properties. Our results show that Classical and Jazz compositions have higher complexity and melodic diversity than recently developed genres. However, a temporal analysis reveals a trend toward simplification, with even Classical and Jazz nearing the complexity levels of modern genres. This study highlights how digital tools and streaming platforms shape musical evolution, fostering new genres while driving homogenization and simplicity.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Power Law: Estimation, Goodness-of-Fit, and a Semiparametric Extension in Complex Networks</title>

Abstract: Scale-free networks play a fundamental role in the study of complex networks and various applied fields due to their ability to model a wide range of real-world systems. A key characteristic of these networks is their degree distribution, which often follows a power-law distribution, where the probability mass function is proportional to $x^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ typically ranging between $2 &lt; \alpha &lt; 3$. In this paper, we introduce Bayesian inference methods to obtain more accurate estimates than those obtained using traditional methods, which often yield biased estimates, and precise credible intervals. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that our approach provides nearly unbiased estimates for the scaling parameter, enhancing the reliability of inferences. We also evaluate new goodness-of-fit tests to improve the effectiveness of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, commonly used for this purpose. Our findings show that the Watson test offers superior power while maintaining a controlled type I error rate, enabling us to better determine whether data adheres to a power-law distribution. Finally, we propose a piecewise extension of this model to provide greater flexibility, evaluating the estimation and its goodness-of-fit features as well. In the complex networks field, this extension allows us to model the full degree distribution, instead of just focusing on the tail, as is commonly done. We demonstrate the utility of these novel methods through applications to two real-world datasets, showcasing their practical relevance and potential to advance the analysis of power-law behavior.</description>

      <title>Echo chamber effects in signed networks</title>

Abstract: Echo chamber effects in social networks are generally attributed to the prevalence of interactions among like-minded peers. However, recent evidence has emphasized the role of hostile interactions between opposite-minded groups. We investigate the role of polarization, identified with structural balance, in the formation of echo chambers in signed networks. To do so, we generalize the Independent Cascade Model and the Linear Threshold Model to describe information propagation in presence of negative edges. Antagonistic connections do not disrupt the flow of information, but instead, alter the way information is framed. Our results show that echo chambers spontaneously emerge in balanced networks, but also in antibalanced ones for specific parameters. This highlights that structural polarization and echo chambers do not necessarily display a one-to-one correspondence, showing instead a complex and often counterintuitive interplay. The robustness of our results is confirmed with a complex contagion model and through simulations in different network topologies, including real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Percolation analysis of spatiotemporal distribution of population in Seoul and Helsinki</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal distribution of urban population is crucial to understand the structure and dynamics of cities. Most studies, however, have focused on the microscopic structure of cities such as their few most crowded areas. In this work, we investigate the macroscopic structure of cities such as their clusters of highly populated areas. To do this, we analyze the spatial distribution of urban population and its intraday dynamics in Seoul and Helsinki with a percolation framework. We observe that the growth patterns of the largest clusters in the real and randomly shuffled population data are significantly different, and highly populated areas during the daytime are denser and form larger clusters than highly populated areas during the nighttime. An analysis of the cluster-size distributions at percolation criticality shows that their power-law exponents during the daytime are lower than those during the nighttime, indicating that the spatial distributions of urban population during daytime and nighttime fall into different universality classes. Finally measuring the area-perimeter fractal dimension of the collection of clusters demonstrates that the fractal dimensions during the daytime are higher than those during the nighttime, indicating that the perimeters of clusters during the daytime are rougher than those during the nighttime. Our findings suggest that even the same city can have qualitatively different spatial distributions of population over time, and propose a way to quantitatively compare the macrostructure of cities based on population distribution data.</description>

      <title>The Grass of the Universe: Rethinking Technosphere, Planetary History, and Sustainability with Fermi Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SETI is not a usual point of departure for environmental humanities. However, this paper argues that theories originating in this field have direct implications for how we think about viable inhabitation of the Earth. To demonstrate SETI's impact on environmental humanities, this paper introduces Fermi paradox as a speculative tool to probe possible trajectories of planetary history, and especially the "Sustainability Solution" proposed by Jacob Haqq-Misra and Seth Baum. This solution suggests that sustainable coupling between extraterrestrial intelligences and their planetary environments is the major factor in the possibility of their successful detection by remote observation. By positing that exponential growth is not a sustainable development pattern, this solution rules out space-faring civilizations colonizing solar systems or galaxies. This paper elaborates on Haqq-Misra's and Baum's arguments, and discusses speculative implications of the Sustainability Solution, thus rethinking three concepts in environmental humanities: technosphere, planetary history, and sustainability. The paper advocates that (1) technosphere is a transitory layer that shall fold back into biosphere; (2) planetary history must be understood in a generic perspective that abstracts from terrestrial particularities; and (3) sustainability is not sufficient vector of viable human inhabitation of the Earth, suggesting instead habitability and genesity as better candidates.</description>

      <title>Multiway Alignment of Political Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The related concepts of partisan belief systems, issue alignment, and partisan sorting are central to our understanding of politics. These phenomena have been studied using measures of alignment between pairs of topics, or how much individuals' attitudes toward a topic reveal about their attitudes toward another topic. We introduce a higher-order measure that extends the assessment of alignment beyond pairs of topics by quantifying the amount of information individuals' opinions on one topic reveal about a set of topics simultaneously. Applying this approach to legislative voting behavior shows that parliamentary systems typically exhibit similar multiway alignment characteristics, but can change in response to shifting intergroup dynamics. In American National Election Studies surveys, our approach reveals a growing significance of party identification together with a consistent rise in multiway alignment over time.</description>
