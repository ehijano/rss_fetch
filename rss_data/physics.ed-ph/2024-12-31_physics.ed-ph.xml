      <title>Incentivizing supplemental math assignments and using AI-generated hints improve exam performance, especially for racially minoritized students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inequities in student access to trigonometry and calculus are often associated with racial and socioeconomic privilege, and are often propagated to introductory physics course performance. To mitigate these disparities in student preparedness, we developed a two-pronged intervention consisting of (1) incentivized supplemental mathematics assignments and (2) AI-generated learning support tools in the forms of optional hints embedded in the physics assignments. Both interventions are grounded in the Situated Expectancy-Value Theory of Achievement Motivation, which posits that students are more likely to complete a task that they expect to do well in and whose outcomes they think are valuable. For the supplemental math assignments, the extra credit available was scaled to make it worth more points for the students with lower exam scores, thereby creating even greater value for the students who might most benefit from the assignments. For the AI-generated hints, these were integrated into the homework assignments, thereby reducing or eliminating the cost to the student, in terms of time, energy, and social barriers or fear of judgment. Our findings indicate that both these interventions are associated with increased exam scores; in particular, the scaled extra credit reduced disparities in completion of math supplemental material and was associated with reducing racial disparities in exam scores. These interventions, which are relatively simple for any instructor to implement, are therefore very promising for creating more equitable undergraduate quantitative-based courses.</description>

      <title>AI-Supported Data Analysis Boosts Student Motivation and Reduces Stress in Physics Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in physics education enables novel approaches to data analysis and conceptual learning. A comparative analysis of AI-supported and traditional Excel-based methods reveals distinct strengths and limitations in fostering understanding of pendulum experiments. This study explores the integration of AI-assisted tools, such as a custom chatbot based on ChatGPT, and traditional Excel-based methods in physics education, revealing that while both approaches produce comparable quantitative learning gains, AI tools provide significant qualitative advantages. These include enhanced emotional engagement and higher motivation, highlighting the potential of AI to create a more positive and supportive learning environment. Adaptive AI technologies offer significant promise in supporting structured, data-intensive tasks, emphasizing the necessity for thoughtfully balanced integration into educational practices.</description>
