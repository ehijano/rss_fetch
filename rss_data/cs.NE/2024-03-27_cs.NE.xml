      <title>Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity for Crystal Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structures are indispensable across various domains, from batteries to solar cells, and extensive research has been dedicated to predicting their properties based on their atomic configurations. However, prevailing Crystal Structure Prediction methods focus on identifying the most stable solutions that lie at the global minimum of the energy function. This approach overlooks other potentially interesting materials that lie in neighbouring local minima and have different material properties such as conductivity or resistance to deformation. By contrast, Quality-Diversity algorithms provide a promising avenue for Crystal Structure Prediction as they aim to find a collection of high-performing solutions that have diverse characteristics. However, it may also be valuable to optimise for the stability of crystal structures alongside other objectives such as magnetism or thermoelectric efficiency. Therefore, in this work, we harness the power of Multi-Objective Quality-Diversity algorithms in order to find crystal structures which have diverse features and achieve different trade-offs of objectives. We analyse our approach on 5 crystal systems and demonstrate that it is not only able to re-discover known real-life structures, but also find promising new ones. Moreover, we propose a method for illuminating the objective space to gain an understanding of what trade-offs can be achieved.</description>

      <title>SGHormer: An Energy-Saving Graph Transformer Driven by Spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) with powerful representation learning ability make a huge success in wide range of graph tasks. However, the costs behind outstanding performances of GTs are higher energy consumption and computational overhead. The complex structure and quadratic complexity during attention calculation in vanilla transformer seriously hinder its scalability on the large-scale graph data. Though existing methods have made strides in simplifying combinations among blocks or attention-learning paradigm to improve GTs' efficiency, a series of energy-saving solutions originated from biologically plausible structures are rarely taken into consideration when constructing GT framework. To this end, we propose a new spiking-based graph transformer (SGHormer). It turns full-precision embeddings into sparse and binarized spikes to reduce memory and computational costs. The spiking graph self-attention and spiking rectify blocks in SGHormer explicitly capture global structure information and recover the expressive power of spiking embeddings, respectively. In experiments, SGHormer achieves comparable performances to other full-precision GTs with extremely low computational energy consumption. The results show that SGHomer makes a remarkable progress in the field of low-energy GTs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Representation Learning with Attention-Driven Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Graph representation learning has become a crucial task in machine learning and data mining due to its potential for modeling complex structures such as social networks, chemical compounds, and biological systems. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional neural networks for graph learning tasks, benefiting from their ability to efficiently encode and process temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates attention mechanisms with SNNs to improve graph representation learning. Specifically, we introduce an attention mechanism for SNN that can selectively focus on important nodes and corresponding features in a graph during the learning process. We evaluate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets and show that it achieves comparable performance compared to existing graph learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Learning Traffic Signal Control via Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method.</description>

      <title>Chain of Compression: A Systematic Approach to Combinationally Compress Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant popularity, but their computational and memory intensity poses challenges for resource-constrained computing systems, particularly with the prerequisite of real-time performance. To release this burden, model compression has become an important research focus. Many approaches like quantization, pruning, early exit, and knowledge distillation have demonstrated the effect of reducing redundancy in neural networks. Upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that each approach capitalizes on its unique features to compress the neural network, and they can also exhibit complementary behavior when combined. To explore the interactions and reap the benefits from the complementary features, we propose the Chain of Compression, which works on the combinational sequence to apply these common techniques to compress the neural network. Validated on the image-based regression and classification networks across different data sets, our proposed Chain of Compression can significantly compress the computation cost by 100-1000 times with ignorable accuracy loss compared with the baseline model.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model for Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization</title>

Abstract: Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are major methods for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). Many MOEAs have been proposed in the past decades, of which the search operators need a carefully handcrafted design with domain knowledge. Recently, some attempts have been made to replace the manually designed operators in MOEAs with learning-based operators (e.g., neural network models). However, much effort is still required for designing and training such models, and the learned operators might not generalize well on new problems. To tackle the above challenges, this work investigates a novel approach that leverages the powerful large language model (LLM) to design MOEA operators. With proper prompt engineering, we successfully let a general LLM serve as a black-box search operator for decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D) in a zero-shot manner. In addition, by learning from the LLM behavior, we further design an explicit white-box operator with randomness and propose a new version of decomposition-based MOEA, termed MOEA/D-LO. Experimental studies on different test benchmarks show that our proposed method can achieve competitive performance with widely used MOEAs. It is also promising to see the operator only learned from a few instances can have robust generalization performance on unseen problems with quite different patterns and settings. The results reveal the potential benefits of using pre-trained LLMs in the design of MOEAs.To foster reproducibility and accessibility, the source code is https://github.com/FeiLiu36/LLM4MOEA.</description>

      <title>Spiking Wavelet Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning by mimicking the event-driven processing of the brain. Incorporating the Transformers with SNNs has shown promise for accuracy, yet it is incompetent to capture high-frequency patterns like moving edge and pixel-level brightness changes due to their reliance on global self-attention operations. Porting frequency representations in SNN is challenging yet crucial for event-driven vision. To address this issue, we propose the Spiking Wavelet Transformer (SWformer), an attention-free architecture that effectively learns comprehensive spatial-frequency features in a spike-driven manner by leveraging the sparse wavelet transform. The critical component is a Frequency-Aware Token Mixer (FATM) with three branches: 1) spiking wavelet learner for spatial-frequency domain learning, 2) convolution-based learner for spatial feature extraction, and 3) spiking pointwise convolution for cross-channel information aggregation. We also adopt negative spike dynamics to strengthen the frequency representation further. This enables the SWformer to outperform vanilla Spiking Transformers in capturing high-frequency visual components, as evidenced by our empirical results. Experiments on both static and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate SWformer's effectiveness in capturing spatial-frequency patterns in a multiplication-free, event-driven fashion, outperforming state-of-the-art SNNs. SWformer achieves an over 50% reduction in energy consumption, a 21.1% reduction in parameter count, and a 2.40% performance improvement on the ImageNet dataset compared to vanilla Spiking Transformers.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear African Vulture Optimization Algorithm Combining Henon Chaotic Mapping Theory and Reverse Learning Competition Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to alleviate the main shortcomings of the AVOA, a nonlinear African vulture optimization algorithm combining Henon chaotic mapping theory and reverse learning competition strategy (HWEAVOA) is proposed. Firstly, the Henon chaotic mapping theory and elite population strategy are proposed to improve the randomness and diversity of the vulture's initial population; Furthermore, the nonlinear adaptive incremental inertial weight factor is introduced in the location update phase to rationally balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, and avoid individual falling into a local optimum; The reverse learning competition strategy is designed to expand the discovery fields for the optimal solution and strengthen the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. HWEAVOA and other advanced comparison algorithms are used to solve classical and CEC2022 test functions. Compared with other algorithms, the convergence curves of the HWEAVOA drop faster and the line bodies are smoother. These experimental results show the proposed HWEAVOA is ranked first in all test functions, which is superior to the comparison algorithms in convergence speed, optimization ability, and solution stability. Meanwhile, HWEAVOA has reached the general level in the algorithm complexity, and its overall performance is competitive in the swarm intelligence algorithms.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models Generate Images Like Painters: an Analytical Theory of Outline First, Details Later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do diffusion generative models convert pure noise into meaningful images? In a variety of pretrained diffusion models (including conditional latent space models like Stable Diffusion), we observe that the reverse diffusion process that underlies image generation has the following properties: (i) individual trajectories tend to be low-dimensional and resemble 2D `rotations'; (ii) high-variance scene features like layout tend to emerge earlier, while low-variance details tend to emerge later; and (iii) early perturbations tend to have a greater impact on image content than later perturbations. To understand these phenomena, we derive and study a closed-form solution to the probability flow ODE for a Gaussian distribution, which shows that the reverse diffusion state rotates towards a gradually-specified target on the image manifold. It also shows that generation involves first committing to an outline, and then to finer and finer details. We find that this solution accurately describes the initial phase of image generation for pretrained models, and can in principle be used to make image generation more efficient by skipping reverse diffusion steps. Finally, we use our solution to characterize the image manifold in Stable Diffusion. Our viewpoint reveals an unexpected similarity between generation by GANs and diffusion and provides a conceptual link between diffusion and image retrieval.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically Rewired Message-Passing Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) emerged as powerful tools for processing graph-structured input. However, they operate on a fixed input graph structure, ignoring potential noise and missing information. Furthermore, their local aggregation mechanism can lead to problems such as over-squashing and limited expressive power in capturing relevant graph structures. Existing solutions to these challenges have primarily relied on heuristic methods, often disregarding the underlying data distribution. Hence, devising principled approaches for learning to infer graph structures relevant to the given prediction task remains an open challenge. In this work, leveraging recent progress in exact and differentiable $k$-subset sampling, we devise probabilistically rewired MPNNs (PR-MPNNs), which learn to add relevant edges while omitting less beneficial ones. For the first time, our theoretical analysis explores how PR-MPNNs enhance expressive power, and we identify precise conditions under which they outperform purely randomized approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates issues like over-squashing and under-reaching. In addition, on established real-world datasets, our method exhibits competitive or superior predictive performance compared to traditional MPNN models and recent graph transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Two-compartment neuronal spiking model expressing brain-state specific apical-amplification, -isolation and -drive regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mounting experimental evidence suggests that brain-state-specific neural mechanisms, supported by connectomic architectures, play a crucial role in integrating past and contextual knowledge with the current, incoming flow of evidence (e.g., from sensory systems). These mechanisms operate across multiple spatial and temporal scales, necessitating dedicated support at the levels of individual neurons and synapses. A notable feature within the neocortex is the structure of large, deep pyramidal neurons, which exhibit a distinctive separation between an apical dendritic compartment and a basal dendritic/perisomatic compartment. This separation is characterized by distinct patterns of incoming connections and brain-state-specific activation mechanisms, namely, apical amplification, isolation, and drive, which are associated with wakefulness, deeper NREM sleep stages, and REM sleep, respectively. The cognitive roles of apical mechanisms have been demonstrated in behaving animals. In contrast, classical models of learning in spiking networks are based on single-compartment neurons, lacking the ability to describe the integration of apical and basal/somatic information. This work aims to provide the computational community with a two-compartment spiking neuron model that incorporates features essential for supporting brain-state-specific learning. This model includes a piece-wise linear transfer function (ThetaPlanes) at the highest abstraction level, making it suitable for use in large-scale bio-inspired artificial intelligence systems. A machine learning evolutionary algorithm, guided by a set of fitness functions, selected the parameters that define neurons expressing the desired apical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoders Are Robust Neural Architecture Search Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) currently relies heavily on labeled data, which is both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS framework based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE) that eliminates the need for labeled data during the search process. By replacing the supervised learning objective with an image reconstruction task, our approach enables the robust discovery of network architectures without compromising performance and generalization ability. Additionally, we address the problem of performance collapse encountered in the widely-used Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) method in the unsupervised paradigm by introducing a multi-scale decoder. Through extensive experiments conducted on various search spaces and datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, providing empirical evidence of its superiority over baseline approaches.</description>
