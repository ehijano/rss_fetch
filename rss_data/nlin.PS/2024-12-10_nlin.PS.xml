      <title>Two-dimensional fractional discrete NLS equations: dispersion relations, rogue waves, fundamental and vortex solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce physically relevant new models of two-dimensional (2D) fractional lattice media accounting for the interplay of fractional intersite coupling and onsite self-focusing. Our approach features novel discrete fractional operators based on an appropriately modified definition of the continuous Riesz fractional derivative. The model of the 2D isotropic lattice employs the discrete fractional Laplacian, whereas the 2D anisotropic system incorporates discrete fractional derivatives acting independently along orthogonal directions with different L\'evy indices (LIs). We derive exact linear dispersion relations (DRs), and identify spectral bands that permit linear modes to exist, finding them to be similar to their continuous counterparts, apart from differences in the wavenumber range. Additionally, the modulational instability in the discrete models is studied in detail, and, akin to the linear DRs, it is found to align with the situation in continuous models. This consistency highlights the nature of our newly defined discrete fractional derivatives. Furthermore, using Gaussian inputs, we produce a variety of rogue-wave structures. By means of numerical methods, we systematically construct families of 2D fundamental and vortex solitons, and examine their stability. Fundamental solitons maintain the stability due to the discrete nature of the interactions, preventing the onset of the critical and supercritical collapse. On the other hand, vortex solitons are unstable in the isotropic lattice model. However, the anisotropic one -- in particular, its symmetric version with equal LIs acting in both directions -- maintains stable vortex solitons with winding numbers $S=1$ and $S=3$. The detailed results stress the robustness of the newly defined discrete fractional Laplacian in supporting well-defined soliton modes in the 2D lattice media.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theory for the Formation of Chimera Patterns in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chimera states, marked by the coexistence of order and disorder in systems of coupled oscillators, have captivated researchers with their existence and intricate patterns. Despite ongoing advances, a fully understanding of the genesis of chimera states remains challenging. This work formalizes a systematic method by evoking pattern formation theory to explain the emergence of chimera states in complex networks, in a similar way to how Turing patterns are produced. Employing linear stability analysis and the spectral properties of complex networks, we show that the randomness of network topology, as reflected in the localization of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors, determines the emergence of chimera patterns, underscoring the critical role of network structure. In particular, this approach explains how amplitude and phase chimeras arise separately and explores whether phase chimeras can be chaotic or not. Our findings suggest that chimeras result from the interplay between local and global dynamics at different time scales. Validated through simulations and empirical network analyses, our method enriches the understanding of coupled oscillator dynamics.</description>

      <title>Is the neural tangent kernel of PINNs deep learning general partial differential equations always convergent ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the neural tangent kernel (NTK) for general partial differential equations (PDEs) based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). As we all know, the training of an artificial neural network can be converted to the evolution of NTK. We analyze the initialization of NTK and the convergence conditions of NTK during training for general PDEs. The theoretical results show that the homogeneity of differential operators plays a crucial role for the convergence of NTK. Moreover, based on the PINNs, we validate the convergence conditions of NTK using the initial value problems of the sine-Gordon equation and the initial-boundary value problem of the KdV equation.</description>

      <title>Absence of the breakdown of ferrodark solitons exhibiting a snake instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical stability and real time dynamics of the two-types of ferrodark solitons (FDSs) which occur as topological magnetic domain walls in the easy-plane phase of a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The type-I FDS has positive inertial mass and exhibits a single dynamical instability that generates in plane spin winding, causing polar-core spin vortex dipoles. The positive inertial mass leads to the elastic oscillations of the soliton under transverse perturbations. The type-II FDS has negative inertial mass and exhibits a snake instability and a spin-twist instability, with the latter involving the generation of out of plane spin winding. Distinct from the normal dynamics of negative mass solitons under long wave length transverse perturbations, the snake instability does not lead to the type-II FDS breaking down. Instead, segments of the type-II FDS convert to type-I and mass vortex dipoles are produced. The resulting hybridized-chain of the two soliton types and vortices exhibits complex 2D soliton dynamics at long times while the vortices remain confined and the topological structure of a magnetic domain wall is preserved.</description>

      <title>Normal dispersion Kerr cavity solitons: beyond the mean field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict the existence of a novel type of temporal localized structure in injected Kerr--Gires--Tournois interferometers (KGTI). These bright pulses exist in the normal dispersion regime, yet they do not correspond to the usual scenario of domain wall locking that induces complex shape multistability, weak stability, and a reduced domain of existence. The new states are observed beyond the mean-field limit and out of the bistable region. Their shape is uniquely defined, with peak intensities beyond that of the upper steady state, and they are stable over a broad range of the injection field, highlighting their potential for optical frequency comb (OFC) generation.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions and data-driven discovery of higher-order Burgers' hierarchy equations with physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Burgers hierarchy consists of nonlinear evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) with progressively higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms. Notable members of this hierarchy are the Burgers equation and the Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation, which are widely applied in fields such as plasma physics, fluid mechanics, optics, and biophysics to describe nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media. Various soliton and multi-soliton solutions to these equations have been identified and the fission and fusion of solitons have been studied using analytical and numerical techniques. Recently, deep learning methods, particularly Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have emerged as a new approach for solving PDEs. These methods use deep neural networks to minimize PDE residuals while fitting relevant data. Although PINNs have been applied to equations like Burgers' and Korteweg-de Vries, higher-order members of the Burgers hierarchy remain unexplored in this context. In this study, we employ a PINN algorithm to approximate multi-soliton solutions of linear combinations of equations within the Burgers hierarchy. This semi-supervised approach encodes the PDE and relevant data, determining PDE parameters and resolving the linear combination to discover the PDE that describes the data. Additionally, we employ gradient-enhanced PINNs (gPINNs) and a conservation law, specific to the generic Burgers' hierarchy, to improve training accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in describing multi-soliton solutions within the generic Burgers' hierarchy, their robustness to increased levels of data noise, and their limited yet measurable predictive capabilities. They also verify the potential for training refinement and accuracy improvement using enhanced approaches in certain cases, while enabling the discovery of the PDE model that describes the observed solitary structures.</description>
