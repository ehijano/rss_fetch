      <title>ExposNet: A Deep Learning Framework for EMF Exposure Prediction in Complex Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of the electric field (E-field) plays a crucial role in monitoring radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure induced by cellular networks. In this paper, a deep learning framework is proposed to predict E-field levels in complex urban environments. First, the measurement campaign and publicly accessible databases used to construct the training dataset are introduced, with a detailed explanation provided on how these datasets are formulated and integrated to enhance their suitability for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based models. Then, the proposed model, ExposNet, is presented, and its network architecture and workflow are thoroughly explained. Two variations of the network structure are proposed, and extensive experimental analyses are conducted, demonstrating that ExposNet achieves good prediction accuracy with both configurations. Furthermore, the generalization capability of the model is evaluated. The overall results indicate that, despite being trained and tested on real-world measurements, the model performs well and achieves better accuracy compared to previous studies.</description>

      <title>Identification of High Impedance Faults Utilizing Recurrence Plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach to detecting High Impedance Faults (HIFs) in medium voltage distribution networks using recurrence plots and machine learning. We first simulate 1150 internal faults, including 300 HIFs, 1000 external faults, and 40 normal conditions using the PSCAD/EMTDC software. Key features are extracted from the 3-phase differential currents using wavelet coefficients, which are then converted into recurrence matrices. A multi-stage classification framework is employed, where the first classification stage identifies internal faults, and the second stage distinguishes HIFs from other internal faults. The framework is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Tree-based classifiers, particularly Random Forest and Decision Tree, achieve superior performance, with 99.24% accuracy in the first stage and 98.26% in the second. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating recurrence analysis with machine learning for fault detection in power distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Learning Precoding in Multi-user Multi-antenna Systems: Transformer or Graph Transformer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have been designed for channel acquisition tasks such as channel prediction and other tasks such as precoding, while graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to be efficient for learning a multitude of communication tasks. Nonetheless, whether or not Transformers are efficient for the tasks other than channel acquisition and how to reap the benefits of both architectures are less understood. In this paper, we take learning precoding policies in multi-user multi-antenna systems as an example to answer the questions. We notice that a Transformer tailored for precoding can reflect multiuser interference, which is essential for its generalizability to the number of users. Yet the tailored Transformer can only leverage partial permutation property of precoding policies and hence is not generalizable to the number of antennas, same as a GNN learning over a homogeneous graph. To provide useful insight, we establish the relation between Transformers and the GNNs that learn over heterogeneous graphs. Based on the relation, we propose Graph Transformers, namely 2D- and 3D-Gformers, for exploiting the permutation properties of baseband precoding and hybrid precoding policies. The learning performance, inference and training complexity, and size-generalizability of the Gformers are evaluated and compared with Transformers and GNNs via simulations.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and RIS-aided Track-Before-Detect Radar Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an integrated sensing and communication system where the base station serves multiple downlink users, while employing a passive reconfigurable intelligent surface to detect small, noncooperative airborne targets. We propose a method to design the two-way beampattern of the RIS-assisted monostatic radar, which allows controlling the sidelobe levels in the presence of eavesdroppers, jammers, and other scattering objects and avoiding any radar interference to the users. To obtain more favorable system tradeoffs, we exploit the correlation of the target echoes over consecutive scans by resorting to a multi-frame radar detector, which includes a detector, a plot-extractor, and a track-before-detect processor. A numerical analysis is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and to assess the achievable tradeoffs. Our results show that, by increasing the number of scans processed by the radar detector (and therefore its implementation complexity), we can reduce the amount of power dedicated to the radar function while maintaining the same sensing performance (measured in terms of probability of target detection and root mean square error in the estimation of target position); this excess power can be reused to increase the user sum-rate.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Meets Fluid Antenna: Towards Robust and Scalable Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm with immense potential to support advanced services and applications in future industries. However, when deployed over wireless communication systems, FL suffers from significant communication overhead, which can be alleviated by integrating over-the-air computation (AirComp). Despite its advantages, AirComp introduces learning inaccuracies due to the inherent randomness of wireless channels, which can degrade overall learning performance. To address this issue, this paper explores the integration of fluid antenna systems (FAS) into AirComp-based FL to enhance system robustness and efficiency. Fluid antennas offer dynamic spatial diversity by adaptively selecting antenna ports, thereby mitigating channel variations and improving signal aggregation. Specifically, we propose an antenna selection rule for fluid-antenna-equipped devices that optimally enhances learning robustness or training performance. Building on this, we develop a learning algorithm and provide a theoretical convergence analysis. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of fluid antennas in improving FL performance, demonstrating their potential as a key enabler for wireless AI applications.</description>

      <title>Determinantal Learning for Subset Selection in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subset selection is central to many wireless communication problems, including link scheduling, power allocation, and spectrum management. However, these problems are often NP-complete, because of which heuristic algorithms applied to solve these problems struggle with scalability in large-scale settings. To address this, we propose a determinantal point process-based learning (DPPL) framework for efficiently solving general subset selection problems in massive networks. The key idea is to model the optimal subset as a realization of a determinantal point process (DPP), which balances the trade-off between quality (signal strength) and similarity (mutual interference) by enforcing negative correlation in the selection of {\em similar} links (those that create significant mutual interference). However, conventional methods for constructing similarity matrices in DPP impose decomposability and symmetry constraints that often do not hold in practice. To overcome this, we introduce a new method based on the Gershgorin Circle Theorem for constructing valid similarity matrices. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to two canonical wireless network settings: an ad hoc network in 2D and a cellular network serving drones in 3D. Simulation results show that DPPL selects near-optimal subsets that maximize network sum-rate while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to traditional optimization methods, demonstrating its scalability for large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Joint Bistatic Positioning and Monostatic Sensing: Optimized Beamforming and Performance Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate joint bistatic positioning (BP) and monostatic sensing (MS) within a multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency-division system. Based on the derived Cram\'er-Rao Bounds (CRBs), we propose novel beamforming optimization strategies that enable flexible performance trade-offs between BP and MS. Two distinct objectives are considered in this multi-objective optimization problem, namely, enabling user equipment to estimate its own position while accounting for unknown clock bias and orientation, and allowing the base station to locate passive targets. We first analyze digital schemes, proposing both weighted-sum CRB and weighted-sum mismatch (of beamformers and covariance matrices) minimization approaches. These are examined under full-dimension beamforming (FDB) and low-complexity codebook-based power allocation (CPA). To adapt to low-cost hardwares, we develop unit-amplitude analog FDB and CPA schemes based on the weighted-sum mismatch of the covariance matrices paradigm, solved using distinct methods. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our designs, highlighting the superiority of minimizing the weighted-sum mismatch of covariance matrices, and the advantages of mutual information fusion between BP and MS.</description>

      <title>Distributed Distortion-Aware Beamforming Designs for Cell-Free mMIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency and coverage through distributed antenna arrays. However, the non-linearity of power amplifiers (PAs) in these arrays introduce spatial distortion, which may significantly degrade system performance. This paper presents the first investigation of distortion-aware beamforming in a distributed framework tailored for CF-mMIMO systems, enabling pre-compensation for beam dispersion caused by nonlinear PA distortion. Using a third-order memoryless polynomial distortion model, the impact of the nonlinear PA on the performance of CF-mMIMO systems is firstly analyzed by evaluating the signal-to-interference-noise-and-distortion ratio (SINDR) at user equipment (UE). Then, we develop two distributed distortion-aware beamforming designs based on ring topology and star topology, respectively. In particular, the ring-topology-based fully-distributed approach reduces interconnection costs and computational complexity, while the star-topology-based partially-distributed scheme leverages the superior computation capability of the central processor to achieve improved sum-rate performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distortion-aware beamforming designs in mitigating the effect of nonlinear PA distortion, while also reducing computational complexity and backhaul information exchange in CF-mMIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Tri-timescale Beamforming Design for Tri-hybrid Architectures with Reconfigurable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas possess the capability to dynamically adjust their fundamental operating characteristics, thereby enhancing system adaptability and performance. To fully exploit this flexibility in modern wireless communication systems, this paper considers a novel tri-hybrid beamforming architecture, which seamlessly integrates pattern-reconfigurable antennas with both analog and digital beamforming. The proposed tri-hybrid architecture operates across three layers: (\textit{i}) a radiation beamformer in the electromagnetic (EM) domain for dynamic pattern alignment, (\textit{ii}) an analog beamformer in the radio-frequency (RF) domain for array gain enhancement, and (\textit{iii}) a digital beamformer in the baseband (BB) domain for multi-user interference mitigation. To establish a solid theoretical foundation, we first develop a comprehensive mathematical model for the tri-hybrid beamforming system and formulate the signal model for a multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenario. The optimization objective is to maximize the sum-rate while satisfying practical constraints. Given the challenges posed by high pilot overhead and computational complexity, we introduce an innovative tri-timescale beamforming framework, wherein the radiation beamformer is optimized over a long-timescale, the analog beamformer over a medium-timescale, and the digital beamformer over a short-timescale. This hierarchical strategy effectively balances performance and implementation feasibility. Simulation results validate the performance gains of the proposed tri-hybrid architecture and demonstrate that the tri-timescale design significantly reduces pilot overhead and computational complexity, highlighting its potential for future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity-Free Broadband DOA Estimation Relying on Parameterized Time-Frequency Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ambiguity-free direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation scheme is proposed for sparse uniform linear arrays under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and non-stationary broadband signals. First, for achieving better DOA estimation performance at low SNRs while using non-stationary signals compared to the conventional frequency-difference (FD) paradigms, we propose parameterized time-frequency transform-based FD processing. Then, the unambiguous compressive FD beamforming is conceived to compensate the resolution loss induced by difference operation. Finally, we further derive a coarse-to-fine histogram statistics scheme to alleviate the perturbation in compressive FD beamforming with good DOA estimation accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm regarding robustness, resolution, and DOA estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Routing in Wireless Communications via Learnable State-Augmented Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of packet-based information routing in large-scale wireless communication networks. The problem is framed as a constrained statistical learning task, where each network node operates using only local information. Opportunistic routing exploits the broadcast nature of wireless communication to dynamically select optimal forwarding nodes, enabling the information to reach the destination through multiple relay nodes simultaneously. To solve this, we propose a State-Augmentation (SA) based distributed optimization approach aimed at maximizing the total information handled by the source nodes in the network. The problem formulation leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which perform graph convolutions based on the topological connections between network nodes. Using an unsupervised learning paradigm, we extract routing policies from the GNN architecture, enabling optimal decisions for source nodes across various flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when training a GNN-parameterized model, particularly when compared to baseline algorithms. Additionally, applying the method to real-world network topologies and wireless ad-hoc network test beds validates its effectiveness, highlighting the robustness and transferability of GNNs.</description>

      <title>MIMO-PASS: Uplink and Downlink Transmission via MIMO Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) are a recent flexible-antenna technology that is realized by attaching simple components, referred to as pinching elements, to dielectric waveguides. This work explores the potential of deploying PASS for uplink and downlink transmission in multiuser MIMO settings. For downlink PASS-aided communication, we formulate the optimal hybrid beamforming, in which the digital precoding matrix at the access point and the location of pinching elements on the waveguides are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable weighted sum-rate. Invoking fractional programming and Gauss-Seidel approach, we propose two low-complexity algorithms to iteratively update the precoding matrix and activated locations of the pinching elements. We further study uplink transmission aided by a PASS, where an iterative scheme is designed to address the underlying hybrid multiuser detection problem. We validate the proposed schemes through extensive numerical experiments. The results demonstrate that using a PASS, the throughput in both uplink and downlink is boosted significantly as compared with baseline MIMO architectures, such as massive MIMO~and classical hybrid analog-digital designs. This highlights the great potential of PASSs, making it a promising reconfigurable antenna technology for next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Sensing Rate Optimization for Multi-Band Cooperative ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the key technologies for future wireless networks, which potentially need to operate in multiple frequency bands to satisfy ever-increasing demands for both communication and sensing services. Motivated by this, we consider the sum sensing rate (SR) optimization for a cooperative ISAC system with linear precoding, where each base station (BS) works in a different frequency band. With this aim, we propose an optimization algorithm based on the semi-definite rank relaxation that introduces covariance matrices as optimization variables, and we apply the inner approximation (IA) method to deal with the nonconvexity of the resulting problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm increases the SR by approximately 25 % and 40 % compared to the case of equal power distribution in a cooperative ISAC system with two and three BSs, respectively. Additionally, the algorithm converges in only a few iterations, while its most optimal implementation scenario is in the low power regime.</description>

Abstract: We offer a new in-depth investigation of global path planning (GPP) for unmanned ground vehicles, an autonomous mining sampling robot named ROMIE. GPP is essential for ROMIE's optimal performance, which is translated into solving the traveling salesman problem, a complex graph theory challenge that is crucial for determining the most effective route to cover all sampling locations in a mining field. This problem is central to enhancing ROMIE's operational efficiency and competitiveness against human labor by optimizing cost and time. The primary aim of this research is to advance GPP by developing, evaluating, and improving a cost-efficient software and web application. We delve into an extensive comparison and analysis of Google operations research (OR)-Tools optimization algorithms. Our study is driven by the goal of applying and testing the limits of OR-Tools capabilities by integrating Reinforcement Learning techniques for the first time. This enables us to compare these methods with OR-Tools, assessing their computational effectiveness and real-world application efficiency. Our analysis seeks to provide insights into the effectiveness and practical application of each technique. Our findings indicate that Q-Learning stands out as the optimal strategy, demonstrating superior efficiency by deviating only 1.2% on average from the optimal solutions across our datasets.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Multi-Target Multi-User ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: How Many Sensing Beams Are Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a multi-target multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users in the downlink and senses the unknown and random angle information of multiple targets based on their reflected echo signals at the BS receiver as well as their prior probability information. We focus on a general beamforming structure with both communication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly non-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but introduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we first characterize the periodic posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize the beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to ensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at multiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams needed. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in various cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are derived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate constraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming optimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By applying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution and its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities. We derive a general bound and various tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed beamforming designs.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Experimental and Theoretical Mechanical Jitter in a THz Communication Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of mechanical vibration (jitter) is an increasingly important parameter for next-generation, long-distance wireless communication links and the channel models used for their engineering. Existing investigations of jitter effects on the terahertz (THz) backhaul channel are theoretical and derived primarily from free space optical models. These lack an empirical and validated treatment of the true statistical nature of antenna motion. We present novel experimental data which reveals that the statistical nature of mechanical jitter in 6G links is more complex than previously assumed. An unexpected multimodal distribution is discovered, which cannot be fit with the commonly cited model. These results compel the refinement of THz channel models under jitter and the resulting system performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Action Quality Assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Action quality assessment (AQA) is to assess how well an action is performed. Previous works perform modelling by only the use of visual information, ignoring audio information. We argue that although AQA is highly dependent on visual information, the audio is useful complementary information for improving the score regression accuracy, especially for sports with background music, such as figure skating and rhythmic gymnastics. To leverage multimodal information for AQA, i.e., RGB, optical flow and audio information, we propose a Progressive Adaptive Multimodal Fusion Network (PAMFN) that separately models modality-specific information and mixed-modality information. Our model consists of with three modality-specific branches that independently explore modality-specific information and a mixed-modality branch that progressively aggregates the modality-specific information from the modality-specific branches. To build the bridge between modality-specific branches and the mixed-modality branch, three novel modules are proposed. First, a Modality-specific Feature Decoder module is designed to selectively transfer modality-specific information to the mixed-modality branch. Second, when exploring the interaction between modality-specific information, we argue that using an invariant multimodal fusion policy may lead to suboptimal results, so as to take the potential diversity in different parts of an action into consideration. Therefore, an Adaptive Fusion Module is proposed to learn adaptive multimodal fusion policies in different parts of an action. This module consists of several FusionNets for exploring different multimodal fusion strategies and a PolicyNet for deciding which FusionNets are enabled. Third, a module called Cross-modal Feature Decoder is designed to transfer cross-modal features generated by Adaptive Fusion Module to the mixed-modality branch.</description>

      <title>Improved Estimation Accuracy in OFDM-based Joint Communication and Sensing through Kalman Tracking and Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12464v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a monostatic orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system for object tracking. Our setup consists of a transmitter and receiver equipped with an antenna array for fully digital beamforming. The native resolution of range and velocity in all radar-like sensing, including OFDM radar sensing, is limited by the observation time and bandwidth. In this work, we improve the parameter estimates (estimates of range) through interpolation methods and tracking algorithms. We verify our method by comparing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the estimated range, velocity and angle and by comparing the mean Euclidean distance between the estimated and true position. We demonstrate how both a Kalman filter for tracking, and interpolation methods using zero-padding and the chirp Z-transform (CZT) improve the estimation error. We discuss the computational complexity of the different methods. We propose the KalmanCZT approach that combines tracking via Kalman filtering and interpolation via the CZT, resulting in a solution with flexible resolution that significantly improves the range RMSE.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Wireless Networks: Deployment Architectures, Key Solutions, and Field Trials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a transformative technology for wireless networks by improving coverage, capacity, and energy efficiency through intelligent manipulation of wireless propagation environments. This paper provides a comprehensive study on the deployment and coordination of IRSs for wireless networks. By addressing both single- and multi-reflection IRS architectures, we examine their deployment strategies across diverse scenarios, including point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-area setups. For the single-reflection case, we highlight the trade-offs between passive and active IRS architectures in terms of beamforming gain, coverage extension, and spatial multiplexing. For the multi-reflection case, we discuss practical strategies to optimize IRS deployment and element allocation, balancing cooperative beamforming gains and path loss. The paper further discusses practical challenges in IRS implementation, including environmental conditions, system compatibility, and hardware limitations. Numerical results and field tests validate the effectiveness of IRS-aided wireless networks and demonstrate their capacity and coverage improvements. Lastly, promising research directions, including movable IRSs, near-field deployments, and network-level optimization, are outlined to guide future investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic machine-learning approach for classifying acute pain from raw electrophysiological signals. We address binary and ternary classification tasks, leveraging Power-In-Band (PIB) and signal coherence as distinguishing features. Our method evaluates the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms on a manually curated electrophysiological dataset obtained from intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), offering valuable insights into model performance for pain detection. Furthermore, we identify critical electrode pairings associated with acute pain, providing a clearer understanding of the neural markers that differentiate pain states. This work highlights the potential of targeted feature engineering in advancing pain classification, setting the stage for future enhancements in real-time and personalized pain assessment tools. Additionally, these findings have promising applications in neuromodulation and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), where adaptive and closed-loop systems could leverage identified pain markers to modulate pain-related brain regions more precisely, offering improved therapeutic options for chronic pain management</description>

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Vehicle-to-Vehicle Visible Light Communication in dynamic environments, focusing on the effects of speed, horizontal offset, and other factors on communication reliability. Using On-Off Keying modulation, we analyze the BER, optimal communication distance, correlation time and the maximum amount of data per communication. Our results demonstrate that maintaining an optimal vehicle distance is critical for stable communication, with speed and horizontal offset significantly influencing communication.

      <title>Simple Alternating Minimization Provably Solves Complete Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the noiseless complete dictionary learning problem, where the goal is to represent a set of given signals as linear combinations of a small number of atoms from a learned dictionary. There are two main challenges faced by theoretical and practical studies of dictionary learning: the lack of theoretical guarantees for practically-used heuristic algorithms and their poor scalability when dealing with huge-scale datasets. Towards addressing these issues, we propose a simple and efficient algorithm that provably recovers the ground truth when applied to the nonconvex and discrete formulation of the problem in the noiseless setting. We also extend our proposed method to mini-batch and online settings where the data is huge-scale or arrives continuously over time. At the core of our proposed method lies an efficient preconditioning technique that transforms the unknown dictionary to a near-orthonormal one, for which we prove a simple alternating minimization technique converges linearly to the ground truth under minimal conditions. Our numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets showcase the superiority of our method compared with the existing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Along with the prosperity of generative artificial intelligence (AI), its potential for solving conventional challenges in wireless communications has also surfaced. Inspired by this trend, we investigate the application of the advanced diffusion models (DMs), a representative class of generative AI models, to high dimensional wireless channel estimation. By capturing the structure of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels via a deep generative prior encoded by DMs, we develop a novel posterior inference method for channel reconstruction. We further adapt the proposed method to recover channel information from low-resolution quantized measurements. Additionally, to enhance the over-the-air viability, we integrate the DM with the unsupervised Stein's unbiased risk estimator to enable learning from noisy observations and circumvent the requirements for ground truth channel data that is hardly available in practice. Results reveal that the proposed estimator achieves high-fidelity channel recovery while reducing estimation latency by a factor of 10 compared to state-of-the-art schemes, facilitating real-time implementation. Moreover, our method outperforms existing estimators while reducing the pilot overhead by half, showcasing its scalability to ultra-massive antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>POMDP-Driven Cognitive Massive MIMO Radar: Joint Target Detection-Tracking In Unknown Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The joint detection and tracking of a moving target embedded in an unknown disturbance represents a key feature that motivates the development of the cognitive radar paradigm. Building upon recent advancements in robust target detection with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars, this work explores the application of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework to enhance the tracking and detection tasks in a statistically unknown environment. In the POMDP setup, the radar system is considered as an intelligent agent that continuously senses the surrounding environment, optimizing its actions to maximize the probability of detection $(P_D)$ and improve the target position and velocity estimation, all this while keeping a constant probability of false alarm $(P_{FA})$. The proposed approach employs an online algorithm that does not require any apriori knowledge of the noise statistics, and it relies on a much more general observation model than the traditional range-azimuth-elevation model employed by conventional tracking algorithms. Simulation results clearly show substantial performance improvement of the POMDP-based algorithm compared to the State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA)-based one that has been recently investigated in the context of massive MIMO (MMIMO) radar systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The monogenic signal (MS) was introduced by Felsberg and Sommer, and independently by Larkin under the name vortex operator. It is a two-dimensional (2D) analog of the well-known analytic signal, and allows for direct amplitude and phase demodulation of (amplitude and phase) modulated images so long as the signal is intrinsically one-dimensional (i1D). Felsberg's PhD dissertation also introduced the structure multivector (SMV), a model allowing for intrinsically 2D (i2D) structure. While the monogenic signal has become a well-known tool in the image processing community, the SMV is little used, although even in the case of i1D signals it provides a more robust orientation estimation than the MS. We argue the SMV is more suitable in standard i1D image feature extraction due to the this improvement, and extend the steerable wavelet frames of Held et al. to accommodate the additional features of the SMV. We then propose a novel quality map based on local orientation variance which values structurally coherent patches. This yields a multiscale phase estimate which performs well even when signal to noise ratio (SNR) is $\le$ 1. The performance is evaluated on several synthetic phase estimation tasks as well as on a fine-scale fingerprint registration task related to the 2D phase demodulation problem.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses, for the first time, the uplink performance optimization of multi-user pinching-antenna (PA) systems, recently developed for next-generation wireless networks. By leveraging the unique capabilities of PAs to dynamically configure wireless channels, we focus on maximizing the minimum achievable data rate between devices to achieve a balanced trade-off between throughput and fairness. An effective approach is proposed that separately optimizes the positions of the PAs and the resource allocation. The antenna positioning problem is reformulated into a convex one, while a closed-form solution is provided for the resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the investigated system using the proposed algorithm over corresponding counterparts, emphasizing the significant potential of PA systems for robust and efficient uplink communication in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionization chambers are essential for activity determinations in radionuclide metrology. We have developed a high-precision integrating-differentiating (int-diff) system for measuring small currents. It is anticipated to enhance the ionization current measurement capability of the 4{\pi}{\gamma} ionization chamber radioactivity standard at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China. Besides, it has broad application prospects in physical experiments and fundamental metrology. The design of the measurement system is optimized through circuit analysis and simulation. The structure of the integrating capacitor array is redesigned to reduce the error of the amplification gain, and a relay is used as the reset switch to achieve improved noise and leakage performance. The digital readout and control module is also enhanced in terms of flexibility and functionality. High-precision test platforms utilizing the standard small current source at NIM China and an ionization chamber were developed to evaluate the performance of the system. The results demonstrate an ultra-low noise floor (&lt;1 fA/\sqrt{Hz}) and a low current bias of fA-level, as well as a low temperature coefficient of the amplification gain of 2.1 ppm/{\textdegree}C. The short-term stability and linearity of the gain are also tested and exhibit comparable indicators to those of the Keithley 6430. Reasonable results are obtained in the long-term reproducibility test. Therefore, the system enables high-precision measurements for small direct currents and shows promise for applications in ionization chambers.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication with Flexible Reflector: Joint Placement and Rotation Optimization for Coverage Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Passive metal reflectors for communication enhancement have appealing advantages such as ultra low cost, zero energy expenditure, maintenance-free operation, long life span, and full compatibility with legacy wireless systems. To unleash the full potential of passive reflectors for wireless communications, this paper proposes a new passive reflector architecture, termed flexible reflector (FR), for enabling the flexible adjustment of beamforming direction via the FR placement and rotation optimization. We consider the multi-FR aided area coverage enhancement and aim to maximize the minimum expected receive power over all locations within the target coverage area, by jointly optimizing the placement positions and rotation angles of multiple FRs. To gain useful insights, the special case of movable reflector (MR) with fixed rotation is first studied to maximize the expected receive power at a target location, where the optimal single-MR placement positions for electrically large and small reflectors are derived in closed-form, respectively. It is shown that the reflector should be placed at the specular reflection point for electrically large reflector. While for area coverage enhancement, the optimal placement is obtained for the single-MR case and a sequential placement algorithm is proposed for the multi-MR case. Moreover, for the general case of FR, joint placement and rotation design is considered for the single-/multi-FR aided coverage enhancement, respectively. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate significant performance gains of FRs over various benchmark schemes under different practical setups in terms of receive power enhancement.</description>

Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The field analysis reveals Mie resonances as the physical reason behind the peaks. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.</description>
