      <title>U-Net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion Analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME) in particle-tracking data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biophysical processes within living systems rely on encounters and interactions between molecules in complex environments such as cells. They are often described by anomalous diffusion transport. Recent advances in single-molecule microscopy and particle-tracking techniques have yielded an abundance of data in the form of videos and trajectories that contain critical information about these biologically significant processes. However, standard approaches for characterizing anomalous diffusion from these measurements often struggle in cases of practical interest, e.g. due to short, noisy trajectories. Fully exploiting this data therefore requires the development of advanced analysis methods -- a core goal at the heart of the recent international Anomalous Diffusion Challenges. Here, we introduce a novel machine-learning framework, U-net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME), that applies a U-Net 3+ based neural network alongside Gaussian mixture models to enable highly accurate characterisation of single-particle tracking data. In the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge, U-AnD-ME outperformed all other participating methods for the analysis of two-dimensional anomalous diffusion trajectories at both single-trajectory and ensemble levels. Using a large dataset inspired by the Challenge, we further characterize the performance of U-AnD-ME in segmenting trajectories and inferring anomalous diffusion properties.</description>

      <title>Arctic teleconnection on climate and ozone pollution in the polar jet stream path of eastern US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arctic sea ice is in reduction and has been a key significant indicator of climate change. In this paper, we explore Arctic Sea ice extent data to identify teleconnection with weather change in the polar and sub-tropical jet stream intersection in eastern United States (US) and hence the potential influence in ground level ozone pollution. Several statistical methods including Bayesian techniques such as: spatio-temporal modelling and Bayesian network are implemented to identify the teleconnection and also validated based on theories in atmospheric science. We observe that the teleconnection is relatively strong in autumn, winter and spring seasons compared to the summer. Furthermore, the sudden decremental effect of Arctic sea-ice extent in mid-2000s has a shifting influence in ozone pollutions compared to the previous years. A similar downward shift in the Arctic sea-ice extent has been projected in 2030. These findings indicate to initiate further strategic policies for the Arctic influence, ozone concentrations together the seasonal and global changing patterns of climate.</description>

      <title>Estimating Nodal Spreading Influence Using Partial Temporal Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks, whose links are activated or deactivated over time, are used to represent complex systems such as social interactions or collaborations occurring at specific times. Such networks facilitate the spread of information and epidemics. The average number of nodes infected via a spreading process on a network starting from a single seed node over a given period is called the influence of that node. In this paper, we address the question of how to utilize the partially observed temporal network (local and of short duration) around each node, to estimate the ranking of nodes in spreading influence on the full network over a long period. This is essential for target marketing and epidemic/misinformation mitigation where only partial network information is possibly accessible. This would also enable us to understand which network properties of a node, observed locally and shortly after the start of the spreading process, determine its influence. We systematically propose a set of nodal centrality metrics based on partial temporal network information, encoding diverse properties of (time-respecting) walks. It is found that distinct centrality metrics perform the best in estimating nodal influence depending on the infection probability of the spreading process. For a broad range of the infection probability, a node tends to be influential if it can reach many distinct nodes via time-respecting walks and if these nodes can be reached early in time. We find and explain why the proposed metrics generally outperform classic centrality metrics derived from both full and partial temporal networks.</description>
