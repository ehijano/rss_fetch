      <title>Fence decompositions and cherry covers in non-binary phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reticulate evolution can be modelled using phylogenetic networks. Tree-based networks, which are one of the more general classes of phylogenetic networks, have recently gained eminence for its ability to represent evolutionary histories with an underlying tree structure. To better understand tree-based networks, numerous characterizations have been proposed, based on tree embeddings, matchings, and arc partitions. Here, we build a bridge between two arc partition characterizations, namely maximal fence decompositions and cherry covers. Results on cherry covers have been found for general phylogenetic networks. We first show that the number of cherry covers is the same as the number of support trees (underlying tree structure of tree-based networks) for a given semibinary network. Maximal fence decompositions have only been defined thus far for binary networks (constraints on vertex degrees). We remedy this by generalizing fence decompositions to non-binary networks, and using this, we characterize semi-binary tree-based networks in terms of forbidden structures. Furthermore, we give an explicit enumeration of cherry covers of semi-binary networks, by studying its fence decomposition. Finally, we prove that it is possible to characterize semi-binary tree-child networks, a subclass of tree-based networks, in terms of the number of their cherry covers.</description>

      <title>A stochastic population model with hierarchic size-structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a hierarchically structured population in which the amount of resources an individual has access to is affected by individuals that are larger, and that the intake of resources by an individual only affects directly the growth rate of the individual. We formulate a deterministic model, which takes the form of a delay equation for the population birth rate. We also formulate an individual based stochastic model, and study the relationship between the two models. In particular the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model is compared to that of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. Since the quasi-stationary birth rate cannot be obtained explicitly, we derive a formula to approximate it. We show that the stationary birth rate of the deterministic model can be obtained as the large population limit of the quasi-stationary birth rate of the stochastic model. This relation suggests that the deterministic model is a good approximation of the stochastic model when the number of individuals is sufficiently large.</description>
