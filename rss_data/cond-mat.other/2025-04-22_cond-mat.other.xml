      <title>Electronic stopping cross sections of tungsten to swift ions and comparisons with models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate stopping power data for tungsten is crucial for ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques applied to fusion-related materials. In this work, we present new experimental measurements of the stopping power of tungsten for protons and alpha particles, addressing key gaps in fundamental databases. Our results provide a densely spaced dataset, refining the practical uncertainty limits to approximately 1.5\% for protons and 4\% for alpha particles. We critically compare our findings with semi-empirical and theoretical models, evaluating their performance in describing the stopping power of tungsten for light projectiles. By improving the accuracy and reliability of stopping power data, we contribute to the enhancement of the applicability of ion-beam methods for characterizing tungsten in fusion-related research. These findings contribute to the refinement of semi-empirical models and support the ongoing efforts to develop more precise theoretical frameworks for ion-solid interactions in high-Z materials.</description>

      <title>Extending the Low-Frequency Limit of Time-Domain Thermoreflectance via Periodic Waveform Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) is a powerful technique for characterizing the thermal properties of layered materials. However, its effectiveness at modulation frequencies below 0.1 MHz is hindered by pulse accumulation effects, limiting its ability to accurately measure in-plane thermal conductivities below 6 W/(m K). Here, we present a periodic waveform analysis-based TDTR (PWA-TDTR) method that extends the measurable frequency range down to 50 Hz with minimal modifications to the conventional setup. This advancement greatly enhances measurement sensitivity, enabling accurate measurements of in-plane thermal conductivities as low as 0.2 W/(m K). We validate the technique by measuring polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and fused silica, using PWA-TDTR to obtain in-plane thermal diffusivity and conventional TDTR to measure cross-plane thermal effusivity. Together, these allow the extraction of both thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity, with results in excellent agreement with literature values. We further demonstrate the versatility of PWA-TDTR through (1) thermal conductivity and heat capacity measurements of thin liquid films and (2) depth-resolved thermal conductivity profiling in lithium niobate crystals, revealing point defect-induced inhomogeneities at depths up to 100 um. By overcoming frequency and sensitivity constraints, PWA-TDTR significantly expands the applicability of TDTR, enabling detailed investigations of thermal transport in materials and conditions that were previously challenging to study.</description>

      <title>Optimizations of electronic stopping cross section measurements using the backscattering method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of electronic stopping cross sections is essential for advancing nuclear science and materials research. In this work, we present an optimized methodology for stopping power measurements using the backscattering technique, with a focus on minimizing both random and systematic uncertainties. By systematically analyzing the sources of uncertainty and refining the experimental geometry, we establish a robust framework for high-precision measurements. Our approach was applied to the stopping power of helium ions in gold thin films, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference models such as SRIM and ICRU-49. The results reveal that carefully chosen measurement angles can effectively balance statistical precision and systematic accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3% across a wide energy range. This study provides a refined strategy for stopping power determination, offering valuable improvements for ion beam analysis and benchmarking theoretical models.</description>
