      <title>Deep learning velocity filtering for seismic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic velocity filtering is a critical technique in seismic exploration, designed to enhance the quality of effective signals by suppressing or eliminating interference waves. Traditional transform-domain methods, such as frequency-wavenumber (f-k) filtering and Radon transform filtering, often introduce aliasing and artifacts, while time-domain filtering algorithms may oversmooth effective signals. Although deep learning-based velocity filtering has yet to be directly applied in practical seismic processing, studies have demonstrated its potential in specific tasks, such as linear noise attenuation and VSP wavefield separation. However, the limited functionality of existing models poses challenges in addressing diverse velocity filtering tasks. To tackle this issue, We develop a deep learning velocity filtering algorithm based on upgoing and downgoing wave separation. By employing linear transformation, problems associated with arbitrary velocity differences are transformed in terms of upgoing and downgoing wave separation tasks. A diverse training dataset was constructed, comprising 31 theoretical velocity models, over 200 forward modeling simulations, and 46 field seismic datasets. The model trained on this dataset, combined with the proposed linear transformation strategy, achieves results comparable to traditional f-k and Radon filtering while also supporting tasks such as median filtering through manual wavefield picking. Applications in VSP upgoing and downgoing wavefield separation, distributed acoustic sensor (DAS) VSP P- and S-wave separation, post-stack migration arc noise mitigation, DAS common mode noise attenuation, and pre-stack CDP gather optimization demonstrate the method's versatility and practicality. This approach offers a novel and effective solution for almost all velocity filtering tasks in seismic data processing.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Roughness of Upper Mantle Discontinuities Inferred from the USArray: Dependence on Tomography Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used 3D plane wave migration to image topography of the upper mantle discontinuities at 410 km and 660 km depth that defines the transition zone. We find both discontinuities have topography variation at all resolvable scales. In this paper we examine the dependency of discontinuity roughness on tomography models. We migrated a common USArray data set with a selection of regional, global, surface wave, and body wave tomography models to distinguish different scales of roughness. The objective is to appraise what features are potential artifact from using an inaccurate velocity model. We find that the largest-scale features depend on the choice of tomography model, while smaller-scale features appear to be almost completely independent of current generation models. We suggest that this observation is additional evidence of the existence of small-scale roughness on the upper mantle discontinuities not captured with the data sampling density of the USArray. We find all models based only on body wave travel times alone do not remove a continent scale offset of both discontinuities that correlates with the edge of the craton. We conclude that offset is an artifact linked to underestimation of wave speed in the upper mantle by pure body wave models. Models produced by joint inversion with surface wave dispersion data are less prone to this apparent artifact. The large-scale topography variation is consistent with rigid plate motion models of the subducted Farallon slab underneath North American. Smaller scale topography is found to have larger variation in regions where the vertical mantle flow through the transition zone is implied by transition zone thickness.</description>

      <title>Identifying the approach of a major earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19431v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing the seismicity in natural time and studying the evolution of the fluctuations of the entropy change of seismicity under time reversal for various scales of different length i (number of events), we can identify the approach of a major earthquake (EQ) occurrence. The current investigation is extended from 1984 until 2025 for the seismicity in Japan.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary complexion transitions in olivine with temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Olivine comprises approximately 70 $\%$ by volume of the Earth's upper mantle, making it likely that it controls the mechanical, electrical and seismic properties of the upper mantle. All rocks are composed of crystals separated by grain boundaries, which affect their overall conductivity, strength and viscosity. Here, we present a study of forsterite (Mg$_{2}$SiO$_{4}$) polycrystals synthesised between 1150 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C to obtain samples with different grain sizes. The grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) were analysed by SEM and EBSD. A reversible change in the GBPD is observed between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. The GBPD shows that the most commonly occurring grain boundary planes are {0kl}-type at 1290 $^{\circ}$C and below, while at 1390 $^{\circ}$C, (010) grain boundary planes dominate the average crystal habitus. The least common planes at all temperatures are (100). This reversible transition in the dominant grain boundary plane type is evidence for a temperature-dependent complexion transition occurring between 1290 $^{\circ}$C and 1390 $^{\circ}$C. It is well established that different grain boundary crystallographies are related to different grain boundary properties. We relate the observed grain boundary complexion transition to differences in grain boundary properties observed in previous studies and suggest their influence on bulk rock properties.</description>

      <title>GeoFlood: Computational model for overland flooding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents GeoFlood, a new open-source software package for solving the shallow-water equations (SWE) on a quadtree hierarchy of mapped, logically Cartesian grids managed by the parallel, adaptive library ForestClaw (Calhoun and Burstedde, 2017). The GeoFlood model is validated using standard benchmark tests from Neelz and Pender (2013) as well as the historical Malpasset dam failure. The benchmark test results are compared against those obtained from GeoClaw (Clawpack Development Team, 2020) and the software package HEC-RAS (Hydraulic Engineering Center River Analysis System, Army Corps of Engineers) (Brunner, 2018). The Malpasset outburst flood results are compared with those presented in George (2011) (obtained from the GeoClaw software), model results from Hervouet and Petitjean (1999), and empirical data. The comparisons validate GeoFlood's capabilities for idealized benchmarks compared to other commonly used models as well as its ability to efficiently simulate highly dynamic floods in complex terrain, consistent with historical field data. Because it is massively parallel and scalable, GeoFlood may be a valuable tool for efficiently computing large-scale flooding problems at very high resolutions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate- and state-dependent, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</description>
