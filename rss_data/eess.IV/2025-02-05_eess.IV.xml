      <title>Entropy-based measure of rock sample heterogeneity derived from micro-CT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an automated method for objectively measuring rock heterogeneity via raw X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional methods, which are time-consuming, costly, and subjective. Unlike approaches that rely on image segmentation, the proposed method processes micro-CT images directly, identifying textural heterogeneity. The image is partitioned into subvolumes, where attributes are calculated for each one, with entropy serving as a measure of uncertainty. This method adapts to varying sample characteristics and enables meaningful comparisons across distinct sets of samples. It was applied to a dataset consisting of 4,935 images of cylindrical plug samples derived from Brazilian reservoirs. The results showed that the selected attributes play a key role in producing desirable outcomes, such as strong correlations with structural heterogeneity. To assess the effectiveness of our method, we used evaluations provided by four experts who classified 175 samples as either heterogeneous or homogeneous, where each expert assessed a different number of samples. One of the presented attributes demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the homogeneous and heterogeneous samples labelled by all the experts, whereas the other two attributes yielded nonsignificant differences for three out of the four experts. The method was shown to better align with the expert choices than traditional textural attributes known for extracting heterogeneous properties from images. This textural heterogeneity measure provides an additional parameter that can assist in rock characterization, and the automated approach ensures easy reproduction and high cost-effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Brain Tumor Classification with Lightweight CNN Architecture: A Novel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumor classification using MRI images is critical in medical diagnostics, where early and accurate detection significantly impacts patient outcomes. While recent advancements in deep learning (DL), particularly CNNs, have shown promise, many models struggle with balancing accuracy and computational efficiency and often lack robustness across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture integrating separable convolutions and squeeze and excitation (SE) blocks, designed to enhance feature extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. Our model further incorporates batch normalization and dropout to prevent overfitting, ensuring stable and reliable performance. The proposed model is lightweight because it uses separable convolutions, which reduce the number of parameters, and incorporates global average pooling instead of fully connected layers to minimize computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. Our model does better than other models by about 0.5% to 1.0% in accuracy and 1.5% to 2.5% in loss reduction, as shown by many experiments. It has a validation accuracy of 99.22% and a test accuracy of 98.44%. These results highlight the model's ability to generalize effectively across different brain tumour types, offering a robust tools for clinical applications. Our work sets a new benchmark in the field, providing a foundation for future research in optimizing the accuracy and efficiency of DL models for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Sparse Measurement Medical CT Reconstruction using Multi-Fused Block Matching Denoising Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge for medical X-ray CT imaging is reducing the number of X-ray projections to lower radiation dosage and reduce scan times without compromising image quality. However these under-determined inverse imaging problems rely on the formulation of an expressive prior model to constrain the solution space while remaining computationally tractable. Traditional analytical reconstruction methods like Filtered Back Projection (FBP) often fail with sparse measurements, producing artifacts due to their reliance on the Shannon-Nyquist Sampling Theorem. Consensus Equilibrium, which is a generalization of Plug and Play, is a recent advancement in Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR), has facilitated the use of multiple denoisers are prior models in an optimization free framework to capture complex, non-linear prior information. However, 3D prior modelling in a Plug and Play approach for volumetric image reconstruction requires long processing time due to high computing requirement.
  Instead of directly using a 3D prior, this work proposes a BM3D Multi Slice Fusion (BM3D-MSF) prior that uses multiple 2D image denoisers fused to act as a fully 3D prior model in Plug and Play reconstruction approach. Our approach does not require training and are thus able to circumvent ethical issues related with patient training data and are readily deployable in varying noise and measurement sparsity levels. In addition, reconstruction with the BM3D-MSF prior achieves similar reconstruction image quality as fully 3D image priors, but with significantly reduced computational complexity. We test our method on clinical CT data and demonstrate that our approach improves reconstructed image quality.</description>

      <title>Layer Separation: Adjustable Joint Space Width Images Synthesis in Conventional Radiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation and progressive structural damage. Joint space width (JSW) is a critical indicator in conventional radiography for evaluating disease progression, which has become a prominent research topic in computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems. However, deep learning-based radiological CAD systems for JSW analysis face significant challenges in data quality, including data imbalance, limited variety, and annotation difficulties. This work introduced a challenging image synthesis scenario and proposed Layer Separation Networks (LSN) to accurately separate the soft tissue layer, the upper bone layer, and the lower bone layer in conventional radiographs of finger joints. Using these layers, the adjustable JSW images can be synthesized to address data quality challenges and achieve ground truth (GT) generation. Experimental results demonstrated that LSN-based synthetic images closely resemble real radiographs, and significantly enhanced the performance in downstream tasks. The code and dataset will be available.</description>

      <title>ReMiDi: Reconstruction of Microstructure Using a Differentiable Diffusion MRI Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ReMiDi, a novel method for inferring neuronal microstructure as arbitrary 3D meshes using a differentiable diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) simulator. We first implemented in PyTorch a differentiable dMRI simulator that simulates the forward diffusion process using a finite-element method on an input 3D microstructure mesh. To achieve significantly faster simulations, we solve the differential equation semi-analytically using a matrix formalism approach. Given a reference dMRI signal $S_{ref}$, we use the differentiable simulator to iteratively update the input mesh such that it matches $S_{ref}$ using gradient-based learning. Since directly optimizing the 3D coordinates of the vertices is challenging, particularly due to ill-posedness of the inverse problem, we instead optimize a lower-dimensional latent space representation of the mesh. The mesh is first encoded into spectral coefficients, which are further encoded into a latent $\textbf{z}$ using an auto-encoder, and are then decoded back into the true mesh. We present an end-to-end differentiable pipeline that simulates signals that can be tuned to match a reference signal by iteratively updating the latent representation $\textbf{z}$. We demonstrate the ability to reconstruct microstructures of arbitrary shapes represented by finite-element meshes, with a focus on axonal geometries found in the brain white matter, including bending, fanning and beading fibers. Our source code will be made available online.</description>

      <title>UD-Mamba: A pixel-level uncertainty-driven Mamba model for medical image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have highlighted the Mamba framework, a state-space model known for its efficiency in capturing long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. While Mamba has shown competitive performance in medical image segmentation, it encounters difficulties in modeling local features due to the sporadic nature of traditional location-based scanning methods and the complex, ambiguous boundaries often present in medical images. To overcome these challenges, we propose Uncertainty-Driven Mamba (UD-Mamba), which redefines the pixel-order scanning process by incorporating channel uncertainty into the scanning mechanism. UD-Mamba introduces two key scanning techniques: 1) sequential scanning, which prioritizes regions with high uncertainty by scanning in a row-by-row fashion, and 2) skip scanning, which processes columns vertically, moving from high-to-low or low-to-high uncertainty at fixed intervals. Sequential scanning efficiently clusters high-uncertainty regions, such as boundaries and foreground objects, to improve segmentation precision, while skip scanning enhances the interaction between background and foreground regions, allowing for timely integration of background information to support more accurate foreground inference. Recognizing the advantages of scanning from certain to uncertain areas, we introduce four learnable parameters to balance the importance of features extracted from different scanning methods. Additionally, a cosine consistency loss is employed to mitigate the drawbacks of transitioning between uncertain and certain regions during the scanning process. Our method demonstrates robust segmentation performance, validated across three distinct medical imaging datasets involving pathology, dermatological lesions, and cardiac tasks.</description>

      <title>Deep Ensemble approach for Enhancing Brain Tumor Segmentation in Resource-Limited Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors is a critical step in treatment planning, yet manual segmentation is both time-consuming and subjective, relying heavily on the expertise of radiologists. In Sub-Saharan Africa, this challenge is magnified by overburdened medical systems and limited access to advanced imaging modalities and expert radiologists. Automating brain tumor segmentation using deep learning offers a promising solution. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), especially the U-Net architecture, have shown significant potential. However, a major challenge remains: achieving generalizability across different datasets. This study addresses this gap by developing a deep learning ensemble that integrates UNet3D, V-Net, and MSA-VNet models for the semantic segmentation of gliomas. By initially training on the BraTS-GLI dataset and fine-tuning with the BraTS-SSA dataset, we enhance model performance. Our ensemble approach significantly outperforms individual models, achieving DICE scores of 0.8358 for Tumor Core, 0.8521 for Whole Tumor, and 0.8167 for Enhancing Tumor. These results underscore the potential of ensemble methods in improving the accuracy and reliability of automated brain tumor segmentation, particularly in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Test Time Training for 4D Medical Image Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D medical image interpolation is essential for improving temporal resolution and diagnostic precision in clinical applications. Previous works ignore the problem of distribution shifts, resulting in poor generalization under different distribution. A natural solution would be to adapt the model to a new test distribution, but this cannot be done if the test input comes without a ground truth label. In this paper, we propose a novel test time training framework which uses self-supervision to adapt the model to a new distribution without requiring any labels. Indeed, before performing frame interpolation on each test video, the model is trained on the same instance using a self-supervised task, such as rotation prediction or image reconstruction. We conduct experiments on two publicly available 4D medical image interpolation datasets, Cardiac and 4D-Lung. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant performance across various evaluation metrics on both datasets. It achieves higher peak signal-to-noise ratio values, 33.73dB on Cardiac and 34.02dB on 4D-Lung. Our method not only advances 4D medical image interpolation but also provides a template for domain adaptation in other fields such as image segmentation and image registration.</description>

      <title>Style transfer as data augmentation: evaluating unpaired image-to-image translation models in mammography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several studies indicate that deep learning models can learn to detect breast cancer from mammograms (X-ray images of the breasts). However, challenges with overfitting and poor generalisability prevent their routine use in the clinic. Models trained on data from one patient population may not perform well on another due to differences in their data domains, emerging due to variations in scanning technology or patient characteristics. Data augmentation techniques can be used to improve generalisability by expanding the diversity of feature representations in the training data by altering existing examples. Image-to-image translation models are one approach capable of imposing the characteristic feature representations (i.e. style) of images from one dataset onto another. However, evaluating model performance is non-trivial, particularly in the absence of ground truths (a common reality in medical imaging). Here, we describe some key aspects that should be considered when evaluating style transfer algorithms, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of popular metrics, and important factors to be mindful of when implementing them in practice. We consider two types of generative models: a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) and a diffusion-based SynDiff model. We learn unpaired image-to-image translation across three mammography datasets. We highlight that undesirable aspects of model performance may determine the suitability of some metrics, and also provide some analysis indicating the extent to which various metrics assess unique aspects of model performance. We emphasise the need to use several metrics for a comprehensive assessment of model performance.</description>

      <title>The Skin Game: Revolutionizing Standards for AI Dermatology Model Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning approaches in dermatological image classification have shown promising results, yet the field faces significant methodological challenges that impede proper evaluation. This paper presents a dual contribution: first, a systematic analysis of current methodological practices in skin disease classification research, revealing substantial inconsistencies in data preparation, augmentation strategies, and performance reporting; second, a comprehensive training and evaluation framework demonstrated through experiments with the DINOv2-Large vision transformer across three benchmark datasets (HAM10000, DermNet, ISIC Atlas). The analysis identifies concerning patterns, including pre-split data augmentation and validation-based reporting, potentially leading to overestimated metrics, while highlighting the lack of unified methodology standards. The experimental results demonstrate DINOv2's performance in skin disease classification, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.85 (HAM10000), 0.71 (DermNet), and 0.84 (ISIC Atlas). Attention map analysis reveals critical patterns in the model's decision-making, showing sophisticated feature recognition in typical presentations but significant vulnerabilities with atypical cases and composite images. Our findings highlight the need for standardized evaluation protocols and careful implementation strategies in clinical settings. We propose comprehensive methodological recommendations for model development, evaluation, and clinical deployment, emphasizing rigorous data preparation, systematic error analysis, and specialized protocols for different image types. To promote reproducibility, we provide our implementation code through GitHub. This work establishes a foundation for rigorous evaluation standards in dermatological image classification and provides insights for responsible AI implementation in clinical dermatology.</description>

      <title>AAD-DCE: An Aggregated Multimodal Attention Mechanism for Early and Late Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Prostate MRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02555v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is a medical imaging technique that plays a crucial role in the detailed visualization and identification of tissue perfusion in abnormal lesions and radiological suggestions for biopsy. However, DCE-MRI involves the administration of a Gadolinium based (Gad) contrast agent, which is associated with a risk of toxicity in the body. Previous deep learning approaches that synthesize DCE-MR images employ unimodal non-contrast or low-dose contrast MRI images lacking focus on the local perfusion information within the anatomy of interest. We propose AAD-DCE, a generative adversarial network (GAN) with an aggregated attention discriminator module consisting of global and local discriminators. The discriminators provide a spatial embedded attention map to drive the generator to synthesize early and late response DCE-MRI images. Our method employs multimodal inputs - T2 weighted (T2W), Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), and T1 pre-contrast for image synthesis. Extensive comparative and ablation studies on the ProstateX dataset show that our model (i) is agnostic to various generator benchmarks and (ii) outperforms other DCE-MRI synthesis approaches with improvement margins of +0.64 dB PSNR, +0.0518 SSIM, -0.015 MAE for early response and +0.1 dB PSNR, +0.0424 SSIM, -0.021 MAE for late response, and (ii) emphasize the importance of attention ensembling.

      <title>Hamming Attention Distillation: Binarizing Keys and Queries for Efficient Long-Context Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained transformer models with extended context windows are notoriously expensive to run at scale, often limiting real-world deployment due to their high computational and memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce Hamming Attention Distillation (HAD), a novel framework that binarizes keys and queries in the attention mechanism to achieve significant efficiency gains. By converting keys and queries into {-1, +1} vectors and replacing dot-product operations with efficient Hamming distance computations, our method drastically reduces computational overhead. Additionally, we incorporate attention matrix sparsification to prune low-impact activations, which further reduces the cost of processing long-context sequences. \par Despite these aggressive compression strategies, our distilled approach preserves a high degree of representational power, leading to substantially improved accuracy compared to prior transformer binarization methods. We evaluate HAD on a range of tasks and models, including the GLUE benchmark, ImageNet, and QuALITY, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among binarized Transformers while drastically reducing the computational costs of long-context inference. \par We implement HAD in custom hardware simulations, demonstrating superior performance characteristics compared to a custom hardware implementation of standard attention. HAD achieves just $\mathbf{1.78}\%$ performance losses on GLUE compared to $9.08\%$ in state-of-the-art binarization work, and $\mathbf{2.5}\%$ performance losses on ImageNet compared to $12.14\%$, all while targeting custom hardware with a $\mathbf{79}\%$ area reduction and $\mathbf{87}\%$ power reduction compared to its standard attention counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new ensemble framework for boosting the performance of overparameterized unfolding networks solving the compressed sensing problem. We combine a state-of-the-art overparameterized unfolding network with a continuation technique, to warm-start a crucial quantity of the said network's architecture; we coin the resulting continued network C-DEC. Moreover, for training and evaluating C-DEC, we incorporate the log-cosh loss function, which enjoys both linear and quadratic behavior. Finally, we numerically assess C-DEC's performance on real-world images. Results showcase that the combination of continuation with the overparameterized unfolded architecture, trained and evaluated with the chosen loss function, yields smoother loss landscapes and improved reconstruction and generalization performance of C-DEC, consistently for all datasets.</description>

      <title>A Privacy-Preserving Domain Adversarial Federated learning for multi-site brain functional connectivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and its derived functional connectivity networks (FCNs) have become critical for understanding neurological disorders. However, collaborative analyses and the generalizability of models still face significant challenges due to privacy regulations and the non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) property of multiple data sources. To mitigate these difficulties, we propose Domain Adversarial Federated Learning (DAFed), a novel federated deep learning framework specifically designed for non-IID fMRI data analysis in multi-site settings. DAFed addresses these challenges through feature disentanglement, decomposing the latent feature space into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, to ensure robust global learning while preserving local data specificity. Furthermore, adversarial training facilitates effective knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled datasets, while a contrastive learning module enhances the global representation of domain-invariant features. We evaluated DAFed on the diagnosis of ASD and further validated its generalizability in the classification of AD, demonstrating its superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an enhanced Score-CAM module identifies key brain regions and functional connectivity significantly associated with ASD and MCI, respectively, uncovering shared neurobiological patterns across sites. These findings highlight the potential of DAFed to advance multi-site collaborative research in neuroimaging while protecting data confidentiality.</description>

      <title>Toward a Low-Cost Perception System in Autonomous Vehicles: A Spectrum Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a cost-effective new approach for generating denser depth maps for Autonomous Driving (AD) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by integrating the images obtained from deep neural network (DNN) 4D radar detectors with conventional camera RGB images. Our approach introduces a novel pixel positional encoding algorithm inspired by Bartlett's spatial spectrum estimation technique. This algorithm transforms both radar depth maps and RGB images into a unified pixel image subspace called the Spatial Spectrum, facilitating effective learning based on their similarities and differences. Our method effectively leverages high-resolution camera images to train radar depth map generative models, addressing the limitations of conventional radar detectors in complex vehicular environments, thus sharpening the radar output. We develop spectrum estimation algorithms tailored for radar depth maps and RGB images, a comprehensive training framework for data-driven generative models, and a camera-radar deployment scheme for AV operation. Our results demonstrate that our approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 27.95% in terms of Unidirectional Chamfer Distance (UCD).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification presents challenges due to spectral redundancy and complex spatial-spectral dependencies. This paper proposes a novel framework, DCT-Mamba3D, for hyperspectral image classification. DCT-Mamba3D incorporates: (1) a 3D spectral-spatial decorrelation module that applies 3D discrete cosine transform basis functions to reduce both spectral and spatial redundancy, enhancing feature clarity across dimensions; (2) a 3D-Mamba module that leverages a bidirectional state-space model to capture intricate spatial-spectral dependencies; and (3) a global residual enhancement module that stabilizes feature representation, improving robustness and convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our DCT-Mamba3D outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in challenging scenarios such as the same object in different spectra and different objects in the same spectra.</description>

      <title>Multi-illuminant Color Constancy via Multi-scale Illuminant Estimation and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-illuminant color constancy methods aim to eliminate local color casts within an image through pixel-wise illuminant estimation. Existing methods mainly employ deep learning to establish a direct mapping between an image and its illumination map, which neglects the impact of image scales. To alleviate this problem, we represent an illuminant map as the linear combination of components estimated from multi-scale images. Furthermore, we propose a tri-branch convolution networks to estimate multi-grained illuminant distribution maps from multi-scale images. These multi-grained illuminant maps are merged adaptively with an attentional illuminant fusion module. Through comprehensive experimental analysis and evaluation, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and it has achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Improving Power Plant CO2 Emission Estimation with Deep Learning and Satellite/Simulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CO2 emissions from power plants, as significant super emitters, contribute substantially to global warming. Accurate quantification of these emissions is crucial for effective climate mitigation strategies. While satellite-based plume inversion offers a promising approach, challenges arise from data limitations and the complexity of atmospheric conditions. This study addresses these challenges by (a) expanding the available dataset through the integration of NO2 data from Sentinel-5P, generating continuous XCO2 maps, and incorporating real satellite observations from OCO-2/3 for over 71 power plants in data-scarce regions; and (b) employing a customized U-Net model capable of handling diverse spatio-temporal resolutions for emission rate estimation. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in emission rate accuracy compared to previous methods. By leveraging this enhanced approach, we can enable near real-time, precise quantification of major CO2 emission sources, supporting environmental protection initiatives and informing regulatory frameworks.</description>

      <title>DeepForest: Sensing Into Self-Occluding Volumes of Vegetation With Aerial Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to below-canopy volumetric vegetation data is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics. We address the long-standing limitation of remote sensing to penetrate deep into dense canopy layers. LiDAR and radar are currently considered the primary options for measuring 3D vegetation structures, while cameras can only extract the reflectance and depth of top layers. Using conventional, high-resolution aerial images, our approach allows sensing deep into self-occluding vegetation volumes, such as forests. It is similar in spirit to the imaging process of wide-field microscopy, but can handle much larger scales and strong occlusion. We scan focal stacks by synthetic-aperture imaging with drones and reduce out-of-focus signal contributions using pre-trained 3D convolutional neural networks. The resulting volumetric reflectance stacks contain low-frequency representations of the vegetation volume. Combining multiple reflectance stacks from various spectral channels provides insights into plant health, growth, and environmental conditions throughout the entire vegetation volume.</description>

      <title>Event-aided Semantic Scene Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on robust 3D scene understanding. Recent advances in Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) for autonomous driving underscore the limitations of RGB-based approaches, which struggle under motion blur, poor lighting, and adverse weather. Event cameras, offering high dynamic range and low latency, address these challenges by providing asynchronous data that complements RGB inputs. We present DSEC-SSC, the first real-world benchmark specifically designed for event-aided SSC, which includes a novel 4D labeling pipeline for generating dense, visibility-aware labels that adapt dynamically to object motion. Our proposed RGB-Event fusion framework, EvSSC, introduces an Event-aided Lifting Module (ELM) that effectively bridges 2D RGB-Event features to 3D space, enhancing view transformation and the robustness of 3D volume construction across SSC models. Extensive experiments on DSEC-SSC and simulated SemanticKITTI-E demonstrate that EvSSC is adaptable to both transformer-based and LSS-based SSC architectures. Notably, evaluations on SemanticKITTI-C demonstrate that EvSSC achieves consistently improved prediction accuracy across five degradation modes and both In-domain and Out-of-domain settings, achieving up to a 52.5% relative improvement in mIoU when the image sensor partially fails. Additionally, we quantitatively and qualitatively validate the superiority of EvSSC under motion blur and extreme weather conditions, where autonomous driving is challenged. The established datasets and our codebase will be made publicly at https://github.com/Pandapan01/EvSSC.</description>

      <title>Boundary Constraint-free Biomechanical Model-Based Surface Matching for Intraoperative Liver Deformation Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In image-guided liver surgery, 3D-3D non-rigid registration methods play a crucial role in estimating the mapping between the preoperative model and the intraoperative surface represented as point clouds, addressing the challenge of tissue deformation. Typically, these methods incorporate a biomechanical model, represented as a finite element model (FEM), used to regularize a surface matching term. This paper introduces a novel 3D-3D non-rigid registration method. In contrast to the preceding techniques, our method uniquely incorporates the FEM within the surface matching term itself, ensuring that the estimated deformation maintains geometric consistency throughout the registration process. Additionally, we eliminate the need to determine zero-boundary conditions and applied force locations in the FEM. We achieve this by integrating soft springs into the stiffness matrix and allowing forces to be distributed across the entire liver surface. To further improve robustness, we introduce a regularization technique focused on the gradient of the force magnitudes. This regularization imposes spatial smoothness and helps prevent the overfitting of irregular noise in intraoperative data. Optimization is achieved through an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm, further enhanced by our proposed method for determining the optimal step size. Our method is evaluated and compared to both a learning-based method and a traditional method that features FEM regularization using data collected on our custom-developed phantom, as well as two publicly available datasets. Our method consistently outperforms or is comparable to the baseline techniques. Our code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/zixinyang9109/BCF-FEM.</description>

      <title>Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have surfaced as a revolutionary element within the domain of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging, providing an advanced resolution to the enduring issue of reconciling radiation exposure with image quality. This comprehensive review synthesizes the rapid advancements in GAN-based LDCT denoising techniques, examining the evolution from foundational architectures to state-of-the-art models incorporating advanced features such as anatomical priors, perceptual loss functions, and innovative regularization strategies. We critically analyze various GAN architectures, including conditional GANs (cGANs), CycleGANs, and Super-Resolution GANs (SRGANs), elucidating their unique strengths and limitations in the context of LDCT denoising. The evaluation provides both qualitative and quantitative results related to the improvements in performance in benchmark and clinical datasets with metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. After highlighting the positive results, we discuss some of the challenges preventing a wider clinical use, including the interpretability of the images generated by GANs, synthetic artifacts, and the need for clinically relevant metrics. The review concludes by highlighting the essential significance of GAN-based methodologies in the progression of precision medicine via tailored LDCT denoising models, underlining the transformative possibilities presented by artificial intelligence within contemporary radiological practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prostate cancer diagnosis remains challenging. Even when using MRI, radiologists exhibit low specificity and significant inter-observer variability, leading to potential delays or inaccuracies in identifying clinically significant cancers. This leads to numerous unnecessary biopsies and risks of missing clinically significant cancers. Here we present prostate vision contrastive network (ProViCNet), prostate organ-specific vision foundation models for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Trans-Rectal Ultrasound imaging (TRUS) for comprehensive cancer detection. ProViCNet was trained and validated using 4,401 patients across six institutions, as a prostate cancer detection model on radiology images relying on patch-level contrastive learning guided by biopsy confirmed radiologist annotations. ProViCNet demonstrated consistent performance across multiple internal and external validation cohorts with area under the receiver operating curve values ranging from 0.875 to 0.966, significantly outperforming radiologists in the reader study (0.907 versus 0.805, p&lt;0.001) for mpMRI, while achieving 0.670 to 0.740 for TRUS. We also integrated ProViCNet with standard PSA to develop a virtual screening test, and we showed that we can maintain the high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant cancers while more than doubling specificity from 15% to 38% (p&lt;0.001), thereby substantially reducing unnecessary biopsies. These findings highlight that ProViCNet's potential for enhancing prostate cancer diagnosis accuracy and reduce unnecessary biopsies, thereby optimizing diagnostic pathways.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

Abstract: \textbf{Objective:} Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, encompassing a prodromal stage known as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), where patients may either progress to AD or remain stable. The objective of the work was to capture structural and functional modulations of brain structure and function relying on multimodal MRI data and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, also in case of missing views, with the twofold goal of classifying AD patients versus healthy controls and detecting MCI converters. % in two distinct tasks, dealing with also missing data.\\ \textbf{Approach:} We propose a multimodal DL-based classification framework where a generative module employing Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks was introduced in the latent space for imputing missing data (a common issue of multimodal approaches). Explainable AI method was then used to extract input features' relevance allowing for post-hoc validation and enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. \textbf{Main results:} Experimental results on two tasks, AD detection and MCI conversion, showed that our framework reached competitive performance in the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of $0.926\pm0.02$ and $0.711\pm0.01$ in the two tasks, respectively. The interpretability analysis revealed gray matter modulations in cortical and subcortical brain areas typically associated with AD. Moreover, impairments in sensory-motor and visual resting state networks along the disease continuum, as well as genetic mutations defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified. \textbf{Significance:} Our integrative and interpretable DL approach shows promising performance for AD detection and MCI prediction while shedding light on important biological insights.</description>

Abstract: In generative modeling, tokenization simplifies complex data into compact, structured representations, creating a more efficient, learnable space. For high-dimensional visual data, it reduces redundancy and emphasizes key features for high-quality generation. Current visual tokenization methods rely on a traditional autoencoder framework, where the encoder compresses data into latent representations, and the decoder reconstructs the original input. In this work, we offer a new perspective by proposing denoising as decoding, shifting from single-step reconstruction to iterative refinement. Specifically, we replace the decoder with a diffusion process that iteratively refines noise to recover the original image, guided by the latents provided by the encoder. We evaluate our approach by assessing both reconstruction (rFID) and generation quality (FID), comparing it to state-of-the-art autoencoding approaches. By adopting iterative reconstruction through diffusion, our autoencoder, namely $\epsilon$-VAE, achieves high reconstruction quality, which in turn enhances downstream generation quality by 22% and provides 2.3$\times$ inference speedup. We hope this work offers new insights into integrating iterative generation and autoencoding for improved compression and generation.</description>
