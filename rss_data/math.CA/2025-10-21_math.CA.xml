      <title>Parallelepipeds of maximal facet area in ellipsoids, through prescribed boundary points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n : x^{\top}A^{-1}x=1\}$ be an $n$-dimensional ellipsoid with $A$ positive definite. Among all $n$-dimensional parallelepipeds inscribed in $E$ (all $2^n$ vertices on $\partial E$), we study (i) the total $(n-1)$-dimensional measure of the facets (`surface area'), and (ii) the total $1$-dimensional measure of the $1$-skeleton (`circumference' or total edge length). We prove that the sharp global bounds $$ S_{\max}(E)=2^{n}n^{-(n-2)/2}\sqrt{\det A}\;\sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(A^{-1})}, \qquad L_{\max}(E)=2^{n}\sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(A)}. $$ are attained by inscribed images of orthotopes in the unit sphere; we give another proof in dimension $n=2$, originally proved by Richard, and, for $n\geqslant 3$, we prove such a maximisation result in the principal-axis case. In that case, we provide a constructive diagonal equalisation argument that preserves the barycentric constraint.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Extensions on $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{N}$ and a Discrete Hilbert Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given boundary sequence $a=(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$, we construct harmonic extensions $U,V:\mathbb{Z}\times\ \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{R}$ that serve as discrete analogs of the Poisson and conjugate-Poisson integrals. The construction is characterized by: (i) discrete harmonicity with respect to a two-dimensional Laplacian, (ii) a Cauchy-Riemann system, and (iii) boundary values involving a discrete Hilbert transform: $U(n,0)=a_n,\;V(n,0)=(H_{\mathrm d}a)_n$. We compare $H_{\mathrm d}$ to the Riesz-Titchmarsh transform and prove weak-type $(1,1)$ and $\ell^{p}$ bounds for $p&gt;1$. We also extend the constructions to harmonic extensions on $\mathbb{Z}^s \times \mathbb{N}$. These results provide a discrete harmonic-analytic model analogous to the classical theory.</description>

      <title>Restricted Marstrand's projection theorem for general families of linear subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a refinement of Marstrand's projection theorem; more specifically, let $\Pi_t, t\in[0,1]$ be a family of $m$ dimensional subspaces of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $P_t:\mathbb{R}^4\mapsto \Pi_t$ be the orthogonal projections onto $\Pi_t$. We hope to determine the conditions on $\Pi_t$ under which, for any Borel $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $\dim_H P_t(A)=\min(m,\dim_H A)$ holds for almost every $t$. We propose a conjectured condition on $\Pi_t$ and provide partial progress towards its resolution. We first establish a version of the polynomial Wolff axiom, and then apply polynomial partitioning to derive a version of the $L^p$ Kakeya inequality. Finally, we use a discretization procedure to obtain the desired bound.</description>

      <title>Representations of rational numbers and Minkowski dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the representations of rational numbers via continued fraction, Egyptian fraction, and Engel fraction expansions. Given $m \in \mathbb{N}$, denote by $C_m, E_m, E_m^*$ the sets of rational numbers whose continued fraction, Egyptian fraction, and Engel fraction expansions have length $m$, respectively. We establish the Minkowski dimensions of these sets and apply the results to analyze the phase transition phenomenon and sumset-type problems for decreasing sequences.</description>

      <title>Joint upper Banach density, VC dimensions and Euclidean point configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two related quantities which generalize the concept of upper Banach density of a set, to two measurable subsets of the plane. The first of them allows us to generalize a classic result on sufficiently large distances realized in a set of positive upper density, to distances between points of two sets satisfying an appropriate density condition. The second one allows us to show that for all sufficiently large scales $t&gt;0$ and for a smooth, closed, centrally symmetric, planar curve $\Gamma$ which bounds a convex and compact region in the plane and is of non-vanishing curvature, the family consisting of portions of translates of $t\Gamma$ has the maximal possible Vapnik--Chervonenkis dimension.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Krall polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we exhibit and study a novel class of exceptional Krall orthogonal polynomials of Hermite type. This means that the polynomials in question are (i) orthogonal with respect to a Hermite-type weight; (ii) are the eigenfunctions of a higher-order differential operator; (iii) the degree sequence of the polynomial family in question is missing a finite number of degrees. Regarding the second point, unlike the known class of exceptional Hermite polynomials that satisfy a second-order eigenvalue equation, the polynomials we introduce here are not eigenfunctions of any 2nd order differential operator, but are for one of 4th order. Regarding the third point, our family does not include a polynomial of degree zero and consequently satisfies a 5th order recurrence relation instead of the classical 3-term relation.</description>

      <title>On a Class of Berndt-type Integrals and Related Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of special Berndt-type integral calculations where the integrand contains only hyperbolic cosine functions. The research approach proceeds as follows: Firstly, through contour integration methods, we transform the integral into a Ramanujan-type hyperbolic infinite series. Subsequently, we introduce a $\theta$-parameterized auxiliary function and apply the residue theorem from complex analysis to successfully simplify mixed-type denominators combining hyperbolic cosine and sine terms into a normalized Ramanujan-type hyperbolic infinite series with denominators containing only single hyperbolic function terms. For these simplified hyperbolic infinite series, we combine properties of Jacobi elliptic functions with composite analytical techniques involving Fourier series expansion and Maclaurin series expansion. This ultimately yields an explicit expression as a rational polynomial combination of $\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\pi^{-1/2}$. Notably, this work establishes a connection between the integral and Barnes multiple zeta functions, providing a novel research pathway for solving related problems.</description>

      <title>The impact of Schur multipliers in harmonic analysis and operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schur multipliers are basic linear maps on matrix algebras. Their close albeit still intriguing connection with Fourier multipliers establishes a powerful bridge between harmonic analysis and operator algebras. In this paper, we survey their growing impact over the past 15 years. Particular attention will be drawn to recent bounds on Schatten $p$-classes, with far-reaching applications in harmonic analysis on group von Neumann algebras and operator rigidity phenomena for higher-rank Lie groups and lattices. Key novelties arise from new insights into nonToeplitz Schur multipliers and unprecedented connections with highly singular operators from Euclidean harmonic analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09443v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the Jones factorization theorem and the Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem for matrix $\mathcal A_p$ weights. These results answer longstanding open questions in the study of matrix weights. The proof requires the development of the theory of convex-set valued functions and measurable seminorm functions. In particular, we define a convex-set valued version of the Hardy Littlewood maximal operator and construct an appropriate generalization of the Rubio de Francia iteration algorithm, which is central to the proof of both results in the scalar case.</description>

Abstract: We give a Jackson integral representation for Kajihara's $q$-hypergeometric series $W^{M,2}$. We construct a $q$-difference system that corresponds to this integral. This system is an extension of the variant of $q$-hypergeometric equation of degree three, defined by Hatano-Matsunawa-Sato-Takemura. We show that this system includes the $q$-Appell-Lauricella system as a degeneration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09985v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Riemannian symmetric spaces $X=G/K$ of noncompact type, we show that for all left $K$-invariant $f\in L^1(X)$, the functions $\|h_t\|_{L^p(X)}^{-1}(f\ast h_t-M_p(f)h_t)$ (with $h_t$ being the heat kernel of $X$) converges to zero in $L^p(X)$, $p\in [1,\infty]$, as $t\to\infty$, with the constant $M_p(f)$ depending only on $p$ and $f$. We also prove an analogous result for the fractional heat kernels $h_t^{\alpha}$, $\alpha\in (0,1)$. The above results have recently been proved for the important special cases $p=1$ and $\alpha= 1,\frac 12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11475v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that if $A$ is a Borel subset of the first Heisenberg group with $2&lt; \dim A &lt; 3$, then vertical projections of $A$ almost surely do not decrease the Hausdorff dimension of $A$, with respect to the Kor\'anyi metric. This resolves the problem in the remaining range $2 &lt; \dim A &lt; 3$. The proof relies on a variable coefficient local smoothing inequality.</description>

      <title>Generalized Jensen's inequality motivated from thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the work of P.T.Landsberg\cite{web1,web2} and S.S.Sidhu\cite{web3} by providing an inequality that has its main motivation from the laws of thermodynamics, in the form of a theorem which is quite useful in generating different inequalities such as the weighted AM-GM-HM inequality, the p-th power inequality , Jensen's inequality and many other inequalities.In this paper, we have not only given the thermodynamic motivation behind the inequality but we have given the required mathematical justification in the form of a straightforward rigorous proof using basic real analysis , which was not present in the works of Landsberg and Sidhu. In fact, the first statement of the theorem mathematically proves the uniqueness of the equilibrium temperature that is attained when n different bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact. The second statement of the theorem gives a mathematical proof of the fact that the process in which n bodies at different temperatures when brought in contact equilibriate to a common temperature is spontaneous,i.e., entropically favourable. Thus, this article motivates the students to come up with different mathematical results by observing the phenomena already existing in nature and also helps them to appreciate the conventional inequalities taught to them at the secondary school and undergraduate level by associating relevant physical phenomena with those inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator $M$ is bounded on the variable Lebesgue space $L^{p(\cdot)}(X,d,\mu)$, with $1&lt;p_-\le p_+&lt;\infty$, over an unbounded space of homogeneous type $(X,d,\mu)$ with a Borel-semiregular measure $\mu$, if and only if the averaging operators $T_\mathcal{Q}$ are bounded on $L^{p(\cdot)}(X,d,\mu)$ uniformly over all families $\mathcal{Q}$ of pairwise disjoint ``cubes'' from a Hyt\"onen--Kairema dyadic system on $X$. This extends Diening's well-known characterization of the boundedness of $M$ on $L^{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to the setting of spaces of homogeneous type, while also providing a slight refinement of the original result.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new vanishing subspaces of the homogeneous H\"{o}lder space $\dot{C}^{0,\omega}(X,Y)$ in the generality of a doubling modulus $\omega$ and normed spaces $X$ and $Y.$ For many couples $X,Y,$ we show these vanishing subspaces to completely characterize those H\"older functions that admit approximations, in the H\"{o}lder seminorm, by smooth, Lipschitz and boundedly supported functions. We present connections to bi-parameter harmonic analysis on the Euclidean space by providing applications to the compactness of the bi-commutator of two Calder\'on-Zygmund operators</description>

Abstract: Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $\deg(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
  \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
  \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
  cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.</description>
