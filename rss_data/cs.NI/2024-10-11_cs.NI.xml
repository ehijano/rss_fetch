      <title>Goal-oriented vessel detection with distributed computing in a LEO satellite constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) has traditionally involved the transmission of a large volume of raw data to map the Earth surface. This results in congestion to the satellite network and delays in the availability of the results, invalidating the approach for timing-sensitive applications. Instead, the computation resources at the satellites can be used as an edge layer for compressing the data and/or doing inferences. In this paper, we investigate satellite edge computing for vessel detection with a LEO satellite constellation. First, we distribute the computation and inference load among the neighbouring satellites of the one taking the images, based on the VHRShips data set and YOLOv8. This semantic and fragmented information is then routed to a remote ground monitor through the whole constellation. The average and peak Age of Information (AoI) are reformulated to measure the freshness of the aggregated information at the receiver in this image-capture scenario. We then dimension the network (number of orbital planes and satellites per orbital plane) for a given target age and covered area that quantify the level of achievement of the task. The results show that 20 orbital planes with 20 satellites are necessary to keep the peak AoI below 60 seconds with a compression ratio &gt; 23000, i.e., a size reduction of 99.996%, and for a approximately 100% probability of coverage.</description>

      <title>"It's Your Turn": A Novel Channel Contention Mechanism for Improving Wi-Fi's Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of Wi-Fi, i.e., the IEEE 802.11bn (aka Wi-Fi 8), is not only expected to increase its performance and provide extended capabilities but also aims to offer a reliable service. Given that one of the main sources of unreliability in IEEE 802.11 stems from the current distributed channel access, which is based on Listen-Before-Talk (LBT), the development of novel contention schemes gains importance for Wi-Fi 8 and beyond. In this paper, we propose a new channel contention mechanism, "It's Your Turn" (IYT), that extends the existing Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and aims at improving the reliability of distributed LBT by providing ordered device transmissions thanks to neighboring activity awareness. Using simulation results, we show that our mechanism strives to provide reliable performance by controlling the channel access delay. We prove the versatility of IYT against different topologies, coexistence with legacy devices, and increasing network densities.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Deep Neural Network-Based Receiver Under Varying Signal-To-Noise Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for interpreting neural networks, focusing on convolutional neural network-based receiver model. The method identifies which unit or units of the model contain most (or least) information about the channel parameter(s) of the interest, providing insights at both global and local levels -- with global explanations aggregating local ones. Experiments on link-level simulations demonstrate the method's effectiveness in identifying units that contribute most (and least) to signal-to-noise ratio processing. Although we focus on a radio receiver model, the method generalizes to other neural network architectures and applications, offering robust estimation even in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Edge-Assisted Cooperative Data Compression, Communications and Computing for UGV-Enhanced Warehouse Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the growing need for task-oriented communications in warehouse logistics, where traditional communication Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)-such as latency, reliability, and throughput-often do not fully meet task requirements. As the complexity of data flow management in large-scale device networks increases, there is also a pressing need for innovative cross-system designs that balance data compression, communication, and computation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented, edge-assisted framework for cooperative data compression, communication, and computing in Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)-enhanced warehouse logistics. In this framework, two UGVs collaborate to transport cargo, with control functions-navigation for the front UGV and following/conveyance for the rear UGV-offloaded to the edge server to accommodate their limited on-board computing resources. We develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based two-stage point cloud data compression algorithm that dynamically and collaboratively adjusts compression ratios according to task requirements, significantly reducing communication overhead. System-level simulations of our UGV logistics prototype demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential for swift real-world implementation.</description>
