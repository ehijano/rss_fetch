      <title>Discrepancy of Arithmetic Progressions in Boxes and Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial discrepancy of arithmetic progressions inside $[N] := \{1, \ldots, N\}$ is the smallest integer $D$ for which $[N]$ can be colored with two colors so that any arithmetic progression in $[N]$ contains at most $D$ more elements from one color class than the other. Bounding the discrepancy of such set systems is a classical problem in discrepancy theory. More recently, this problem was generalized to arithmetic progressions in grids like $[N]^d$ (Valk{\'o}) and $[N_1]\times \ldots \times [N_d]$ (Fox, Xu, and Zhou). In the latter setting, Fox, Xu, and Zhou gave upper and lower bounds on the discrepancy that match within a $\frac{\log |\Omega|}{\log \log |\Omega|}$ factor, where $\Omega := [N_1]\times \ldots \times [N_d]$ is the ground set. In this work, we use the connection between factorization norms and discrepancy to improve their upper bound to be within a $\sqrt{\log|\Omega|}$ factor from the lower bound. We also generalize Fox, Xu, and Zhou's lower bound, and our upper bounds to arithmetic progressions in arbitrary convex bodies.</description>

      <title>GraphOmni: A Comprehensive and Extendable Benchmark Framework for Large Language Models on Graph-theoretic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we presented GraphOmni, a comprehensive benchmark framework for systematically evaluating the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By analyzing critical dimensions, including graph types, serialization formats, and prompt schemes, we provided extensive insights into the strengths and limitations of current LLMs. Our empirical findings emphasize that no single serialization or prompting strategy consistently outperforms others. Motivated by these insights, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach that dynamically selects the best serialization-prompt pairings, resulting in significant accuracy improvements. GraphOmni's modular and extensible design establishes a robust foundation for future research, facilitating advancements toward general-purpose graph reasoning models.</description>

      <title>A note on distance-hereditary graphs whose complement is also distance-hereditary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distance-hereditary graphs are known to be the graphs that are totally decomposable for the split decomposition. We characterise distance-hereditary graphs whose complement is also distance-hereditary by their split decomposition and by their modular decomposition.</description>

      <title>An exact approach for the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "avoid - shift - improve" framework and the European Clean Vehicles Directive set the path for improving the efficiency and ultimately decarbonizing the transport sector. While electric buses have already been adopted in several cities, regional bus lines may pose additional challenges due to the potentially longer distances they have to travel. In this work, we model and solve the electric bus scheduling problem, lexicographically minimizing the size of the bus fleet, the number of charging stops, and the total energy consumed, to provide decision support for bus operators planning to replace their diesel-powered fleet with zero emission vehicles. We propose a graph representation which allows partial charging without explicitly relying on time variables and derive 3-index and 2-index mixed-integer linear programming formulations for the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem. While the 3-index model can be solved by an off-the-shelf solver directly, the 2-index model relies on an exponential number of constraints to ensure the correct depot pairing. These are separated in a cutting plane fashion. We propose a set of instances with up to 80 service trips to compare the two approaches, showing that, with a small number of depots, the compact 3-index model performs very well. However, as the number of depots increases the developed branch-and-cut algorithm proves to be of value. These findings not only offer algorithmic insights but the developed approaches also provide actionable guidance for transit agencies and operators, allowing to quantify trade-offs between fleet size, energy efficiency, and infrastructure needs under realistic operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Avoidability beyond paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of avoidable paths in graphs was introduced by Beisegel, Chudnovsky, Gurvich, Milani\v{c}, and Servatius in 2019 as a common generalization of avoidable vertices and simplicial paths. In 2020, Bonamy, Defrain, Hatzel, and Thiebaut proved that every graph containing an induced path of order $k$ also contains an avoidable induced path of the same order. They also asked whether one could generalize this result to other avoidable structures, leaving the notion of avoidability up to interpretation. In this paper we address this question: we specify the concept of avoidability for arbitrary graphs equipped with two terminal vertices. We provide both positive and negative results, some of which appear to be related to the recent work by Chudnovsky, Norin, Seymour, and Turcotte [arXiv:2301.13175].</description>

      <title>Growing Trees and Amoebas' Replications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An amoeba is a tree together with instructions how to iteratively grow trees by adding paths of a fixed length $\ell$. This paper analyses such a growth process. An amoeba is mortal if all versions of the process are finite, and it is immortal if they are all infinite. We obtain some necessary and some sufficient conditions for mortality. In particular, for growing caterpillars in the case $\ell=1$ we characterize mortal amoebas. We discuss variations of the mortality concept, conjecture that some of them are equivalent, and support this conjecture for $\ell\in\{1,2\}$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Antisymmetry of Twisted Graph Adjacency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a prime counting problem across the homology classes of a graph, presenting a graph-theoretical Dirichlet-type analogue of the prime number theorem. The main machinery we have developed and employed is a spectral antisymmetry theorem, revealing that the spectra of the twisted graph adjacency matrices have an antisymmetric distribution over the character group of the graph with a special character called the canonical character being an extremum. Additionally, we derive some trace formulas based on the twisted adjacency matrices as part of our analysis.</description>
