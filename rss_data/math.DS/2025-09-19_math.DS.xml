      <title>Boundedness of solutions of the first-order linear multidimensional difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the boundedness of solutions of the first order linear difference equation of the form $x_{n+1} = Ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ where $A$ is a square matrix with complex entries, sequence $\{y_{n}\}_{n\geq 1}$ and initial value $x_1$ are supposed to be known. Firstly, we discuss the one-dimensional case of this equation $x_{n+1} = ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ where $a$ is a complex number. In particular, we obtain the sufficient conditions for boundedness or unboundedness of the solutions in case $|a|=1$(the critical case) by considering the exponential sums of the forms $\sum y_{n}e(n\varphi)$ and $\sum e(f(n))$.
  Then we proceed to the investigation of the equation in the multidimensional case and reduce our problem to analysis of the spectrum and Jordan cells of matrix $A$. The problem is especially interesting when spectrum of $A$ contains eigenvalues $\lambda$ with $|\lambda|=1$. At the end of the article we obtain a theorem that reveals the connection between equations $x_{n+1} = ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ with $|a|=1$ and $x_{n+1} = Jx_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ with $J$ being a Jordan cell of an eigenvalue $\lambda$, $|\lambda|=1$.</description>

      <title>A local limit theorem for a random walk in an intermittent dynamical environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an extended dynamical system on the non-negative real line with piecewise linear non-uniformly expanding local dynamics. With a uniformly distributed initial state, the distribution of the successive states coincides with that of a random walk in an inhomogeneous environment. Under suitable conditions on the environment, we establish a central limit theorem and a (non-Gaussian) local limit theorem for the walk. Our approach builds on the work of Leskel\"a and Stenlund (Stochastic Process.\ Appl.\ 121(12), 2011), who analyzed a corresponding model with uniformly expanding local dynamics.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of the spacecraft transfer problem through overdetermined and continuity constraints based on the Theory of Functional Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a segmented approach for solving constrained orbit transfer problems. The segments are connected through continuity constraints under the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) mathematical framework that performs linear functional interpolation. This approach is further enhanced by a general vector formulation, from where the constrained functional is derived considering also a set of linear overdetermined constraints. Since we constrain vector instead of coordinates, this methodology allows to apply TFC to multiple and complex constraints composed by any types of nonlinear components included. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on Earth-to-Moon transfers, showing that this segmented approach achieves solutions with several orders of magnitude greater accuracy and efficiency in comparison with unsegmented orbit transfers.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithms for Bandit Learning in Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of pure exploration in matching markets under uncertain preferences, where the goal is to identify a stable matching with confidence parameter $\delta$ and minimal sample complexity. Agents learn preferences via stochastic rewards, with expected values indicating preferences. This finds use in labor market platforms like Upwork, where firms and freelancers must be matched quickly despite noisy observations and no prior knowledge, in a stable manner that prevents dissatisfaction. We consider markets with unique stable matching and establish information-theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity for (1) one-sided learning, where one side of the market knows its true preferences, and (2) two-sided learning, where both sides are uncertain. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm and prove that it asymptotically ($\delta\to 0$) matches the lower bound to a constant for one-sided learning. Using the insights from the lower bound, we extend our algorithm to the two-sided learning setting and provide experimental results showing that it closely matches the lower bound on sample complexity. Finally, using a system of ODEs, we characterize the idealized fluid path that our algorithm chases.</description>

      <title>Dynamical degrees of affine-triangular automorphisms in dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, let k be the affine n-space over an arbitrary field k. We show that dynamical degrees of affine-triangular automorphisms in dimension 4 are algebraic integers of degree not larger than 4. As a consequence, if char(k) is not equal to 2, then dynamical degrees of quadratic automorphisms in dimension 4 are algebraic integers of degree not larger than 4. We also explore some results in higher dimensions. These results partially give the affirmative answer to the Conjecture in DF21</description>

      <title>On simultaneously preperiodic points for one-parameter families of polynomials in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a field $L$ of characteristic $p$, a polynomial $f \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$ and $\alpha, \beta \in L$, let $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ be the set of all $\lambda \in \overline{L}$ such that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are preperiodic under the action of $f_{\lambda}(x) := f(x) + \lambda$. Ghioca and Hsia proved that for certain families of polynomials, this set is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. Building on their earlier work, we determine the condition that $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite for two classes of binomials that were left open. Specifically, let $f(x)=c_1 x^{d_1} + c_2 x^{d_2} \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p[x]$, where $c_i \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p^*$, $1 \le d_1 &lt; d_2$ and $d_i=p^{\ell_i}s_i$ with $\ell_i \ge 0$ and $p \nmid s_i$. We prove that if $p \nmid s_1-1$ or $s_2=1$, then $\mathrm{Prep}(f;\alpha,\beta)$ is infinite if and only if $f(\alpha)=f(\beta)$ or $\alpha, \beta \in \overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$. The key idea of the proof is to use the parameters $\lambda_{\overline{\alpha}} := \overline{\alpha} - f(\overline{\alpha})$ associated to suitable elements $\overline{\alpha} \in \overline{L}$ satisfying $f(\overline{\alpha})=f(\alpha)$.</description>

      <title>On the dimension distortion under fractionally smooth mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the extent to which continuous mappings in various Sobolev classes distort various dimensions, including the Hausdorff, the upper Minkowski (box-counting), and the upper intermediate dimensions. The intermediate and Minkowski dimension distortion results we obtain are novel already for various classes of fractionally smooth mappings between Euclidean spaces, extending the results of Hencl-Honz\'ik (2015) and Huynh (2022) to these dimensions. In addition, our work also generalizes the aforementioned results, as well as results of Kaufman (2000) and Fraser-Tyson (2025), to certain weighted Euclidean spaces and, more generally, to doubling metric measure spaces. As an application of our main result, we quantify a dimension distortion property of quasisymmetric mappings proved by Bishop-Hakobyan-Williams (2016) for the intermediate dimension of non-Ahlfors regular subsets of the space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a discrete measured groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, we study properties of the corresponding von Neumann algebra $L(\mathcal{G})$ using the techniques of Popa's deformation/rigidity theory. More specifically, we define and study the Gaussian deformation associated with any $1$-cocycle of $\mathcal{G}$ and use it to prove primeness and fullness under appropriate assumptions. We also characterize the maximal rigid subalgebras of $L(\mathcal{G})$ and produce unique prime factorization results for algebras of the form $L(\mathcal{G}_1\times\ldots\times\mathcal{G}_n)$.</description>

      <title>Measurable bounded cohomology of measured groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of measurable bounded cohomology for measured groupoids, extending continuous bounded cohomology of locally compact groups. We show that the measurable bounded cohomology of the semidirect groupoid associated to a measure class preserving action of a locally compact group $G$ on a standard Borel space is isomorphic to the continuous bounded cohomology of $G$ with twisted coefficients. We also prove the invariance of measurable bounded cohomology under similarity. As an application, we compare the bounded cohomology of (weakly) orbit equivalent actions and of measure equivalent groups. In this way we recover an isomorphism in bounded cohomology similar to one proved by Monod and Shalom. Other relevant consequences are related to the cohomological vanishing for actions of the Thompson group $F$, of higher rank lattices and of lattices in products of locally compact groups. We obtain a variant of the Eckmann-Shapiro isomorphism for transitive actions. In the case of a higher rank simple Lie group, we show that the cohomology of the action is actually determined by the usual cohomology of a suitable lattice. For amenable groupoids, we prove that the measurable bounded cohomology is trivial. This generalizes previous results by Monod, Anantharaman-Delaroche and Renault, and Blank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new sufficient conditions for the oscillatory and non-oscillatory behavior of solutions to nonautonomous advanced and delayed linear differential equations with piecewise constant arguments: $$x'(t) = a(t)x(t) + b(t)x([t-k]), \quad k \in \mathbb{Z},$$ in both impulsive and non-impulsive cases (DEPCA and IDEPCA, respectively). The results rely on classical oscillation criteria for difference equations and exploit the hybrid nature of these equations, connecting them to the theory of advanced and delayed difference equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a perturbation $f$ of a hyperbolic toral automorphism $L$. We study rigidity related to exceptional properties of the strong and weak stable foliations for $f$. If the strong foliation is mapped to the linear one by the conjugacy $h$ between $f$ and $L$, we obtain smoothness of $h$ along the weak foliation and regularity of the joint foliation of the strong and unstable foliations. We also establish a similar global result. If the weak foliation is sufficiently regular, we obtain smoothness of the conjugacy along the strong foliation and regularity of the joint foliation of the weak and unstable foliations. If both conditions hold then we get smoothness of $h$ along the stable foliation. We also deduce a rigidity result for the symplectic case. The main theorems are obtained in a unified way using our new result on relation between holonomes and normal forms.</description>

Abstract: We show that every open Riemann surface can be obtained by glueing together a countable collection of equilateral triangles, in such a way that every vertex belongs to finitely many triangles. Equivalently, it is a _Belyi surface_: There exists a holomorphic branched covering to the Riemann sphere that is branched only over three values. It follows that every Riemann surface is a branched cover of the sphere, branched only over finitely many points.</description>

      <title>Contact instantons and Proofs of Weinstein's conjecture and Arnold's chord conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is a continuation of the study of the interplay between the contact Hamiltonian dynamics and the moduli theory of (perturbed) contact instantons and its applications initiated in [Oh21b, Oh22a]. In this paper we prove Weinstein's conjecture and Arnold's chord conjecture in their full generalities. The two key ingredients lying in the background of our proof of Arnold's chord conjecture are the existence of the fundamental class of the Legendrian contact instanton cohomology modulo bubbling-off, and the evaluation transversality of the moduli space of contact instantons against the level set of conformal exponent function. Our proof of Weinstein's conjecture also utilizes the existence scheme of translated points of a contactomorphism developed in [Oh22a], especially associated to a contact Hamiltonian loop, via the geometric construction of the Legendrianization of contactomorphisms of $(Q,\lambda)$ in the contact product $M_Q = Q \times Q \times \mathbb R$ and its usage of the $\mathbb Z_2$ anti-contact involutive symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ be a primitive substitution on an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, and let $\mathcal{W}_n$ be the set of words of length $n$ determined by $\sigma$ (i.e., $w \in \mathcal{W}_n$ if $w$ is a subword of $\sigma^k(a)$ for some $a \in \mathcal{A}$ and $k \geq 1$). It is known that the corresponding substitution dynamical system is loosely Kronecker (also known as zero-entropy loosely Bernoulli), so the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ in the edit distance is $o(n)$. We improve this upper bound to $O(n/\sqrt{\log n})$. The main challenge is handling the case where $\sigma$ is non-uniform; a better bound is available for the uniform case. Finally, we show that for the Thue--Morse substitution, the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ is at least $\sqrt {n/6} - 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a smooth $d$-manifold $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb R^d$ if it admits a Lyapunov-Reeb function, i.e., a smooth map $f:M\to\mathbb R$ that is proper, lower-bounded, and has a unique critical point. By constructing such functions, we prove that the moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages and configurations are diffeomorphic to Euclidean spaces. This resolves the Refined Carpenter's Rule Problem and confirms a conjecture proposed by Gonz\'{a}lez and Sedano-Mendoza. Furthermore, we describe foliation structures of these moduli spaces via level sets of Lyapunov-Reeb functions and develop algorithms for related problems.</description>

Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</description>

      <title>On the verification of a Nicolas inequality</title>

Abstract: Nicolas inequality we deal can be written as \begin{equation}\label{Nicineq} e^\gamma \log\log N_x &lt; \dfrac{N_x}{\varphi(N_x)}\,, \end{equation} where $x\ge 2$, $N_x$ denotes the product of the primes less or equal than $x$, $\gamma$ is the Euler constant and $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. We see that verification of such an inequality depends on the sign of the Big-o function in the Mertens estimate for the sum of reciprocals of primes that. Then we analyze the value of such an error term.</description>

      <title>On the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture in Characteristics $\ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12826</link>

Abstract: Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short).
  $P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$.
  The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many characteristics.
  The existence of arithmetic obstructions within the context of $P(t)$--LC leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $ \ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their determination. This is shown to hold in an effective and explicit way.</description>
