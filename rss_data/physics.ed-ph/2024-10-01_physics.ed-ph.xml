      <title>Obtaining the dynamic coefficient of friction from the application of Newton's laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The friction force, friction coefficients and the effects on the dynamics of particles, bodies and systems, are fundamental themes in university physics of the first cycles and also in general physics courses of upper secondary education in Mexico, however Many facts on these subjects are given as a definition, for example; the dynamic coefficient of friction is less than the static one. In this work, a theoretical-experimental methodological proposal is exposed, to demonstrate why the relationship between the coefficients is like this, in addition some statistical parameters were used to quantify to what extent, the experimental design improved the initial approximations.</description>

      <title>ChatQCD: Let Large Language Models Explore QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has yielded a vast literature spanning distinct phenomena. We construct a corpus of papers and build a generative model. This model holds promise for accelerating the capability of scientists to consolidate their knowledge of QCD by the ability to generate and validate scientific works in the landscape of works related to QCD and similar problems in HEP. Furthermore, we discuss challenges and future directions of using large language models to integrate our scientific knowledge about QCD through the automated generation of explanatory scientific texts.</description>

      <title>Simple portable quantum key distribution for science outreach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has become an essential technology in the realm of secure communication, with applications ranging from secure data transmission to quantum networks. This paper presents a simple, compact, and cost-effective setup for undergraduate tutorial demonstrations of QKD. It relies on using weak coherent pulses, which can be readily produced using an attenuated laser. The system employs the simplified three-state BB84 protocol in free space, the states are encoded using linear polarization. Polarization encoding can be done passively or actively, depending on the budget available. Time multiplexing is implemented at the receiver to reduce the number of required detectors. Only two detectors are used to implement measurements on two bases, with a total of four outcomes. The result demonstrates the practicality of the system for free-space quantum communication, and its compact and portable nature makes it particularly suitable for pedagogical demonstrations. This work paves the way for engaging undergraduate students in the field of quantum communication through hands-on laboratory projects.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Discourse Group Roles in Inquiry-based University Science Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group work is commonly adopted in university science laboratories. In this study, we characterize student discourse group roles in inquiry-based science labs. The instructional context for the study was a summer program hosted at a private research university in the eastern United States. The program was designed as a bridge program for matriculating students who were first generation and/or deaf or hard-of-hearing (DHH). Accommodations such as interpreters and technology were provided for DHH students. We analyzed 15 students' discourse moves in five lab activities from the video recordings, resulting in a total of 40 student-lab units. We developed codes to describe student discourse moves: asking a question, proposing an idea, participating in discussion, chatting off-task, and talking to instructor. Through a cluster analysis using those 40 student-lab units on our quantified discourse moves, we identified four discourse styles, high on-task high social, high on-task low social, low on-task low social, and low on-task high social. The results show that individual students tend to demonstrate varying discourse styles in different lab activities; students' discourse styles within the same groups tend to be aligned with their group members. Moreover, no difference was observed in discourse styles between genders, but DHH students were observed to participate significantly less in group discourse compared to their non-DHH peers. We suggest that group-level interventions that specifically target discourse are needed to promote productive and equitable small-group discourse in university science labs.</description>
