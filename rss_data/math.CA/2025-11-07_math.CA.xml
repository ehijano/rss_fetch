      <title>Recurrence coefficients for the semiclassical Laguerrre weight and d-P$\left(A_{2}^{(1)}/E_{6}^{(1)}\right)$ equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use Sakai's geometric framework to explore the profound interconnection between recurrence coefficients of the semiclassical Laguerre weight $w(x)=x^{\lambda}\mathrm{e}^{-x^2+sx}$, $x\in\mathbb{R}^+$, $\lambda&gt;-1$, $s\in\mathbb{R}$, and Painlev\'e equations. Specifically, we introduce a new transformation for the expressions obtained by Filipuk et al. in their analysis of ladder operators for semiclassical Laguerre polynomials, thereby deriving a recurrence relation. Subsequently, we establish a correspondence between this recurrence relation and a class of d-P$\left(A_{2}^{(1)}/E_{6}^{(1)}\right)$ equations.</description>

      <title>Recurrence coefficients for the time-evolved Jacobi weight and discrete Painlev\'e equations on the $D_{5}$ Sakai surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the relationship between the d-P$\left(A_{3}^{(1)}/D_{5}^{(1)}\right)$ equations and a time-evolved Jacobi weight, $w(x)=x^{\alpha}(1-x)^{\beta}\mathrm{e}^{-sx}$, $x\in[0,1]$, $\alpha,\beta &gt; -1$, $s&gt;0$. From the perspective of Sakai's geometric theory of Painlev\'e equations, we derive that a recurrence relation closely related to the recurrence coefficients of monic polynomials orthogonal with $w(x)$ is equivalent to the standard d-P$\left(A_{3}^{(1)}/D_{5}^{(1)}\right)$ equation.</description>

      <title>Two-Scale Frostman Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a unified Frostman-type framework connecting the classical Hausdorff dimension with the family of intermediate dimensions $\dim_\theta$ recently introduced by Falconer, Fraser and Kempton. We define a new geometric quantity $\mathcal{D}(E)$ and prove that, under mild assumptions, there exists a family of measures $\{\mu_\delta\}$ supported on $E$ satisfying two simultaneous decay conditions, corresponding to the Hausdorff and intermediate Frostman inequalities. Such $(\delta, s, t)$-Frostman measures allow for a two-scale characterization of the dimension of $E$.</description>

      <title>Weighted wave envelope estimates for the parabola</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend Fefferman's classical square function estimate for the parabola to a weighted setting. Our weighted square function estimate is derived from a weighted wave envelope estimate for the parabola. The bounds are formulated in terms of families of multiscale tubes together with weight parameters that quantify the distribution of the weight. As an application, we obtain some weighted L^p-estimates for a class of Fourier multiplier operators and for solutions to free Schrodinger equation.</description>

      <title>Signature-Based Universal Bilinear Approximations for Nonlinear Systems and Model Order Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with non-Lipschitz nonlinear systems. Such systems can be approximated by a linear map of so-called signatures, which play a crucial role in the theory of rough paths and can be interpreted as collections of iterated integrals involving the control process. As a consequence, we identify a universal bilinear system, solved by the signature, that can approximate the state or output of the original nonlinear dynamics arbitrarily well. In contrast to other (bi)linearization techniques, the signature approach remains feasible in large-scale settings, as the dimension of the associated bilinear system grows only with the number of inputs. However, the signature model is typically of high order, requiring an optimization process based on model order reduction (MOR). We derive an MOR method for unstable bilinear systems with non-zero initial states and apply it to the signature, yielding a potentially low-dimensional bilinear model. An advantage of our method is that the original nonlinear system need not be known explicitly, since only data are required to learn the linear map of the signature. The subsequent MOR procedure is model-oriented and specifically designed for the signature process. Consequently, this work has two main applications: (1) efficient modeling/data fitting using small-scale bilinear systems, and (2) MOR for nonlinear systems. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in the second application through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interior estimates for solutions of the linear Poisson equation: $$ \triangle u = g u + f $$ where $g$ and $f$ belong to the Zygmund space $L\ln L$ on a Riemann surface $M$ satisfying the isoperimetric inequality. As applications, we derive corresponding interior estimates, Harnack inequalities, and a global estimate.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates and $\eta-$compactness for anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau minimizers with tangential anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider minimizers $u_\varepsilon$ of the Ginzburg-Landau energy with quadratic divergence or curl penalization on a simply-connected two-dimensional domain $\Omega$. On the boundary, strong tangential anchoring is imposed. We prove a priori estimates for $u_\varepsilon$ in $L^\infty$ uniform in $\varepsilon$ and that the Lipschitz constant of $u_\varepsilon$ blows up like $\varepsilon^{-1}$. We then deduce compactness for a subsequence that converges to an $\mathbb{S}^1-$valued map with either one interior point defect or two boundary half-defects. We conclude our study with a proof that no boundary vortices can occur in the divergence penalized case.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of slices of compact sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\theta$ intermediate dimensions are a continuous family of dimensions that interpolate between Hausdorff and Box dimensions of fractal sets. In this paper we study the problem of the relationship between the dimension of a set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ and the dimension of the slices $E\cap V$ from the point of view of intermediate dimensions. Here $V\in G(d,m)$, where $G(d,m)$ is the set of $m-$dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We obtain upper bounds analogous to those already known for Hausdorff dimension. In addition, we prove several corollaries referring to, among other things, the continuity of these dimensions at $\theta=0$, a natural problem that arises when studying them. We also investigate which conditions are sufficient to obtain a lower bound that provides an equality for almost all slices. Finally, a new type of Frostman measures is introduced. These measures combine the results already known for intermediate dimensions and Frostman measures in the case of Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Families of self-inverse functions and dilogarithm identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a self-inverse function via an integral equivalent to a two-term combination of dilogarithms. We refer to this function as a fundamental form, since there is a family of extensions of this function that satisfy similar self-inverse and symmetric properties. We also construct a family of functions generalizing the fundamental form via two auxiliary parameters, which we refer to as shape and scale factors. Through new integration techniques, we introduce and prove a variety of dilogarithm identities and evaluations for dilogarithm ladders and for two-term dilogarithm combinations. The functions$ \gemini_{a}^{b}(x)$ we introduce are referred to as gemini functions and may be seen as providing a broad framework in the derivation of and application of dilogarithm identities.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Krall polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we exhibit and study a novel class of exceptional Krall orthogonal polynomials of Hermite type. This means that the polynomials in question are (i) orthogonal with respect to a Hermite-type weight; (ii) are the eigenfunctions of a higher-order differential operator; (iii) the degree sequence of the polynomial family in question is missing a finite number of degrees. Regarding the second point, unlike the known class of exceptional Hermite polynomials that satisfy a second-order eigenvalue equation, the polynomials we introduce here are not eigenfunctions of any 2nd order differential operator, but are for one of 4th order. Regarding the third point, our family does not include a polynomial of degree zero and consequently satisfies a 5th order recurrence relation instead of the classical 3-term relation.</description>

      <title>Generalized mKdV Equation and Genus Two Jacobi Type Hyperelliptic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalized the mKdV equation in order that the static equations include ${\rm sn}$ differential equation. As a result, a good correspondence was obtained between the KdV equation and the mKdV equation.For general genus two hyperelliptic curves, we obtained differential equations for Weierstrass type and Jacobi type hyperelliptic functions. Considering the special case of $\lambda_6=0, \lambda_0=0$, Weierstrass type and Jacobi type hyperelliptic functions are different solutions to the same hyperelliptic differential equations. Then these solutions are connected by the special ${\rm Sp(4, {\bf R})}$ Lie group transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain optimal space-time estimates in $L^q_{t,x}$ spaces for all $q\ge 2$ for solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation on Zoll manifolds, including, in particular, the standard round sphere $S^d$. The proof relies on the arithmetic properties of the spectrum of the Laplacian on Zoll manifolds, as well as bilinear oscillatory integral estimates, which allow us to relate the problem to Strichartz estimate on one-dimensional tori.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Approach to Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations with Retarded Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review studies on the application of Lie group methods to delay ordinary differential equations (DODEs). For first- and second-order DODEs with a single delay parameter that depends on independent and dependent variables, the group classifications are performed. Classes of invariant DODEs for each Lie subgroup are written out. The symmetries allow us to construct invariant solutions to such equations. The application of variational methods to functionals with one delay yields DODEs with two delays. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are reviewed. The delay analog of the Legendre transformation, which relates the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches, is also analysed. Noether-type operator identities relate the invariance of delay functionals with the appropriate variational equations and their conserved quantities. These identities are used to formulate Noether-type theorems that give first integrals of second-order DODEs with symmetries. Finally, several open problems are formulated in the Conclusion.</description>
