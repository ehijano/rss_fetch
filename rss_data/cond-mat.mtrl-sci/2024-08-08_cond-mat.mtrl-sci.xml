      <title>A systematic Investigation of Thermoelectric Properties of Monolayers of ZrX2N4(X = Si, Ge)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, it has been demonstrated that monolayers of metal dichalcogenides are well-suited for thermoelectric applications. ZrX2N4 (X = Si, Ge) is a reasonable choice for thermoelectric applications when considering a favorable value of the figure of merit in two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. In this study, we examined the thermoelectric characteristics of the two-dimensional monolayer of ZrX2N4 (where X can be either Si or Ge) using a combination of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). A thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.90 was achieved at a temperature of 900 K for p-type ZrGe2N4, while a ZT of 0.83 was reported for n-type ZrGe2N4 at the same temperature. In addition, the ZrGe2N4 material exhibited a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of around 0.7 at room temperature for the p-type. Conversely, the ZrSi2N4 exhibited a relatively lower thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) at ambient temperature. At higher temperatures, the ZT value experiences a substantial increase, reaching 0.89 and 0.82 for p-type and n-type materials, respectively, at 900 K. Through our analysis of the electronic band structure, we have determined that ZrSi2N4 and ZrGe2N4 exhibit indirect bandgaps (BG) of 2.74 eV and 2.66 eV, respectively, as per the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) approximation.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law of Sim2Real Transfer Learning in Expanding Computational Materials Databases for Real-World Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenge of limited experimental materials data, extensive physical property databases are being developed based on high-throughput computational experiments, such as molecular dynamics simulations. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning a predictor pretrained on a computational database to a real system can result in models with outstanding generalization capabilities compared to learning from scratch. This study demonstrates the scaling law of simulation-to-real (Sim2Real) transfer learning for several machine learning tasks in materials science. Case studies of three prediction tasks for polymers and inorganic materials reveal that the prediction error on real systems decreases according to a power-law as the size of the computational data increases. Observing the scaling behavior offers various insights for database development, such as determining the sample size necessary to achieve a desired performance, identifying equivalent sample sizes for physical and computational experiments, and guiding the design of data production protocols for downstream real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Strain-driven stabilization of a room-temperature chiral ferroelectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear ferroic materials are sought after as testbeds to explore the intimate connections between topology and symmetry, which result in electronic, optical and magnetic functionalities not observed in collinear ferroic materials. For example, ferroaxial materials have ordered rotational structural distortions that break mirror symmetry and induce chirality. When ferroaxial order is coupled with ferroelectricity arising from a broken inversion symmetry, it offers the prospect of electric-field-control of the ferroaxial distortions and opens up new tunable functionalities. However, chiral ferroelectrics, especially ones stable at room temperature, are rare. We report the discovery of a strain-stabilized, room-temperature chiral ferroelectric phase in single crystals of BaTiS$_3$, a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) hexagonal chalcogenide. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the stabilization of this multiferroic phase having $P6_3$ space group for biaxial tensile strains exceeding 1.5% applied on the basal ab-plane of the room temperature $P6_3cm$ phase of BaTiS$_3$. The chiral ferroelectric phase is characterized by rotational distortions of select TiS$_6$ octahedra around the long $c$-axis and polar displacement of Ti atoms along the $c$-axis. We used an innovative approach using focused ion beam milling to make appropriately strained samples of BaTiS$_3$. The ferroaxial and ferroelectric distortions, and their domains in $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ were directly resolved using atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Landau-based phenomenological modeling predicts a strong coupling between the ferroelectric and the ferroaxial order making $P6_3$-BaTiS$_3$ an attractive test bed for achieving electric-field control of chirality-related phenomena such as circular photo-galvanic current and the Rashba effect.</description>

      <title>A Metastable Pentagonal 2D Material Synthesized by Symmetry-Driven Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most two-dimensional (2D) materials experimentally studied so far have hexagons as their building blocks. Only a few exceptions, such as PdSe2, are lower in energy in pentagonal phases and exhibit pentagons as building blocks. While theory has predicted a large number of pentagonal 2D materials, many of them are metastable and their experimental realization is difficult. Here we report the successful synthesis of a metastable pentagonal 2D material, the monolayer pentagonal PdTe2, by symmetry-driven epitaxy. Scanning tunneling microscopy and complementary spectroscopy measurements are used to characterize the monolayer pentagonal PdTe2, which demonstrates well-ordered low-symmetry atomic arrangements and is stabilized by lattice matching with the underlying Pd(100) substrate. Theoretical calculations, along with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, reveal monolayer pentagonal PdTe2 is a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 1.05 eV. Our work opens an avenue for the synthesis of pentagon-based 2D materials and gives opportunities to explore their applications such as multifunctional nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and optical properties of halide double perovskites from a Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide double perovskites are a chemically-diverse and growing class of compound semiconductors that are promising for optoelectronic applications. However, the prediction of their fundamental gaps and optical properties with density functional theory (DFT) and {\it ab initio} many-body perturbation theory has been a significant challenge. Recently, a nonempirical Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional has been shown to accurately produce the fundamental band gaps of a wide set of semiconductors and insulators, including lead halide perovskites. Here we apply the WOT-SRSH functional to five halide double perovskites, and compare the results with those obtained from other known functionals and previous $GW$ calculations. We also use the approach as a starting point for $GW$ calculations and we compute the band structures and optical absorption spectrum for Cs\textsubscript{2}Ag{Bi}Br\textsubscript{6}, using both time-dependent DFT and the $GW$-Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. We show that the WOT-SRSH functional leads to accurate fundamental and optical band gaps, as well as optical absorption spectra, consistent with spectroscopic measurements, thereby establishing WOT-SRSH as a viable method for the accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties of halide double perovskites.</description>

      <title>Ionic structure, Liquid-liquid phase transitions, X-Ray diffraction, and X-Ray Thomson scattering in shock compressed liquid Silicon in the 100-200 GPa regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cutting-edge experiments have provided $in\,situ$ structure characterization and measurements of the pressure ($P$), density ($\bar{\rho}$) and temperature ($T$) of shock compressed silicon in the 100 GPa range of pressures and up to $\sim$10,000K. We present first-principles calculations in this $P,T,\bar{\rho}$ regime to reveal a plethora of novel liquid-liquid phase transitions (LPTs), making the interpretation of these experiments very challenging. The short-ranged ionic structure of the fluid is preserved under collective adjustments of many distant atoms when subject to compression and heating, with surprisingly little change in electrical and thermal conductivities $\sigma$ and $\kappa$. We match the experimental X-Ray Thompson scattering and X-ray diffraction data theoretically, and provide pressure isotherms, ionization data and compressibilities that support the above picture of liquid silicon as a highly complex LPT-driven ``glassy'' metallic liquid. These novel results are relevant to materials research, studies of planetary interiors, high-energy-density physics, and in laser-fusion studies.</description>

      <title>Exotic thermoelectric properties of coronene-cyclobutadienoid graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials traditionally incorporate heavy metals to achieve low lattice thermal conductivity. However, elements such as Te, Bi, and Pb are costly and pose environmental hazards. In this study, we introduce a novel design strategy for thermoelectric materials, focusing on room-temperature, light-element, and high-ZT materials such as coronene-cyclobutadienoid graphene nanoribbons (cor4GNRs). This material demonstrates a ZT value exceeding 2.1, attributed to its exceptionally low phonon thermal conductivity resulting from its unique edge structure. Importantly, its electrical conductance and Seebeck coefficient remain relatively high and nearly unaffected by the edge structure. This distinct behavior in phonon and electronic transport properties leads to a remarkably high ZT value. Additionally, we discover that applying strain can significantly reduce phonon thermal conductivity, potentially increasing the ZT value to over 3.0. Our findings provide innovative insights for the design and application of advanced thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Giant electro-optic and elasto-optic effects in ferroelectric NbOI$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles calculations are performed to investigate the electro-optic (EO) and elasto-optic effects of the three-dimensional (bulk) and two-dimensional (monolayer) ferroelectric NbOI$_{2}$. Remarkably large linear EO and elasto-optic coefficients are discovered in both systems, when under stress-free conditions. We further found that the EO responses of bulk and monolayer NbOI$_{2}$ can be further enhanced with epitaxial strain, because of a strain-driven ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition that originates from the softening of some polar optical modes. Our findings thus point out that NbOI$_{2}$, as well as other niobium oxide dihalides are highly promising for paving the way for potentially efficient nonlinear optical device applications.</description>

      <title>Easy Access to Bright Oxygen Defects in Biocompatible Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes via a Fenton-Like Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The covalent functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with luminescent oxygen defects increases their brightness and enables their application as optical biosensors or fluorescent probes for in-vivo imaging in the second-biological window (NIR-II). However, obtaining luminescent defects with high brightness is challenging with the current functionalization methods due to a restricted window of reaction conditions or the necessity for controlled irradiation with ultraviolet light. Here we report a method for introducing luminescent oxygen defects via a Fenton-like reaction that uses benign and inexpensive chemicals without light irradiation. (6,5) SWNTs in aqueous dispersion functionalized with this method show bright $E_{11}$* emission (1105 nm) with 3.2-times higher peak intensities than the pristine $E_{11}$ emission and a reproducible photoluminescence quantum yield of 3%. The functionalization can be performed within a wide range of reaction parameters and even with unsorted nanotube raw material at high concentrations (100 mg/L), giving access to large amounts of brightly luminescent SWNTs. We further find that the introduced oxygen defects rearrange under light irradiation, which gives additional insights into the structure and dynamics of oxygen defects. Finally, the functionalization of ultra-short SWNTs with oxygen defects also enables high photoluminescence quantum yields and their excellent emission properties are retained after surfactant exchange with biocompatible pegylated phospholipids or single-stranded DNA to make them suitable for in-vivo NIR-II imaging and dopamine sensing.</description>

      <title>Electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity of Fe-H alloys at Earth's core conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport properties (electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity) of iron-hydrogen alloy are of great significance in the stability and evolution of planetary magnetic fields. Here, we investigate the thermal transport properties of iron doped with varying hydrogen content as functions of pressure (P) and temperature (T) for the top and bottom of Earth's outer core and beyond, corresponding to pressures of about 130 to 300 GPa and temperatures of 4000 to 7000 K. Using first-principles density functional theory molecular dynamic simulations (FPMD), we verify that crystalline FeH$_x$ is superionic with H diffusing freely. We find a low frequency viscosity of 10-11 mPa$\cdot$s for liquid Fe-H alloys at Earth's outer core conditions by the linear response Green-Kubo formula. Using the KKR method within density functional theory (DFT) plus Dynamical mean-field Theory (DMFT), we find saturation of electrical resistivity with increasing temperatures in liquid iron at outer core conditions. The effect of H on electrical and thermal transport we find is small, so that the exact H content of the core is not needed. The primary effect of H is on the equation of state, decreasing the density at constant P and T. We find the Lorenz number is smaller than the ideal value, and obtain for X(H)= 0.20, or 0.45 wt% H , thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of $\sim$105 and $\sim$190 $Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$, respectively, at conditions near the core-mantle and inner-outer core boundary.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Optoelectronic Processes in Colloidal 2D Multi-Layered MAPbBr3 Perovskite Nanosheets: Funneling, Recombination and Self-Trapped Excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi two-dimensional (2D) colloidal synthesis made quantum confinement readily accessible in perovskites, generating additional momentum in perovskite LED research and lasing. Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton binding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for solar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different thickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker layers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms by which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures is lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n = 3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n &gt; 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives comprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination processes. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes dominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5, Eb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their exciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative recombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping processes, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping when high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n regions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is bypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.</description>

      <title>Hidden elastic softness of low-symmetry frustrated $A$Ti$_2$O$_5$ ($A$ = Co, Fe)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthorhombic pseudobrookites CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ have a low-symmetry crystal structure comprising magnetic Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions and nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ ions, where the orbital-nondegenerate Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions form one-dimensional chains running along the orthorhombic $a$ axis. These compounds undergo an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \sim$ 26 K for CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and $T_N \sim$ 40 K for FeTi$_2$O$_5$. We perform ultrasound velocity measurements on single crystals of CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$. The measurements of these compounds reveal that the symmetry-lowering elastic modes of shear elastic moduli exhibit unusual elastic softness in the paramagnetic phase above $T_N$. This elastic softness indicates the presence of spin-lattice-coupled fluctuations above $T_N$ that should be a precursor to the symmetry-lowering lattice distortion at $T_N$. Furthermore, it is revealed that the magnitude of the unusual elastic softness is larger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$, which indicates that the spin-lattice coupling is stronger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$. The present study suggests that CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ are unique spin Jahn--Teller systems with low crystal symmetry, where, although the nature of exchange interactions is quasi-one-dimensional, the three-dimensional spin-lattice coupling releases the frustration by further lowering the crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Workflow-Centric Approach to Generating FAIR Data Objects for Mechanical Properties of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a data perspective, the field of materials mechanics is characterized by a sparsity of available data, mainly due to the strong microstructure-sensitivity of properties such as strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue limit. Consequently, individual tests are needed for specimens with various thermo-mechanical process histories, even if their chemical composition remains the same. Experimental data on the mechanical behavior of materials is usually rare, as mechanical testing is typically a destructive method requiring large amounts of material and effort for specimen preparation and testing. Furthermore, mechanical behavior is typically characterized in simplified tests under uniaxial loading conditions, whereas a complete characterization of mechanical material behavior requires multiaxial testing conditions. To address this data sparsity, different simulation methods, such as micromechanical modeling or even atomistic simulations, can contribute to microstructure-sensitive data collections. These methods cover a wide range of materials with different microstructures characterized under multiaxial loading conditions. In the present work, we describe a novel data schema that integrates metadata and mechanical data itself, following the workflows of the material modeling processes by which the data has been generated. Each run of this workflow results in unique data objects due to the incorporation of various elements such as user, system, and job-specific information in correlation with the resulting mechanical properties. Hence, this integrated data format provides a sustainable way of generating data objects that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). The choice of metadata elements has centered on necessary features required to characterize microstructure-specific data objects, simplifying how purpose-specific datasets are collected by search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Constraints on superconducting pairing in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the recently discovered altermagnetic materials hosts large prospects for both fundamental physics and technological applications. In this work we show that a characteristic spin-sublattice locking in altermagnets puts severe constraints on possible superconducting pairing. In particular, we uncover that the most common form of superconductivity, uniform $s$-wave spin-singlet pairing is not possible to achieve in altermagnets. Considering an effective model for a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet on a square lattice, we instead find that the most likely forms of spin-singlet pairing have $d_{x^2-y^2}$- or extended $s$-wave symmetry. We also find that the simplest form of equal-spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing is not allowed, but it can only exist as a mixed-spin-triplet $p$-wave state. We verify these constraints on pairing within an interaction-induced model of altermagnetism, where we also establish their validity for finite-momentum pairing. Additionally we discuss the possible pairing symmetries for odd-frequency superconducting pairing. Due to the generality of our results, they are applicable to both intrinsic superconductivity and proximity-induced superconductivity in altermagnet-superconductor hybrid junctions.</description>

      <title>Shift photocurrent vortices from topological polarization textures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. Due to the unconventional nature of vdW ferroelectricity, these topological polar structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. Here we propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moir\'e materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are anti-parallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for the experimental detection of topological polarization structures.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Reward-Driven Tuning of Scanning Probe Microscopy: Towards Fully Automated Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the dawn of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), tapping or intermittent contact mode has been one of the most widely used imaging modes. Manual optimization of tapping mode not only takes a lot of instrument and operator time, but also often leads to frequent probe and sample damage, poor image quality and reproducibility issues for new types of samples or inexperienced users. Despite wide use, optimization of tapping mode imaging is an extremely hard problem, ill-suited to either classical control methods or machine learning. Here we introduce a reward-driven workflow to automate the optimization of SPM in the tapping mode. The reward function is defined based on multiple channels with physical and empirical knowledge of good scans encoded, representing a sample-agnostic measure of image quality and imitating the decision-making logic employed by human operators. This automated workflow gives optimal scanning parameters for different probes and samples and gives high-quality SPM images consistently in the attractive mode. This study broadens the application and accessibility of SPM and opens the door for fully automated SPM.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature contribution towards $ 1s-2p_{\pm} $ interlayer exciton ultrafast transition within a $R-WSe_{2}/MoSe_{2} $ heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the spectrum of interlayer neutral excitons in transition-metal-dichalcogenide WeSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers in the $R$-stacking configuration. Most saliently, we show that, similarly to neutral excitons and trions in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, the spectrum is sensitive to the Berry curvature and thus quantum-geometric effects underlying the electron and hole wave functions. Due to the spatial separation between the electron and hole constituting the exciton in different layers, the Berry-curvature-induced splitting of the between the $2p_+$ and the $2p_-$ exciton states is smaller than for monolayer excitons. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of the exciton spectra on the dielectric environment and the twist angle between the two layers. Finally, the long-lived moir\'e interlayer exciton ground state ($1s$) enhances the possibility of creating brightened $2p_{\pm}$ states using a circularly polarized medium-infrared probe from the $1s$ ground state. As a result, we determine the polarizability of the $1s-2p_{\pm}$ transition, following by two-level dressed model for the optical Stark effect.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical materials with interconnected pores from capillary suspensions for bone tissue engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for bone grafts due to the aging population has opened new opportunities for the manufacture of porous ceramics to assist in bone reconstruction. In our study, we investigate a new, promising method to manufacture hierarchically porous structures in a straightforward, and tuneable way. It consists of combining the novel technology of capillary suspensions, formed by mixing solid particles and two immiscible liquids, one less than 5 vol%, with freeze casting. We have successfully achieved alumina and $\beta$-TCP materials with both &lt;2 $\mu$m and 20-50 $\mu$m as the smallest and largest pore size, respectively. The microstructure exhibits fully open pores and high levels of porosity (&gt; 60%). The capillary suspensions' rheological behaviour indicates that silica nano-suspensions as a secondary fluid creates a stronger internal particle network than sucrose for the alumina system. Conversely, the opposite was observed with the $\beta$-TCP system. These differences were attributed to the change in affinity between the secondary fluids and the solid loading. In our study, both systems have served to deepen the knowledge about the new area of capillary suspensions and prove their use in hierarchical porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Curvature-induced parity loss and hybridization of magnons: Exploring the connection of flat and tubular magnetic shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the connection between flat and curvilinear magnetization dynamics. For this, we numerically study the evolution of the magnon spectrum of rectangular waveguides upon rolling its cross-section up to a full tube. Magnon spectra are calculated over a wide range of magnetization states using a finite-element dynamic-matrix method, which allows us to trace the evolution of the magnon frequencies and several critical magnetic fields with increasing curvature. By analyzing the parity of the higher-order magnon modes, we find a curvature-induced mode hetero-symmetry that originates from a chiral contribution to the exchange interaction and is related to the Berry phase of magnons in closed loops. Importantly, this curvature-induced parity loss has profound consequences for the linear coupling between different propagating magnons, allowing for hybridization between initially orthogonal modes. In this context, we demonstrate the integral role of edge modes in forming the magnon spectrum in full tubes. Our findings provide new theoretical insights into curvilinear magnetization dynamics and are relevant for interpreting and designing experiments in the field.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Hall effects in a quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that electronic correlation, geometric frustration, and topology, \textit{individually}, can facilitate the emergence of various intriguing properties that have attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. Here, we report a systematic investigation on a quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$. A series of unconventional Hall effects are observed. In the paramagnetic phase, signature of dynamic $c$-$f$ hybridization is revealed by a reduction of anomalous Hall effect and is connected to frustration-promoted incoherent Kondo scattering. A large topological Hall effect exceeding 0.2 $\mu\Omega$ cm is found at low temperatures, which should be ascribed to the noncolinear magnetic structures of the frustrated quasi-kagome lattice. In addition, a peculiar loop-shaped Hall effect with switching chirality is also seen, which is inferred to be associated with magnetic domain walls that pin history-dependent spin chirality and / or Fermi-arc surface states projected from the in-gap Weyl nodes. These exotic results place Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$ in a regime of highly-frustrated antiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice with a nontrivial topology on an ``extended" global phase diagram, and highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, geometric frustration and topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spin polarization induced by electric fields in an isotropic chiral metal with boundaries using the Boltzmann formalism. We calculate both spin polarization in bulk in the linear response and antiparallel spin polarization near the boundary in the quadratic response against electric fields. We also work out spin polarization induced by the fluctuating electric fields, i.e., noises. Based on these results, we address chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) without biased inputs, CISS at room temperature, and the enantio-selective interaction between chiral materials and a magnetic substrate.</description>

      <title>Frustrated charge density wave and quasi-long-range bond-orientational order in the magnetic kagome FeGe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic frustrated nature of a kagome lattice is amenable to the realization of exotic phases of matter, such as quantum spin liquids or spin ices, and more recently the multiple-$\mathrm{\textbf{q}}$ charge density waves (CDW) in the kagome metals. Despite intense efforts to understand the mechanism driving the electronic modulations, its origin is still unknown and hindered by competing interactions and intertwined orders. Here, we identify a dimerization-driven 2D hexagonal charge-diffuse precursor in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe and demonstrate that the fraction of dimerized/undimerized states is the relevant order parameter of the multiple-$\mathrm{\textbf{q}}$ CDW of a continuous phase transition. The pretransitional charge fluctuations with propagation vector $\mathrm{\textbf{q}=\textbf{q}_M}$ at T$_{\mathrm{CDW}}$$&lt;$T$&lt;$T$^*$(125 K) are anisotropic, hence holding a quasi-long-range bond-orientational order. The broken translational symmetry emerges from the anisotropic diffuse precursor, akin to the Ising scenario of antiferromagnetic triangular lattices. The temperature and momentum dependence of the critical scattering show parallels to the stacked hexatic $\mathrm{B}$-phases reported in liquid crystals and transient states of CDWs and highlight the key role of the topological defect-mediated melting of the CDW in FeGe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative experimental protocol for the detection of doped Chern insulators and chiral superconductors. Our approach relies on coupling the target chiral system to adatom spins. Due to the substrate chirality, the adatom spins are expected to order in a noncoplanar configuration with a nonzero spin chirality. Here, we obtain concrete results for chiral substrates which are invariant under arbitrary spin rotations, and are coupled to three adatoms carrying classical moments. By exploring all the accessible magnetic ground states, we identify the regimes in which nonzero spin chirality is induced on the adatom complex. We apply our method to valley-polarized bilayer graphene and $d+id$ superconductors, and find qualitatively different ground state diagrams. Our analysis shows that the adatom spin chirality fully encodes the properties of the substrate chirality.</description>

Doping by different elements of hafnia films allows improving their ferroelectric properties.

      <description>arXiv:2310.18289v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use ultrafast x-ray diffraction to study non-equilibrium pathways of the phase transition in FeRh parametrized by the structural response. By increasing the pump-pulse duration beyond the electron-phonon coupling time, we suppress the electron-phonon non-equilibrium present upon femtosecond laser excitation but still photoexcite electrons to non-thermal states. Irrespective of the pump pulse duration, we find an optically induced nucleation of ferromagnetic domains on an $8\,\text{ps}$ timescale that starts as soon as the successively deposited energy surpasses the site-specific threshold energy. If in contrast, FeRh is only indirectly excited by diffusion of thermalized electrons from an opaque Pt cap layer, the ferromagnetic phase rises on a $50\,\text{ps}$ timescale. These findings unambiguously identify the photo-excitation of non-thermal electrons and not electron-phonon non-equilibria to enable the non-equilibrium pathway of the phase transition in FeRh.</description>

Abstract: Fusion energy is at an important inflection point in its development: multiple government agencies and private companies are now planning fusion pilot plants to deliver electricity to the grid in the next decade. However, realizing fusion as a technically and economically viable energy source depends on developing and qualifying materials that can withstand the extreme environment inside a fusion power plant. This Perspective seeks to engage the broader materials science community in this long-term effort. We first outline the principal materials challenges and research opportunities for fusion. Next, we argue that fusion is distinct from other energy applications with respect to materials, not just in the magnitude and complexity of the technical challenges but also in the present level of uncertainty in materials design requirements. To address this, we finally propose a research framework based on an iterative co-evolution of materials science and fusion power plant design requirements.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy in single-crystalline antiferromagnetic Mn$_2$Au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple recent studies have identified the metallic antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au to be a candidate for spintronic applications due to apparent in-plane anisotropy, preserved magnetic properties above room temperature, and current-induced N\'eel vector switching. Crystal growth is complicated by the fact that Mn$_2$Au melts incongruently. We present a bismuth flux method to grow millimeter-scale bulk single crystals of Mn$_2$Au in order to examine the intrinsic anisotropic electrical and magnetic properties. Flux quenching experiments reveal that the Mn$_2$Au crystals precipitate below 550{\deg}C, about 100{\deg}C below the decomposition temperature of Mn$_2$Au. Bulk Mn$_2$Au crystals have a room-temperature resistivity of 16-19 $\mu\Omega$-cm and a residual resistivity ratio of 41. Mn$_2$Au crystals have a dimensionless susceptibility on the order of 10$^{-4}$, comparable to calculated and experimental reports on powder samples. Single-crystal neutron diffraction confirms the in-plane magnetic structure. The tetragonal symmetry of Mn$_2$Au constrains the $ab$-plane magnetic susceptibility to be constant, meaning that $\chi_{100}=\chi_{110}$ in the low-field limit, below any spin-flop transition. We find that three measured magnetic susceptibilities $\chi_{100}$, $\chi_{110}$, and $\chi_{001}$ are the same order of magnitude and agree with the calculated prediction, meaning the low-field susceptibility of Mn$_2$Au is quite isotropic, despite clear differences in $ab$-plane and $ac$-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Mn$_2$Au is calculated to have an extremely high in-plane spin-flop field above 30 T, which is much larger than that of another in-plane antiferromagnet Fe$_2$As (less than 1 T). The subtle anisotropy of intrinsic susceptibilities may lead to dominating effects from shape, crystalline texture, strain, and defects in devices that attempt spin readout in Mn$_2$Au.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we derive an expression for magnetic dipole transitions that is analogous to the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation for dielectric polar lattice vibrations. We thereby define transverse and longitudinal optical frequencies at which paramagnetic resonance and antiresonance occurs, respectively. The relation found here thus permits non-invasive optical analysis of static magnetization properties in paramagnetic materials. Validated through terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance ellipsometry and superconducting quantum interference device measurements on Iron-doped Gallium Nitride, our findings show very good agreement between theory and experiment. We term the excitations associated with the paramagnetic transitions as paramagnetic polaritons which may find use in future photonic applications</description>

Abstract: With the use of chiral organic cations in two-dimensional metal halide perovskites, chirality can be induced in the metal halide layers, which results in semiconductors with intriguing chiral optical and spin-selective transport properties. The chiral properties strongly depend upon the temperature, despite the basic crystal symmetry not changing fundamentally. We identify a set of descriptors that characterize the chirality of metal halide perovskites such as MBA$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$, and study their temperature dependence using molecular dynamics simulations with on-the-fly machine-learning force fields obtained from density functional theory calculations. We find that, whereas the arrangement of organic cations remains chiral upon increasing the temperature, the inorganic framework loses this property more rapidly. We ascribe this to the breaking of hydrogen bonds that link the organic with the inorganic substructures, which leads to a loss of chirality transfer.</description>

      <title>Weight update in ferroelectric memristors with identical and non-identical pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) are a class of memristor which promise low-power, scalable, field-driven analog operation. In order to harness their full potential, operation with identical pulses is targeted. In this paper, several weight update schemes for FTJs are investigated, using either non-identical or identical pulses, and with time delays between the pulses ranging from 1 us to 10 s. Experimentally, a method for achieving non-linear weight update with identical pulses at long programming delays is demonstrated by limiting the switching current via a series resistor. Simulations show that this concept can be expanded to achieve weight update in a 1T1C cell by limiting the switching current through a transistor operating in sub-threshold or saturation mode. This leads to a maximum linearity in the weight update of 86% for a dynamic range (maximum switched polarization) of 30 {\mu}C/cm2. It is further demonstrated via simulation that engineering the device to achieve a narrower switching peak increases the linearity in scaled devices to &gt;93 % for the same range.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of Ta in the phase transition of Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 using low-temperature Raman spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Phase engineering strategies in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage. Various methods, including direct synthesis, pressure control, and chemical doping, have been employed to manipulate structural transitions in 2D-TMDs. Metal intercalation emerges as an effective technique to modulate phase transition dynamics by inserting external atoms or ions between the layers of 2D-TMDs, altering their electronic structure and physical properties. Here, we investigate the significant structural phase transitions in Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 single crystals induced by Ta intercalation using a combination of Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The results highlight the pivotal role of Ta atoms in driving these transitions and elucidate the interplay between intercalation, phase transitions, and resulting electronic and vibrational properties in 2D-TMDs. By focusing on Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 as an ideal case study and investigating like metal intercalation, this study advances understanding in the field and paves the way for the development of novel applications for 2D-TMDs, offering insights into the potential of these materials for future technological advancements.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy of Temperature Measurement on TEM samples using Plasmon Energy Expansion Thermometry (PEET): Addressing Sample Thickness Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) based microheaters have enabled in-situ materials characterization at the nanometer scale at elevated temperature. In addition to resolving the structural information at elevated temperatures, detailed knowledge of the local temperature distribution inside the sample is essential to reveal thermally induced phenomena and processes. Here, we investigate the accuracy of plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) as a method to map the local temperature in a tungsten (W) lamella in a range between room temperature and 700 degC. In particular, we address the influence of sample thickness in the range of a typical electron-transparent TEM sample (from 30 nm to 70 nm) on the temperature-dependent plasmon energy. The shift in plasmon energy, used to determine the local sample temperature, is not only temperature-dependent, but in case of W also thickness-dependent in sample thicknesses below approximately 60 nm. The results highlight the importance of considering sample thickness (and especially thickness variations) when analyzing the local bulk plasmon energy for temperature measurement using PEET. However, in case of W, an increasing beam broadening (FWHM) of the bulk plasmon peak with decreasing sample thickness can be used to improve the accuracy of PEET in TEM lamellae with varying sample thickness.</description>

      <title>Autonomous, Self-driving Multi-Step Growth of Semiconductor Heterostructures Guided by Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks by closed-loop, autonomous experimentation which enables accelerated optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in automated process with minimal human intervention. In this work, we develop SemiEpi, a self-driving automation platform capable of executing molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth with multi-steps, continuous in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard hardware, homemade software, curve fitting, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi operates autonomously, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes to achieve optimal outcomes. The platform actively learns from previous experimental results, identifying favorable conditions and proposing new experiments to achieve the desired results. We standardize and optimize growth for InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of ML-guided multi-step growth. A temperature calibration was implemented to get the initial growth condition, and fine control of the process was executed using ML. Leveraging RHEED movies acquired during the growth, SemiEpi successfully identified and optimized a novel route for multi-step heterostructure growth. This work demonstrates the capabilities of closed-loop, ML-guided systems in addressing challenges in multi-step growth for any device. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Our strategy facilitates the development of a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</description>

      <title>On electrical transport and thermoelectric performance in half-Heusler phase ScNiSb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Half-Heusler phases are among the most extensively studied thermoelectic materials. Bipolar thermal conductivity analysis performed for their sub-group based on rare-earth (R) metals, RNiSb, indicated on high mobility ratio in favor of electrons. The suggestion found its experimental verification and led to significant improvement of thermoelectric properties in $n$-type doped series ScNiSb$_{1-x}$Te$_x$. Recently, an alternative interpretation of transport properties in ScNiSb was proposed, where multi-parameter fit lead to mobility ratio in favor of holes. In this work we discuss the details of electrical properties and thermoelectric performance of ScNiSb in context of structural disorder. The article considers also relevant assumptions regarding band degeneracy and scattering mechanisms for effective mass modeling in ScNiSb. Lastly, technical difficulties of the model proposed by the others are addressed. We believe, that the provided insight will be useful for understating electrical transport in half-Heusler compounds, which can contribute to further improvement of their thermoelectric performance.</description>

      <title>Understanding the transport behaviour of PbSe: A combined experimental and computational study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lead chalcogenides are the promising thermoelectric (TE) materials having narrow band gap. The present work investigates the TE behaviour of PbSe in the temperature range 300-500 K. The transport properties of the sample have been studied using the Abinit and BoltzTrap code. The experimentally observed value of \textit{S} at 300 and 500 K is found to be $\sim$ 198 and 266 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$, respectively. The rate of increase in \emph{S} from 300 to 460 (460 to 500) K is found to be $\sim$ 0.4 (0.09). The temperature dependent electrical conductivity \textit{($\sigma$)} shows the increasing trend, with values of $\sim $ 0.35 $\times $ 10$^{3}$ and $\sim$ 0.58 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ $\Omega$$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$ at 300 and 500 K, respectively. Further, the value of thermal conductivity \textit{($\kappa$)} at 300 (500) K is found to be 0.74 (1.07) W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. The value of \textit{$\kappa$} is found to be increasing upto 460 K and then starts decreasing. The dispersion plot indicates that PbSe is a direct band gap semiconductor with band gap value of 0.16 (0.27) eV considering spin-orbit coupling (without SOC). The partial density of states (PDOS) plot shows that Pb 6p and Se 4p states have a major contribution in the transport properties. The observed and calculated values of \textit{S} gives a good match for SOC case. The calculated \textit{$\sigma$} and electronic part of thermal conductivity (\textit{$\kappa{_e}$}) gives good match with the experimental data. The maximum power factor (PF) value of $\sim$ 4.3 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ W/mK$^{2}$ is observed at 500 K. This work helps in understanding the TE behaviour of PbSe through a novel and insightful alliance of experimental measurements and DFT approach.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Flat Band and Van Hove Singularities with Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present a theoretical analysis (applicable to all twist angles of TBG) of band dispersion and density of states in TBG relating evolution of flat band and Van-Hove singularities with evolution of interlayer coupling in TBG. A simple tight binding Hamiltonian with environment dependent interlayer hopping and incorporated with internal configuration of carbon atoms inside a supercell is used to calculate band dispersion and density of states in TBG. Various Hamiltonian parameters and functional form of interlayer hopping applicable to a wide range of twist angles in TBG is estimated by fitting calculated dispersion and density of states with available experimentally observed dispersion and density of states in Graphene, AB-stacked bilayer graphene and some TBG systems. Computationally obtained band dispersion reveal that flat band in TBG occurs very close to Dirac point of graphene and only along linear dimension of two-dimensional wave vector space connecting two closest Dirac points of two graphene layers of TBG.</description>

      <title>Acousto-drag photovoltaic effect by piezoelectric integration of two-dimensional semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-to-electricity conversion is crucial for energy harvesting and photodetection, requesting efficient electron-hole pair separation to prevent recombination. Traditional junction-based mechanisms using built-in electric fields fail in non-barrier regions. Homogeneous material harvesting under photovoltaic effect is appealing but only realized in non-centrosymmetric systems via bulk photovoltaic effect. Here we report the realization of photovoltaic effect by employing surface acoustic waves (SAW) to generate zero-bias photocurrent in a conventional layered semiconductor MoSe2. SAW induces periodic modulation to electronic bands and drags the photoexcited pairs toward the travelling direction. The photocurrent is extracted by a local barrier. The separation of generation and extraction processes suppresses recombination and yields large nonlocal photoresponse. We distinguish acousto-electric drag and electron-hole pair separation effect by fabricating devices of different configurations. The acousto-drag photovoltaic effect, enabled by piezoelectric integration, offers an efficient light-to-electricity conversion method, independent of semiconductor crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>On Gibbs Equilibrium and Hillert Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During his time at Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan, KTH) in Sweden, the present author learned nonequilibrium thermodynamics from Mats Hillert. The key concepts are the separation of internal and external variables of a system and the definitions of potentials and molar quantities. In equilibrium thermodynamics derived by Gibbs, the internal variables are not independent and can be fully evaluated from given external variables. While irreversible thermodynamics led by Onsager focuses on internal variables though often mixed with external variables. Hillert integrated them together by first emphasizing their differences and then examining their connections. His philosophy was reflected by the title of his book "Phase Equilibria, Phase Diagrams and Phase Transformations" that puts equilibrium, nonequilibrium, and internal processes on equal footing. In the present paper honoring Hillert, the present author reflects his experiences with Hillert and his work in last 40 years and expresses his gratitude for all the wisdom and support from him in terms of "Hillert nonequilibrium thermodynamics" and discusses some recent topics that the present author has been working on.</description>

      <title>Magnonic $\varphi$ Josephson junctions and synchronized precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian physics. One of its main goals is to engineer dissipation and to explore ensuing functionality. In magnonics, the effect of dissipation due to local damping on magnon transport has been explored. However, the effects of non-local damping on the magnonic analog of the Josephson effect remain missing, despite that non-local damping is inevitable and has been playing a central role in magnonics. Here, we uncover theoretically that a surprisingly rich dynamics can emerge in magnetic junctions due to intrinsic non-local damping, using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, under microwave pumping, we show that coherent spin precession in the right and left insulating ferromagnet (FM) of the junction becomes synchronized by non-local damping and thereby a magnonic analog of the $\varphi$ Josephson junction emerges, where $\varphi$ stands here for the relative precession phase of right and left FM in the stationary limit. Remarkably, $\varphi$ decreases monotonically from $ \pi$ to $\pi/2$ as the magnon-magnon interaction, arising from spin anisotropies, increases. Moreover, we also find a magnonic diode effect giving rise to rectification of magnon currents. Our predictions are readily testable with current device and measurement technologies at room temperatures.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Transparent Electrodes: Interplay of High Purity SWCNTs network and a Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of transparent electrodes led to the development of optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs, LCDs, touchscreens, IR sensors, etc. Since ITO has many drawbacks in respect of its production cost and limited transparency in IR, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been a potential replacement for ITO due to their exceptional electrical and optical properties, especially in the IR region. In this work, we present the development of a CNT-polymer composite thin film that exhibits outstanding transparency across both visible and IR spectra prepared by layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. This approach not only ensures uniform integration and crosslinking of CNTs into lightweight matrices, but also represents a cost-effective method for producing transparent electrodes with remarkable optical and electrical properties. The produced films achieved a transparency above 80% in the UV-VIS range and approximately 70% in the mid-IR range. The sheet resistance of the fabricated thin films was measured at about 4 kOhm/sq, showing a tendency to decrease with the number of bilayers. Furthermore, in this work we have investigated electrical properties and transport mechanisms in more detail with computational analysis. Computational analysis was performed to better understand the electrical behavior of nanotube-polymer junctions in the interbundle structure. Based on all results, we propose that the transparent electrodes with 4 and 6 bilayers are the most optimal structures in terms of optical and electrical properties.</description>

      <title>Selected Configuration Interaction for Resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic resonances are metastable states that can decay by electron loss. They are ubiquitous across various fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, and biology. However, current theoretical and computational models for resonances cannot yet rival the level of accuracy achieved by bound-state methodologies. Here, we generalize selected configuration interaction (SCI) to treat resonances using the complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique. By modifying the selection procedure and the extrapolation protocol of standard SCI, the resulting CAP-SCI method yields resonance positions and widths of full configuration interaction quality. Initial results for the shape resonances of \ce{N2-} and \ce{CO-} reveal the important effect of high-order correlation, which shifts the values obtained with CAP-augmented equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with singles and doubles by more than \SI{0.1}{\eV}. The present CAP-SCI approach represents a cornerstone in the development of highly-accurate methodologies for resonances.</description>
