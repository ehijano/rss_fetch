      <title>The Aesthetic Imperative of Lev Landau's Geometric Reductionism in Theoretical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the ontological and epistemological foundations of Lev Landau's theoretical physics through the lens of his unpublished philosophical notes and scientific practice. We identify a unique form of geometric reductionism where physical laws emerge as inevitable consequences of symmetry breaking in progressively constrained phase spaces. Landau's dismissal of quantum interpretation debates and his famous "axiomatic minimalism" in the Course of Theoretical Physics are shown to stem from a deep epistemological commitment to dimensional aesthetics - the belief that fundamental truths must manifest through dimensional economy in mathematical representations.</description>

      <title>Determinism and Asymmetry in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the question of which collections of general relativistic spacetimes are deterministic relative to which definitions. We begin by considering a series of three definitions of increasing strength due to Belot (1995). The strongest of these definitions is particularly interesting for spacetime theories because it involves an asymmetry condition called ``rigidity'' that has been studied previously in a different context (Geroch 1969; Halvorson and Manchak 2022; Dewar 2024). We go on to explore other (stronger) asymmetry conditions that give rise to other (stronger) forms of determinism. We introduce a number of definitions of this type and clarify the relationships between them and the three considered by Belot. We go on to show that there are collections of general relativistic spacetimes that satisfy much stronger forms of determinism than previously known. We also highlight a number of open questions.</description>

      <title>Defining Determinism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determinism is the thesis that the past determines the future, but efforts to define it precisely have exposed deep methodological disagreements. Standard possible-worlds formulations of determinism presuppose an "agreement" relation between worlds, but this relation can be understood in multiple ways -- none of which is particularly clear. We critically examine the proliferation of definitions of determinism in the recent literature, arguing that these definitions fail to deliver clear verdicts about actual scientific theories. We advocate a return to a formal approach, in the logical tradition of Carnap, that treats determinism as a property of scientific theories, rather than an elusive metaphysical doctrine.
  We highlight two key distinctions: (1) the difference between qualitative and "full" determinism, as emphasized in recent discussions of physics and metaphysics, and (2) the distinction between weak and strong formal conditions on the uniqueness of world extensions. We argue that defining determinism in terms of metaphysical notions such as haecceities is unhelpful, whereas rigorous formal criteria -- such as Belot's D1 and D3 -- offer a tractable and scientifically relevant account. By clarifying what it means for a theory to be deterministic, we set the stage for a fruitful interaction between physics and metaphysics.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of Scientific Metrics in High Energy, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics in Latin America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive statistical analysis of key scientific metrics to evaluate the productivity and impact of research conducted in Latin American countries within the fields of High Energy Physics, Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (HECAP). Using data from the widely used open-access digital library INSPIRE-HEP, we provide a detailed assessment of the scientific contributions from the continent over the past 70 years. We provide data for the evolution of the overall productivity in the region relative to the rest of the world, comparing the productivity of each country, number of active researchers, number of publications, citations, h-index in total and relative to the population and number of researchers, as well as the productivity and impact compared to the percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) invested in research, and the Human Development Index (HDI) of each country. We also analyse collaborations among the different countries, as well as collaborations with the rest of the world. Additionally, we studied the gender gap evolution over the same period. This pioneering analysis, which relies solely on open data, can serve as an essential resource for researchers and policymakers alike. It aims to empower scientists with insights into the significance of their contributions to both regional and global research. Moreover, it provides both researchers and policymakers with critical quantitative data, strengthening their understanding of the progress in scientific productivity over the years to better support scientific endeavours in Latin America.</description>
