      <title>Impedance Measurement of Rolling Bearings Using an unbalanced AC Wheatstone Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry 4.0 drives the demand for cost-efficient and reliable process data and condition monitoring. Therefore, visualizing the state of tribological contacts becomes important, as they are regularly found in the center of many applications. Utilizing rolling element bearings as sensors and monitoring their health by the electrical impedance method are promising approaches as it allows e.g. load sensing and detection of bearing failures. The impedance cannot be measured directly, but there are various methods available. This work discusses advantages and disadvantages and suggests the AC Wheatstone bridge as a reliable way of measuring impedances with low phase angles at sampling rates in the kHz range. The corresponding equations are introduced, a simulation built, an uncertainty mode and effects analysis carried out and sample measurement results of real rolling elements shown. It can be demonstrated that the AC Wheatstone bridge meets the proposed requirements for sensory utilization and condition monitoring when the bearing is operated in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Compact Millimeter-Wave Antenna Array for 5G and Beyond: Design and Over-The-Air (OTA) Measurements Using Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and comprehensive measurements of a compact high-gain 32 element planar antenna array covering the n257 (26.5-29.5 GHz) millimeter wave (mmWave) band. First an 8-element quasi-uniform linear array is designed using a series-fed topology with fan shaped beams for point-to-multipoint connectivity followed by a compact corporate series feed network to design high-gain directive array for point-to-point connectivity. The radiation patterns of both antenna arrays in the azimuth and elevation planes are measured across a 180 degrees span using an over-the-air (OTA) compact antenna test range (CATR) system with a single rotary positioner. Moreover the procedure for quantifying and measuring the gain of mmWave antenna arrays is demonstrated in detail. The peak measured gain of the planar array is 18.45 dBi at 28.5 GHz while the half-power beamwidth of the planar array in the elevation and azimuth planes varies between 11 to 13 degrees, and 23-27 degrees respectively within the 26.5-29.5 GHz range. The measurement results match well with the simulations. The designed antenna array is suitable for various emerging 5G and beyond mmWave applications such as fixed wireless access, mmWave near-field focusing, high-resolution radar systems, and the characterization of mmWave path loss and channel sounding in diverse indoor environments and smart factories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality of health is greatly impacted by the quality of measurement, hence active monitoring of patient's vitals status greatly affects recovery and improves prognosis. In this paper, we proposed an IoT health based monitoring system which comprises of a wearable wristband mounted on the patient wrist to eliminate the concept of patient's being static. The wearable wristband composed of a digital temperature sensor and a pulse rate sensor can remotely monitor health status and utilizing Thingspeak result viewed via a web app or delivered on a smartphone to a specialist who is in a remote location. In order to achieve high accuracy in readings, the signal measured from the pulse rate sensor was passed through a two stage Hp-Lp circuit to eliminate DC offset and noise. In addition, a scaling factor of 10.41909 was formulated and used to convert the digital output from the pulse rate sensor into a more accurate representation of the patient heat rate readings. The results displayed by the proposed system proved the system to be well suited and reliable for healthcare monitoring.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Efficient and Reliable Coherent DSCM Systems Enabled by Single-Pilot-Tone-Based Polarization Demultiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, coherent digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM) technology has become an attractive solution for next-generation ultra-high-speed datacenter interconnects (DCIs). To meet the requirements of low-cost and low-power consumption in DCI applications, a comprehensive simplification of the coherent DSCM system has been investigated. The pilot-tone-based polarization demultiplexing (PT-PDM) technique, known for its low-power consumption and ultra-fast polarization tracking capabilities, has emerged as a compelling alternative to the power-hungry N-tap adaptive multi-input multiple-output (MIMO) equalizer. However, the effectiveness of this PT-PDM technique is extremely vulnerable to the receiver-side XY-skew (Rx-XY-skew), which is revealed in this paper for the first time. Then, a pilot-tone-enabled modified Godard phase detector (PT-MGPD) scheme is proposed to realize Rx-XY-skew estimation, serving as the prerequisite for the successful implementation of the PT-PDM and simplification of the adaptive equalizer. Both the simulation and experiment are conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed PT-MGPD scheme. The results prove it can achieve accurate estimation with an error of less than 0.3ps. Besides, a low-complexity, high-spectral-efficiency, and ultra-fast polarization demultiplexing method based on a single pilot tone (SPT) is proposed for the DSCM system in this work. Based on the proposed PT-MGPD and SPT schemes, the conventional N-tap MIMO equalizer served for each subcarrier can be successfully pruned into two polarization-independent single-input single-output equalizers, and there is no performance penalty even if the polarization rotation speed reaches 10Mrad/s. According to the results, the proposed schemes provide a hardware-efficient and reliable coherent DSCM solution for next-generation ultra-high-speed DCIs.</description>

      <title>Near-Field User Localization and Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems: Fundamentals, Recent Advances, and Outlooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multipleoutput (XL-MIMO) is believed to be a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. XL-MIMO uses more antennas to both achieve unprecedented spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) and exploit new electromagnetic (EM) phenomena occurring in the radiative near-field. The near-field effects provide the XL-MIMO array with depth perception, enabling precise localization and spatially multiplexing jointly in the angle and distance domains. This article delineates the distinctions between near-field and far-field propagation, highlighting the unique EM characteristics introduced by having large antenna arrays. It thoroughly examines the challenges these new near-field characteristics pose for user localization and channel estimation and provides a comprehensive review of new algorithms developed to address them. The article concludes by identifying critical future research directions.</description>

      <title>Edge Sampling of Graphs: Graph Signal Processing Approach With Edge Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding important edges in a graph is a crucial problem for various research fields, such as network epidemics, signal processing, machine learning, and sensor networks. In this paper, we tackle the problem based on sampling theory on graphs. We convert the original graph to a line graph where its nodes and edges, respectively, represent the original edges and the connections between the edges. We then perform node sampling of the line graph based on the edge smoothness assumption: This process selects the most critical edges in the original graph. We present a general framework of edge sampling based on graph sampling theory and reveal a theoretical relationship between the degree of the original graph and the line graph. We also propose an acceleration method for edge sampling in the proposed framework by using the relationship between two types of Laplacian of the node and edge domains. Experimental results in synthetic and real-world graphs validate the effectiveness of our approach against some alternative edge selection methods.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Ultrasound Beamforming using Synthetic Transmit Aperture with Low Complexity and High SNR for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an architecture for Ultrasound Beamforming using Synthetic Transmit Aperture with Low Complexity and High SNR for medical imaging. Synthetic Transmit Aperture is a novel approach in ultrasound imaging system by which frame rate and image quality is increased significantly on less data-transfer and computational requirements. The real-time beam-forming performance of Phased Array(PA) method is limited by high computation and cost. Thus STA method(data-transfer rate-8MB/frame) advances over the Phased Array Method(data-transfer rate-95MB/frame) with comparitively much higher frame rate and Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR. In this paper, we have implemented receive beamforming using Synthetic Transmit Aperture (STA) method for eight channels and have obtained the sample data for reconstruction of image. The experimental results are compared with the conventional phased array and linear array beamforming, where it can be observed that the reduction in memory requirement and high SNR</description>

      <title>CoSTAP: Clutter Suppression in Co-Pulsing FDA-STAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Range-dependent clutter suppression poses significant challenges in airborne frequency diverse array (FDA) radar, where resolving range ambiguity is particularly difficult. Traditional space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques used for clutter mitigation in FDA radars operate in the physical domain defined by first-order statistics. In this paper, unlike conventional airborne uniform FDA, we introduce a space-time-range adaptive processing (STRAP) method to exploit second-order statistics for clutter suppression in the newly proposed co-pulsing FDA radar. This approach utilizes co-prime frequency offsets (FOs) across the elements of a co-prime array, with each element transmitting at a non-uniform co-prime pulse repetition interval (C-Cube). By incorporating second-order statistics from the co-array domain, the co-pulsing STRAP or CoSTAP benefits from increased degrees of freedom (DoFs) and low computational cost while maintaining strong clutter suppression capabilities. However, this approach also introduces significant computational burdens in the coarray domain. To address this, we propose an approximate method for three-dimensional (3-D) clutter subspace estimation using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS) to balance clutter suppression performance and computational cost. We first develop a 3-D clutter rank evaluation criterion to exploit the geometry of 3-D clutter in a general scenario. Following this, we present a clutter subspace rejection method to mitigate the effects of interference such as jammer. Compared to existing FDA-STAP algorithms, our proposed CoSTAP method offers superior clutter suppression performance, lower computational complexity, and enhanced robustness to interference. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>New Paradigm for Secure Full-Duplex Transmission: Movable Antenna-Aided Multi-User Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate physical layer security (PLS) for full-duplex (FD) multi-user systems. To simultaneously protect uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions and ensure efficient use of time-frequency resources, we consider a base station (BS) that operates in FD mode and enables to emit the artificial noise (AN). Conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) at the BS struggle to fully exploit spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). Therefore, we propose a new paradigm for secure FD multi-user systems, where multiple transmit and receive movable antennas (MAs) are deployed at the BS to serve UL and DL users and effectively counter the cooperative interception by multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). Specifically, the MA positions, the transmit, receive, and AN beamformers at the BS, and the UL powers are jointly optimized to maximize the sum of secrecy rates (SSR). To solve the challenging non-convex optimization problem with highly coupled variables, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. This algorithm decomposes the original problem into three sub-problems, which are iteratively solved by the proposed multi-velocity particle swarm optimization (MVPSO) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme for MA-aided secure FD multi-user systems can significantly enhance security performance compared to conventional FPA systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Pilot Pattern Optimization for Channel Extrapolation in 5G NR Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pilot pattern optimization in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems has been widely investigated due to its positive impact on channel estimation. In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-user pilot pattern optimization for OFDM systems. In particular, the goal is to enhance channel extrapolation performance for 5G NR systems by optimizing multi-user pilot patterns in frequency-domain. We formulate a novel pilot pattern optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the maximum integrated side-lobe level (ISL) among all users, subject to a statistical resolution limit (SRL) constraint. Unlike existing literature that only utilizes ISL for controlling side-lobe levels of the ambiguity function, we also leverage ISL to mitigate multi-user interference in code-domain multiplexing. Additionally, the introduced SRL constraint ensures sufficient delay resolution of the system to resolve multipath, thereby improving channel extrapolation performance. Then, we employ the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to solve the formulated problem in an offline manner. Finally, we extend the formulated multi-user pilot pattern optimization problem to a multiband scenario, in which multiband gains can be exploited to improve system delay resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized pilot pattern yields significant performance gains in channel extrapolation over the conventional pilot patterns.</description>

      <title>Classification of Heart Sounds Using Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Network and LSTM-CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and cost-effective method for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities with high accuracy and reliability using low-cost systems in clinics. The primary limitation of automatic diagnosing of cardiac diseases is the rarity of correct and acceptable labeled samples, which can be expensive to prepare. To address this issue, two methods are proposed in this work. The first method is a unique Multi-Branch Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MBDCN) architecture inspired by human auditory processing, specifically designed to optimize feature extraction by employing various sizes of convolutional filters and audio signal power spectrum as input. In the second method, called as Long short-term memory-Convolutional Neural (LSCN) model, Additionally, the network architecture includes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network blocks to improve feature extraction in the time domain. The innovative approach of combining multiple parallel branches consisting of the one-dimensional convolutional layers along with LSTM blocks helps in achieving superior results in audio signal processing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art techniques. The overall classification accuracy of heart sounds with the LSCN network is more than 96%. The efficiency of this network is significant compared to common feature extraction methods such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and wavelet transform. Therefore, the proposed method shows promising results in the automatic analysis of heart sounds and has potential applications in the diagnosis and early detection of cardiovascular diseases.</description>

      <title>Real and imaginary part symmetries (RIPS) and artifacts removal in 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy without water suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Proton MR spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) without water suppression (WS) possess some distinct advantages over the conventionally used 1H MRSI with WS. However, the sideband artifacts in the non-water suppressed spectra hinder the applications of the 1H MRSI without WS. Although many hardware or software techniques to tackle the sidebands have been developed, they suffer from various shortcomings, such as the prolonged data acquisition time, insufficient elimination of the sidebands, or loss of some spectral information. Here, we present a software method that allows the elimination of sideband artifacts from 1H MRSI data acquired without WS. Methods The presented method is based on the following observations: (1) the real part of the sidebands is anti-symmetric, and the imaginary part of sidebands is symmetric about the unsuppressed water signal, which is at the center of the spectrum, and (2) there is no observable metabolite resonances in the downfield region spectrum acquired with conventional MRSI pulse sequences. We model the complex sidebands in the downfield region using a singular value decomposition-based method, reconstruct from them the upfield sidebands according to the symmetry features of the sidebands, and subtract the sidebands from the spectrum. We demonstrate the method using phantom and in vivo data. Results The method can remarkably reduce sideband artifacts in both the real and the imaginary parts of the spectrum. In both phantom data and high-quality in vivo data, the residual sidebands are smaller than those in the WS spectra. Conclusion The method allows to remove sideband artifacts in both the real and the imaginary parts of the spectrum. The performance of the method on phantom data and high-quality in vivo data outperforms on poor quality in vivo data.</description>

      <title>Biased Backpressure Routing Using Link Features and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce the latency of Backpressure (BP) routing in wireless multi-hop networks, we propose to enhance the existing shortest path-biased BP (SP-BP) and sojourn time-based backlog metrics, since they introduce no additional time step-wise signaling overhead to the basic BP. Rather than relying on hop-distance, we introduce a new edge-weighted shortest path bias built on the scheduling duty cycle of wireless links, which can be predicted by a graph convolutional neural network based on the topology and traffic of wireless networks. Additionally, we tackle three long-standing challenges associated with SP-BP: optimal bias scaling, efficient bias maintenance, and integration of delay awareness. Our proposed solutions inherit the throughput optimality of the basic BP, as well as its practical advantages of low complexity and fully distributed implementation. Our approaches rely on common link features and introduces only a one-time constant overhead to previous SP-BP schemes, or a one-time overhead linear in the network size to the basic BP. Numerical experiments show that our solutions can effectively address the major drawbacks of slow startup, random walk, and the last packet problem in basic BP, improving the end-to-end delay of existing low-overhead BP algorithms under various settings of network traffic, interference, and mobility.</description>

      <title>SensEmo: Enabling Affective Learning through Real-time Emotion Recognition with Smartwatches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated the capability of physiological signals to infer both user emotional and attention responses. This presents an opportunity for leveraging widely available physiological sensors in smartwatches, to detect real-time emotional cues in users, such as stress and excitement. In this paper, we introduce SensEmo, a smartwatch-based system designed for affective learning. SensEmo utilizes multiple physiological sensor data, including heart rate and galvanic skin response, to recognize a student's motivation and concentration levels during class. This recognition is facilitated by a personalized emotion recognition model that predicts emotional states based on degrees of valence and arousal. With real-time emotion and attention feedback from students, we design a Markov decision process-based algorithm to enhance student learning effectiveness and experience by by offering suggestions to the teacher regarding teaching content and pacing. We evaluate SensEmo with 22 participants in real-world classroom environments. Evaluation results show that SensEmo recognizes student emotion with an average of 88.9% accuracy. More importantly, SensEmo assists students to achieve better online learning outcomes, e.g., an average of 40.0% higher grades in quizzes, over the traditional learning without student emotional feedback.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been considered as an efficient way to boost the computation capability of mobile edge computing (MEC) system, especially when the communication links is blocked or the communication signal is weak. However, most existing works are restricted to narrow-band channel and ideal IRS reflection model, which is not practical and may lead to significant performance degradation in realistic systems. To further exploit the benefits of IRS in MEC system, we consider an IRS-enhanced wideband MEC system with practical IRS reflection model. With the aim of minimizing the weighted latency of all devices, the offloading data volume, edge computing resource, BS's receiving vector, and IRS passive beamforming are jointly optimized. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, we employ the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique to decouple it into two subproblems for alternatively optimizing computing and communication settings. The effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithm are validate via numerical analyses. In addition, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve lower latency compared to that based on the ideal IRS reflection model, which confirms the necessary of considering practical model when designing an IRS-enhanced wideband MEC system.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Positioning with Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces under Mismatched Orientations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate localization can be performed in visible light systems in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios by utilizing intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), which are commonly in the form of mirror arrays with adjustable orientations. When signals transmitted from light emitting diodes (LEDs) are reflected from IRSs and collected by a receiver, the position of the receiver can be estimated based on power measurements by utilizing the known parameters of the LEDs and IRSs. Since the orientation vectors of IRS elements (mirrors) cannot be adjusted perfectly in practice, it is important to evaluate the effects of mismatches between desired and true orientations of IRS elements. In this study, we derive the misspecified Cramer-Rao lower bound (MCRB) and the mismatched maximum likelihood (MML) estimator for specifying the estimation performance and the lower bound in the presence of mismatches in IRS orientations. We also provide comparisons with the conventional maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and the CRB in absence of orientation mismatches for quantifying the effects of mismatches. It is shown that orientation mismatches can result in significant degradation in localization accuracy at high signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Efficiency of Multi-user Holographic MIMO Uplink Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With antenna spacing much less than half a wavelength in confined space, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) technology presents a promising frontier in next-generation mobile communication. We delve into the research of the multi-user uplink transmission with both the base station and the users equipped with holographic planar arrays. To begin, we construct an HMIMO channel model utilizing electromagnetic field equations, accompanied by a colored noise model that accounts for both electromagnetic interference and hardware noise. Since this model is continuous, we approximate it within a finite-dimensional space spanned by Fourier space series, which can be defined as the communication mode functions. We show that this channel model samples Green's function in the wavenumber domain in different communication modes. Subsequently, we tackle the challenging task of maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system, which involves optimizing the continuous current density function (CDF) for each user. Using the aforementioned approximation model, we transform the optimization variables into expansion coefficients of the CDFs on a finite-dimensional space, for which we propose an iterative water-filling algorithm. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in enhancing the system SE and show the influence of the colored noise and the system parameters on the SE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.10546v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sinc function is often used as the basis for the design of discrete linear-phase FIR filters. However the Fourier transform of the truncated sinc function exhibits ripple in the pass band due to the Gibbs phenomenon. This paper introduces an alternative function based on Chebyshev polynomials whose Fourier transform decreases monotonically in the pass band. Furthermore this function features an intrinsic window function with an adjustable parameter influencing the Fourier transform in the transition and stop bands.</description>

      <title>You Can Wash Hands Better: Accurate Daily Handwashing Assessment with Smartwatches</title>

Abstract: Hand hygiene is one of the most efficient daily actions to prevent infectious diseases, such as Influenza, Malaria, and skin infections. We have been suggested to wash our hands under professional guidelines to prevent virus infection. However, several surveys show that very few people follow this suggestion. Thus we propose UWash, a wearable solution with smartwatches, to assess handwashing procedures for the purpose of raising users' awareness and cultivating habits of high-quality handwashing. We address the task of handwashing assessment from readings of motion sensors similar to the action segmentation problem in computer vision, and propose a simple and lightweight two-stream UNet-like network to achieve it effectively. Experiments over 51 subjects show that UWash achieves an accuracy of 92.27% on handwashing gesture recognition, &lt;0.5 seconds error on onset/offset detection, and &lt;5 points error on gesture scoring in the user-dependent setting, and keeps promising in the user-independent evaluation and the user-independent-location-independent evaluation. UWash even performs well on 10 random passersby in a hospital 9 months later. UWash is the first work that scores the handwashing quality by gesture sequences and is instructive to guide users in promoting hand hygiene in daily life. Code and data are avaliable at https://github.com/aiotgroup/UWash</description>

      <title>The Power of Large Language Models for Wireless Communication System Development: A Case Study on FPGA Platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07319v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention across various research disciplines, including the wireless communication community. There have been several heated discussions on the intersection of LLMs and wireless technologies. While recent studies have demonstrated the ability of LLMs to generate hardware description language (HDL) code for simple computation tasks, developing wireless prototypes and products via HDL poses far greater challenges because of the more complex computation tasks involved. In this paper, we aim to address this challenge by investigating the role of LLMs in FPGA-based hardware development for advanced wireless signal processing. We begin by exploring LLM-assisted code refactoring, reuse, and validation, using an open-source software-defined radio (SDR) project as a case study. Through the case study, we find that an LLM assistant can potentially yield substantial productivity gains for researchers and developers. We then examine the feasibility of using LLMs to generate HDL code for advanced wireless signal processing, using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm as an example. This task presents two unique challenges: the scheduling of subtasks within the overall task and the multi-step thinking required to solve certain arithmetic problem within the task. To address these challenges, we employ in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques, culminating in the successful generation of a 64-point Verilog FFT module. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs for generalization and imitation, affirming their usefulness in writing HDL code for wireless communication systems. Overall, this work contributes to understanding the role of LLMs in wireless communication and motivates further exploration of their capabilities.</description>

      <title>Detection of Ghost Targets for Automotive Radar in the Presence of Multipath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has been widely used in automotive radars as it provides accurate angular estimation of the objects with relatively small number of transmitting and receiving antennas. Since the Direction Of Departure (DOD) and the Direction Of Arrival (DOA) of line-of-sight targets coincide, MIMO signal processing allows forming a larger virtual array for angle finding. However, multiple paths impinging the receiver is a major limiting factor, in that radar signals may bounce off obstacles, creating echoes for which the DOD does not equal the DOA. Thus, in complex scenarios with multiple scatterers, the direct paths of the intended targets may be corrupted by indirect paths from other objects, which leads to inaccurate angle estimation or ghost targets. In this paper, we focus on detecting the presence of ghosts due to multipath by regarding it as the problem of deciding between a composite hypothesis, H0 say, that the observations only contain an unknown number of direct paths sharing the same (unknown) DOD's and DOA's, and a composite alternative, H1 say, that the observations also contain an unknown number of indirect paths, for which DOD's and DOA's do not coincide. We exploit the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) philosophy to determine the detector structure, wherein the unknown parameters are replaced by carefully designed estimators. The angles of both the active direct paths and of the multi-paths are indeed estimated through a sparsity-enforced Compressed Sensing (CS) approach with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization to estimate the angular parameters in the continuous domain. An extensive performance analysis is finally offered in order to validate the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Quantized ISAC LEO Satellite Systems: A Max-Min Fair Energy-Efficient Beam Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems with sensing functionality are envisioned to facilitate global-coverage service and emerging applications in 6G. Currently, two fundamental challenges, namely, inter-beam interference among users and power limitation at the LEO satellites, limit the full potential of the joint design of sensing and communication. To effectively control the interference, a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme is employed as the interference management strategy in the system design. On the other hand, to address the limited power supply at the LEO satellites, we consider low-resolution quantization digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at the transmitter to reduce power consumption, which grows exponentially with the number of quantization bits. Additionally, optimizing the total energy efficiency (EE) of the system is a common practice to save the power. However, this metric lacks fairness among users. To ensure this fairness and further enhance EE, we investigate the max-min fairness EE of the RSMA-assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)-LEO satellite system. In this system, the satellite transmits a quantized dual-functional signal serving downlink users while detecting a target. Specifically, we optimize the precoders for maximizing the minimal EE among all users, considering the power consumption of each radio frequency (RF) chain under communication and sensing constraints. To tackle this optimization problem, we proposed an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach's method. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed design and RSMA architecture outperforms strategies maximizing the total EE of the system, space-division multiple access (SDMA), and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in terms of max-min fairness EE and the communication-sensing trade-off.</description>

Abstract: SARComm is a novel wireless communication system that enables passive satellite backscatter connectivity using existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals. We demonstrate that SAR signals from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite, used to image Earth's terrain, can be leveraged to enable low-power ground-to-satellite communication. This paper presents the first cooperative, on-the-ground target that modulates SAR backscatter to send information bits and analyzes how to extract them from publicly available Sentinel-1 datasets. To demonstrate the system, we evaluate the effectiveness of modulating the radar cross section of corner reflectors both mechanically and electronically to encode data bits, develop a deployment algorithm to optimize corner reflector placement, and present a SAR processing pipeline to enable communication.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) opens up new service possibilities for sixth-generation (6G) systems, where both communication and sensing (C&amp;S) functionalities co-exist by sharing the same hardware platform and radio resource. In this paper, we investigate the waveform design problem in a downlink multi-user and multi-target ISAC system under different C&amp;S performance preferences. The multi-user interference (MUI) may critically degrade the communication performance. To eliminate the MUI, we employ the constructive interference mechanism into the ISAC system, which saves the power budget for communication. However, due to the conflict between C&amp;S metrics, it is intractable for the ISAC system to achieve the optimal performance of C&amp;S objective simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to strike a trade-off between C&amp;S objectives. By virtue of the multi-objective optimization theory, we propose a weighted Tchebycheff-based transformation method to re-frame the C&amp;S trade-off problem as a Pareto-optimal problem, thus effectively tackling the constraints in ISAC systems. Finally, simulation results reveal the trade-off relation between C&amp;S performances, which provides insights for the flexible waveform design under different C&amp;S performance preferences in MIMO-ISAC systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation of an active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided uplink Internet of Things (IoT) network is investigated. Firstly, the least square (LS) estimators for the direct channel and the cascaded channel are presented, respectively. The corresponding mean square errors (MSE) of channel estimators are derived. Subsequently, in order to evaluate the influence of adjusting the transmit power at the IoT devices or the reflected power at the active IRS on Sum-MSE performance, two situations are considered. In the first case, under the total power sum constraint of the IoT devices and active IRS, the closed-form expression of the optimal power allocation factor is derived. In the second case, when the transmit power at the IoT devices is fixed, there exists an optimal reflective power at active IRS. To further improve the estimation performance, the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based direct channel estimation (CDCE) algorithm and the CNN-based cascaded channel estimation (CCCE) algorithm are designed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the existence of an optimal power allocation strategy that minimizes the Sum-MSE, and further validate the superiority of the proposed CDCE / CCCE algorithms over their respective traditional LS and minimum mean square error (MMSE) baselines.</description>

      <title>A Convex Method of Generalized State Estimation using Circuit-theoretic Node-breaker Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14742v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date topology is critical for situational awareness of a power grid; however, wrong switch statuses due to physical damage, communication error, or cyber-attack, can often result in topology errors. To maintain situation awareness under the possible topology errors and bad data, this paper develops ckt-GSE, a circuit-theoretic generalized state estimation method using node-breaker (NB) model. Ckt- GSE is a convex and scalable model that jointly estimates AC state variables and network topology, with robustness against different data errors. The method first constructs an equivalent circuit representation of the AC power grid by developing and aggregating linear circuit models of SCADA meters, phasor measurement units(PMUs), and switching devices. Then based on this circuit, ckt-GSE defines a constrained optimization problem using weighted least absolute value (WLAV) objective to form a robust estimator. The problem is a Linear Programming (LP) problem whose solution includes accurate AC states and a sparse vector of noise terms to identify topology errors and bad data.This paper is the first to explore a circuit-theoretic approach for an AC-network constrained GSE algorithm that is: 1) applicable to the real-world data setting, 2) convex without relaxation, scalable with our circuit-based solver; and 3) robust with the ability to identify and reject different data errors</description>

Abstract: Quantum systems of infinite dimension, such as bosonic oscillators, provide vast resources for quantum sensing. Yet, a general theory on how to manipulate such bosonic modes for sensing beyond parameter estimation is unknown. We present a general algorithmic framework, quantum signal processing interferometry (QSPI), for quantum sensing at the fundamental limits of quantum mechanics by generalizing Ramsey-type interferometry. Our QSPI sensing protocol relies on performing nonlinear polynomial transformations on the oscillator's quadrature operators by generalizing quantum signal processing (QSP) from qubits to hybrid qubit-oscillator systems. We use our QSPI sensing framework to make efficient binary decisions on a displacement channel in the single-shot limit. Theoretical analysis suggests the sensing accuracy, given a single-shot qubit measurement, scales inversely with the sensing time or circuit depth of the algorithm. We further concatenate a series of such binary decisions to perform parameter estimation in a bit-by-bit fashion. Numerical simulations are performed to support these statements. Our QSPI protocol offers a unified framework for quantum sensing using continuous-variable bosonic systems beyond parameter estimation and establishes a promising avenue toward efficient and scalable quantum control and quantum sensing schemes beyond the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of multiple distributed intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), which are deployed and optimized by a mobile operator (MO), on the performance of user equipments (UEs) served by other co-existing out-of-band (OOB) MOs that do not control the IRSs. We show that, under round-robin scheduling, in mmWave frequencies, the ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) of an OOB MO increases logarithmically in the total number of IRS elements with a pre-log factor that increases with the ratio of the number of OOB paths through the IRS to the number of elements at an IRS. We further show that the maximum achievable SE of the OOB MO scales log-linearly with the total IRS elements, with a pre-log factor of $1$. Then, we specify the minimum number of IRSs as a function of the channel parameters and design a distributed IRS system in which an OOB MO almost surely obtains the maximum SE. Finally, we prove that the outage probability at an OOB UE decreases exponentially as the number of IRSs increases, even though they are randomly configured from the OOB UE's viewpoint. We numerically verify our theory and conclude that distributed IRSs always help every MO, but the MO controlling the IRSs benefits the most.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning of Shared Spatiotemporal EEG Representations Across Individuals for Naturalistic Neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14213</link>

Abstract: Neural representations induced by naturalistic stimuli offer insights into how humans respond to stimuli in daily life. Understanding neural mechanisms underlying naturalistic stimuli processing hinges on the precise identification and extraction of the shared neural patterns that are consistently present across individuals. Targeting the Electroencephalogram (EEG) technique, known for its rich spatial and temporal information, this study presents a framework for Contrastive Learning of Shared SpatioTemporal EEG Representations across individuals (CL-SSTER). CL-SSTER utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the similarity of EEG representations across individuals for identical stimuli, contrasting with those for varied stimuli. The network employed spatial and temporal convolutions to simultaneously learn the spatial and temporal patterns inherent in EEG. The versatility of CL-SSTER was demonstrated on three EEG datasets, including a synthetic dataset, a natural speech comprehension EEG dataset, and an emotional video watching EEG dataset. CL-SSTER attained the highest inter-subject correlation (ISC) values compared to the state-of-the-art ISC methods. The latent representations generated by CL-SSTER exhibited reliable spatiotemporal EEG patterns, which can be explained by properties of the naturalistic stimuli. CL-SSTER serves as an interpretable and scalable framework for the identification of inter-subject shared neural representations in naturalistic neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Latency-Aware Generative Semantic Communications with Pre-Trained Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17256</link>

Abstract: Generative foundation AI models have recently shown great success in synthesizing natural signals with high perceptual quality using only textual prompts and conditioning signals to guide the generation process. This enables semantic communications at extremely low data rates in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop a latency-aware semantic communications framework with pre-trained generative models. The transmitter performs multi-modal semantic decomposition on the input signal and transmits each semantic stream with the appropriate coding and communication schemes based on the intent. For the prompt, we adopt a re-transmission-based scheme to ensure reliable transmission, and for the other semantic modalities we use an adaptive modulation/coding scheme to achieve robustness to the changing wireless channel. Furthermore, we design a semantic and latency-aware scheme to allocate transmission power to different semantic modalities based on their importance subjected to semantic quality constraints. At the receiver, a pre-trained generative model synthesizes a high fidelity signal using the received multi-stream semantics. Simulation results demonstrate ultra-low-rate, low-latency, and channel-adaptive semantic communications.</description>

      <title>Towards Task-Compatible Compressible Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify an issue in multi-task learnable compression, in which a representation learned for one task does not positively contribute to the rate-distortion performance of a different task as much as expected, given the estimated amount of information available in it. We interpret this issue using the predictive $\mathcal{V}$-information framework. In learnable scalable coding, previous work increased the utilization of side-information for input reconstruction by also rewarding input reconstruction when learning this shared representation. We evaluate the impact of this idea in the context of input reconstruction more rigorously and extended it to other computer vision tasks. We perform experiments using representations trained for object detection on COCO 2017 and depth estimation on the Cityscapes dataset, and use them to assist in image reconstruction and semantic segmentation tasks. The results show considerable improvements in the rate-distortion performance of the assisted tasks. Moreover, using the proposed representations, the performance of the base tasks are also improved. Results suggest that the proposed method induces simpler representations that are more compatible with downstream processes.</description>

      <title>Model-based learning for multi-antenna multi-frequency location-to-channel mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Years of study of the propagation channel showed a close relation between a location and the associated communication channel response. The use of a neural network to learn the location-to-channel mapping can therefore be envisioned. The Implicit Neural Representation (INR) literature showed that classical neural architecture are biased towards learning low-frequency content, making the location-to-channel mapping learning a non-trivial problem. Indeed, it is well known that this mapping is a function rapidly varying with the location, on the order of the wavelength. This paper leverages the model-based machine learning paradigm to derive a problem-specific neural architecture from a propagation channel model. The resulting architecture efficiently overcomes the spectral-bias issue. It only learns low-frequency sparse correction terms activating a dictionary of high-frequency components. The proposed architecture is evaluated against classical INR architectures on realistic synthetic data, showing much better accuracy. Its mapping learning performance is explained based on the approximated channel model, highlighting the explainability of the model-based machine learning paradigm.</description>
