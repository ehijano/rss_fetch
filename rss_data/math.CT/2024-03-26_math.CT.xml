      <title>D-inverse constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an algebraic characterisation of ordered groupoids, namely, we show that there is a categorical isomophism between the category of ordered groupoids and the category of $D$-inverse constellations. Here constellations are partial algebras in the sense that they possess a partial product, and a unary operation $D$. We consider constellations in which elements have a suitable notion of inverse, giving the notion of a D-inverse constellation.</description>

      <title>Neural category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neural code on $ n $ neurons is a collection of subsets of the set $ [n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\} $. Curto et al. \cite{curto2013neural} associated a ring $\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{C}}$ (neural ring) to a neural code $\mathcal{C}$. A special class of ring homomorphisms between two neural rings, called neural ring homomorphism, was introduced by Curto and Youngs \cite{curto2020neural}. The main work in this paper comprises constructing two categories. First is the $\mathfrak{C}$ category, a subcategory of SETS consisting of neural codes and code maps. Second is the neural category $\mathfrak{N}$, a subcategory of \textit{Rngs} consisting of neural rings and neural ring homomorphisms. Then, the rest of the paper characterizes the properties of these two categories like initial and final objects, products, coproducts, limits, etc. Also, we show that these two categories are in dual equivalence.</description>

      <title>Uniform Preorders and Partial Combinatory Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform preorders are a class of combinatory representations of Set-indexed preorders that generalize Pieter Hofstra's basic relational objects. An indexed preorder is representable by a uniform preorder if and only if it has as generic predicate. We study the $\exists$-completion of indexed preorders on the level of uniform preorders, and identify a combinatory condition (called 'relational completeness') which characterizes those uniform preorders with finite meets whose $\exists$-completions are triposes. The class of triposes obtained this way contains relative realizability triposes, for which we derive a characterization as a fibrational analogue of the characterization of realizability toposes given in earlier work.
  Besides relative partial combinatory algebras, the class of relationally complete uniform preorders contains filtered ordered partial combinatory algebras, and it is unclear if there are any others.</description>

      <title>Bass-Serre theory for groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.09576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper a Bass-Serre theory in the groupoid setting is developed and a structure theorem is established. Any groupoid action without inversion of edges on a forest induces a graph of groupoids, while any graph of groupoids satisfying certain hypothesis admits a canonical associated groupoid, called the fundamental groupoid, and a forest, called the Bass-Serre forest, such that the fundamental groupoid acts on the Bass-Serre forest. The structure theorem states that these processes are mutually inverse.</description>

      <title>A Quillen model structure of local homotopy equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.02979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we construct a closed model structure on the category of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-graded complexes of projective systems of ind-Banach spaces. When the base field is the fraction field $F$ of a complete discrete valuation ring $V$, the homotopy category of this model structure is the derived category of the quasi-abelian category $\overleftarrow{\mathsf{Ind}(\mathsf{Ban}_F)}$. This homotopy category is the appropriate target of the local and analytic cyclic homology theories for complete, torsionfree $V$-algebras and $\mathbb{F}$-algebras. When the base field is $\mathbb{C}$, the homotopy category is the target of local and analytic cyclic homology for pro-bornological $\mathbb{C}$-algebras, which includes the subcategory of pro-$C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Homotopy cofinality for Non-Abelian homology of group diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01726v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a homotopy cofinal functor between small categories induces a weak equivalence between homotopy colimits of pointed simplicial sets. This is used to prove that the non-Abelian homology of a group diagram is isomorphic to the homology of its inverse image under a homotopy cofinal functor. This also made it possible to establish that the non-Abelian homology of group diagrams are invariant under the left Kan extension along virtual discrete cofibrations. With the help of these results, we have constructed a non-Abelian Gabriel-Zisman homology theory for simplicial sets with coefficients in group diagrams. Moreover, we have generalized this theory to presheaves over an arbitrary small category, which play the role of simplicial sets. Sufficient conditions are found for the isomorphism of non-Abelian homology of presheaves over a small category with coefficients in group diagrams. It is proved that the non-Abelian homology of the factorization category for the small category is isomorphic to the Baues-Wirsching homology. A condition is found under which a functor between small categories induces an isomorphism of non-Abelian Baues-Wirsching homology.</description>
