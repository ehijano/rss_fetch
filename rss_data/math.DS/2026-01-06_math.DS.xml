      <title>Polynomial towers and inverse Gowers theory for bounded-exponent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop Host--Kra and inverse Gowers theory for abelian groups of bounded exponent. We show that the Host--Kra factors $Z^{\leq k}(\mathrm{X})$ associated with actions of such groups admit extensions with the structure of \emph{polynomial towers}. This new notion is a system obtained as a finite iteration of abelian extensions of the trivial system by polynomial cocycles; crucially, the intermediate extensions in this system are not required to agree with the Host--Kra factors. We prove that all such extensions are Abramov (generalizing a recent result of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy), but not necessarily Weyl, and have the structure of k-step translational systems.
  Combining this structure theorem with a correspondence principle due to the first and third authors, we derive an inverse theorem for the Gowers norms on finite abelian groups of bounded exponent: large $U^{k+1}$-norm implies large correlation with a polynomial of degree $\le k$ (on the same group), even when the exponent is not square-free or is divisible by small primes. This resolves a conjecture of the first and third authors for such groups, and also answers a question of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy.</description>

      <title>Spatially-Coupled Network RNA Velocities: A Control-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA velocity is an important model that combines cellular spliced and unspliced RNA counts to infer dynamical properties of various regulatory functions. Despite its wide applicability and many variants used in practice, the model has not been adequately designed to directly account for both intracellular gene regulatory network interactions and spatial intercellular communications. Here, we propose a new RNA velocity approach that jointly and directly captures two new network structures: an intracellular gene regulatory network (GRN) and an intercellular interaction network that captures interactions between (neighboring) cells, with relevance to spatial transcriptomics. We theoretically analyze this two-level network system through the lens of control and consensus theory. In particular, we investigate network equilibria, stability, cellular network consensus, and optimal control approaches for targeted drug intervention.</description>

      <title>The homoclinic structure of generic sectional-hyperbolic classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of sectional-hyperbolicity is a weakened form of hyperbolicity introduced for vector fields in order to understand the dynamic behavior of certain higher-dimensional systems such as the multidimensional Lorenz attractor. In this paper we explore the questions proposed in [\emph{Math. Z.}, \textbf{298} (2021), 469-488] and we provide an affirmative answer by proving that $C^1$-generic non-trivial sectional-hyperbolic chain-recurrent class is robustly a homoclinic class.
  We then apply our findings to the dynamics of star flows providing a positive answer to Conjecture 1.2 in [\emph{Tran. Amer. Math. Soc.} \textbf{376} (2023), 6845-6871]. We remark that our arguments do not assume Lyapunov stability.</description>

      <title>Chaos and Synchronization in Financial Leverages Dynamics: Modeling Systemic Risk with Coupled Unimodal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systemic financial risk refers to the simultaneous failure or destabilization of multiple financial institutions, often triggered by contagion mechanisms or common exposures to shocks. In this paper, we present a dynamical model of bank leverage (the ratio of asset holdings to equity) a quantity that both reflects and drives risk dynamics. We model how banks, constrained by Value-at-Risk (VaR) regulations, adjust their leverage in response to changes in the price of a single asset, assumed to be held in fixed proportion across banks. This leverage-targeting behavior introduces a procyclical feedback loop between asset prices and leverage. In the dynamics, this can manifest as logistic-like behavior with a rich bifurcation structure across model parameters. By analyzing these coupled dynamics in both isolated and interconnected bank models, we outline a framework for understanding how systemic risk can emerge from seemingly rational micro-level behavior.</description>

      <title>On existence, uniqueness and numerical approximation of impulsive differential equations with adaptive state-dependent delays using equations with piecewise-constant arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a class of impulsive nonlinear differential equations with adaptive state-dependent delays. We discuss the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the initial value problem using a Picard-Lindel\"of type argument where we define approximate solutions with the help of equations with piecewise-constant arguments (EPCAs). Moreover, we show that the solutions of the associated EPCAs approximate the solutions of the original impulsive DDE with adaptive state-dependent delay uniformly on compact time intervals. The key assumption underlying both results is that the delayed time function is monotone, or piecewise strictly monotone.</description>

      <title>Tameness of actions on finite rank median algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In compact finite-rank median algebras, we prove that the geometric rank equals the independence number of all continuous median-preserving functions to $[0,1]$. Combined with Rosenthal's dichotomy, this yields a generalized Helly selection principle: for Boolean-tame (e.g., finite-rank) median algebras, the space of median-preserving functions to $[0,1]$ is sequentially compact in the pointwise topology. Using the Bourgain-Fremlin-Talagrand theorem, we show that the set $\mathcal{BV}_r(X,[0,1])$ of $r$-bounded variation functions is a Rosenthal compact for every compact metrizable finite-rank median algebra $X$. Generalizing joint results with E. Glasner on dendrons (rank-1), we establish that every continuous action of a topological group $G$ by median automorphisms on a finite-rank compact median algebra is Rosenthal representable, hence dynamically tame. As an application, the Roller-Fioravanti compactification of any finite-rank topological median $G$-algebra with compact intervals is a dynamically tame $G$-system.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we build surrogate solvers that train on small domains but scale to larger ones without intrusive access to PDE operators? Inspired by the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM) framework for modular data-driven solvers, we propose the Latent Space Element Method (LSEM), an element-based latent surrogate assembly approach in which a learned subdomain ("element") model can be tiled and coupled to form a larger computational domain. Each element is a LaSDI latent ODE surrogate trained from snapshots on a local patch, and neighboring elements are coupled through learned directional interaction terms in latent space, avoiding Schwarz iterations and interface residual evaluations. A smooth window-based blending reconstructs a global field from overlapping element predictions, yielding a scalable assembled latent dynamical system. Experiments on the 1D Burgers and Korteweg-de Vries equations show that LSEM maintains predictive accuracy while scaling to spatial domains larger than those seen in training. LSEM offers an interpretable and extensible route toward foundation-model surrogate solvers built from reusable local models.</description>

      <title>Singular basins in multiscale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world complex systems often evolve on different timescales and possess multiple coexisting stable states. Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. In this Letter, we show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of universal singular funnels. We use the term singular basins to refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels. We show that singular basins occur robustly in a range of dynamical systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly changing parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different parts of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the resilience of the system to disturbances. Crucially, the presence of a singular funnel may prevent the usual dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination or time-averaging of the fast variables</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply thermodynamic formalism to a generalized horseshoe map. We prove that a tailored anisotropic Banach space with weighted norms yields a spectral gap for the transfer operator, implying the existence of a unique physical measure. Under the virtually expanding condition, this measure is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure, with density in the Sobolev space $H_\mu$, for some $\mu&lt;1/2$.</description>

      <title>Feedback control of twisted states in the Kuramoto model on nearest neighbor and complete simple graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study feedback control of twisted states in the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators defined on deterministic nearest neighbor graphs containing complete simple ones when it may have phase-lag. Bifurcations of such twisted solutions in the continuulimit (CL) for the uncontrolled KM defined on nearest neighbor graphs that may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse were discussed very recently by using the center manifold reduction, which is a standard technique in dynamical systems theory. In this paper we analyze the stability and bifurcations of twisted solutions in the CL for the KM subjected to feedback control. In particular, it is shown that the twisted solutions exist and can be stabilized not only for nearest neighbor graphs but also for complete simple graphs. Moreover, the CL is shown to suffer bifurcations at which the twisted solutions becomes unstable and a stable one-parameter family of modulated or oscillating twisted solutions is born, depending on whether the phase-lag is zero or not. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the feedback controlled KM on deterministic nearest neighbor and complete simple graphs.</description>

      <title>A Modified SIS Epidemic Model with Application to Health Insurance Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a modified version of the classical SIS model that incorporates hospitalization for treatment and disease-induced mortality, aiming to more accurately capture the dynamics relevant to health insurance pricing models. More precisely, we introduce a new framework, referred to as the SISHD model, which considers both hospitalized individuals and disease-induced mortality. Dynamical properties of the proposed model are thoroughly analyzed, including positivity and boundedness of the solutions, the basic reproduction number, the existence and asymptotic stability of equilibrium points. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed model in the context of health insurance pricing, where the population sizes estimated from the SISHD model are used to determine appropriate insurance costs. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate and validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity, global symplectification and the stability of Dry Ten Martini Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any fixed irrational frequency and trigonometric-polynomial potential, we show that every type I energy with positive Lyapunov exponent that satisfies the gap-labelling condition is a boundary of an open spectral gap. As a corollary, for the almost-Mathieu operator in the supercritical regime the "all spectral gaps are open" property is robust under a small trigonometric-polynomial perturbation at any irrational frequency. The proof introduces a geometric, all-frequency approach built from three ingredients: (i) the projective action on the Lagrangian Grassmannian and an associated fibred rotation number, (ii) monotonicity of one-parameter families of (Hermitian) symplectic cocycles, and (iii) a partially hyperbolic splitting with a two-dimensional center together with a global symplectification (holonomy-driven parallel transport). This provides a partial resolution to the stability of the Dry Ten Martini Problem in the supercritical regime, and answers a question by M. Shamis regarding the survival of periodic gaps.</description>

      <title>A-PINN: Auxiliary Physics-informed Neural Networks for Structural Vibration Analysis in Continuous Euler-Bernoulli Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their variants have garnered substantial focus from researchers due to their effectiveness in solving both forward and inverse problems governed by differential equations. In this research, a modified Auxiliary physics-informed neural network (A-PINN) framework with balanced adaptive optimizers is proposed for the analysis of structural vibration problems. In order to accurately represent structural systems, it is critical for capturing vibration phenomena and ensuring reliable predictive analysis. So, our investigations are crucial for gaining deeper insight into the robustness of scientific machine learning models for solving vibration problems. Further, to rigorously evaluate the performance of A-PINN, we conducted different numerical simulations to approximate the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations under the various scenarios. The numerical results substantiate the enhanced performance of our model in terms of both numerical stability and predictive accuracy. Our model shows improvement of at least 40% over the baselines.</description>

      <title>On oscillator death in the Winfree model I: the one-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for the standard sinusoidal Winfree model, a coupling strength exceeding twice the maximal magnitude of the intrinsic frequencies guarantees the convergence of the system for Lebesgue almost every initial data. This is proven by first showing, via an order parameter bootstrapping argument, that the pathwise critical coupling strength is upper bounded by a function of the order parameter, and then showing by a volumetric argument that for Lebesgue almost every data the order parameter cannot stay below and be bounded away from 1 for all time; this is a Winfree model counterpart of the analysis of Ha and the author (2020) performed for the Kuramoto model. Using concentration of measure and the aforementioned volumetric argument, we show that, except possibly on a set of very small measure, oscillator death is observed in finite time; this rigorously demonstrates the existence of the oscillator death regime numerically observed by Ariaratnam and Strogatz (2001). These results are robust under many other choices of interaction functions often considered for the Winfree model. We demonstrate that the asymptotic dynamics described in this paper are sharp by analyzing the equilibria of the Winfree model, and we bound the total number of equilibria using a polynomial description. The sequel to this paper will deal with the Winfree model on higher-dimensional manifolds, such as the Euclidean spheres and the unitary groups.</description>

      <title>On IDA-PBC with Maximum Energy Shapeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) is a well-established stabilization technique for affine nonlinear systems. However, its application is generally hindered by the requirement of solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs), i.e., the so-called matching equation. This paper introduces the notion of \emph{maximum energy shapeability} which describes the scenario that the homogeneous part of the matching equation admits $m$ independent solutions with $m$ the dimension of the control input. We demonstrate that the maximum energy shapeability enables a systematic procedure for the IDA-PBC design by transforming the matching equation into a set of easier-to-solve PDEs. Sufficient conditions for maximum energy shapeability are also provided. It is shown that some existing constructive IDA-PBC designs actually implicitly exploit the maximum energy shapeability. The proposed procedure for the IDA-PBC design is illustrated with the magnetic levitation system.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Thrust Regulation in Solid-fuel Ramjet with Variable Geometry Inlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the application of a novel data-driven adaptive control technique, dynamic mode adaptive control (DMAC), to regulate thrust in a solid-fuel ramjet (SFRJ). A quasi-static one-dimensional model of SFRJ with a variable geometry inlet is developed to compute thrust. An adaptive tracking controller is then designed using the DMAC framework, which leverages dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the local system behavior, followed by a tracking controller designed around the identified model. Simulation results demonstrate that DMAC achieves accurate thrust regulation across a range of commanded profiles and operating conditions, without requiring an analytical model of the SFRJ. These findings indicate that DMAC provides a reliable and effective approach for model-free thrust regulation in an SFRJ with variable-geometry inlets as the control input.</description>

      <title>Allostery Beyond Amplification: Temporal Regulation of Signaling Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of protein regulation and is commonly interpreted as modulating enzymatic activity or product abundance. Here we show that this view is incomplete. Using a stochastic model of allosteric regulation combined with an information-theoretic analysis, we quantify the mutual information between an enzyme's regulatory state and the states of downstream signaling components. Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We endow the space of projective filling geodesic currents on a closed hyperbolic surface with a natural asymmetric metric extending Thurston's asymmetric metric on Teichm\"uller space, as well as analogous metrics arising from Hitchin representations. More generally, we show that this metric extends beyond surface groups and geodesic currents, and encompasses metrics associated with Anosov representations of Gromov hyperbolic groups. We identify the horofunction compactification of the space of projective filling currents equipped with this metric with the space of projective geodesic currents. As a consequence, we obtain a rigidity result: the metric spaces of projective filling geodesic currents associated with closed surfaces of distinct genera are not isometric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the merry-go-round fictitious forces are acting like centrifugal force and Coriolis force. Like the Lorentz force Coriolis force is velocity dependent and, following Arnold, can be modeled by twisting the symplectic form. If the merry-go-round is accelerated an additional fictitious force shows up, the Euler force.
  In this article we explain how one deals symplectically with the Euler force by considering time-dependent symplectic forms. It will turn out that to treat the Euler force one also needs time-dependent primitives of the time-dependent symplectic forms.</description>

      <title>Approximating normally attracting invariant manifolds using trajectory-based optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical simulation of realistic reactive flows is a major challenge due to the stiffness and high dimension of the corresponding kinetic differential equations. Manifold-based model reduction techniques address this problem by projecting the full phase space onto manifolds of slow motion, which capture the system's long-term behavior. In this article we study the trajectory-based optimization approach by Lebiedz (2004), which determines these manifolds as minimizers of an appropriate entropy functional. Similar to other methods in this field, this approach is based on physical and geometric intuition and was tested on several models. This article provides a rigorous explanation for its effectiveness, showing how it approximates nonuniformly normally attracting orbits. It also outlines how the method can be utilized to approximate nonuniformly normally attracting invariant manifolds of higher dimension. Throughout the article we use a coordinate-free formulation on a Riemannian manifold. This is especially useful for systems subject to nonlinear constraints, e.g., adiabatic constraints.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Linear Behavior in Large-Scale Dynamical Systems via Spatial Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various natural and engineered systems, from urban traffic flow to the human brain, can be described by large-scale networked dynamical systems. These systems are similar in being comprised of a large number of microscopic subsystems, each with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions, that collectively give rise to different forms of macroscopic dynamics. Despite significant research, why and how various forms of macroscopic dynamics emerge from underlying micro-dynamics remains largely unknown. In this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics. By extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that \textit{in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that, in addition to technical assumptions, pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity}. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked dynamical systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22663v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bifurcations of twisted solutions in a continuum limit (CL) for the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators defined on nearest neighbor graphs, which may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse, when it may have phase-lag. We use the center manifold reduction, which is a standard technique in dynamical systems theory, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of twisted solutions becomes unstable and a stable or unstable two-parameter family of modulated twisted solutions that oscillate or not depending on whether the phase-lag exists or not is born. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM on deterministic dense, random dense and random sparse graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of parametrized non-homogeneous linear complex differential equations on $[1,\infty)$, depending on a complex parameter within the critical strip. We establish a rigidity phenomenon: Two solutions with the same initial condition equal to $1$, corresponding to two different parameters lying on a horizontal line in the critical strip, cannot both be bounded on $[1,+\infty)$. In particular, when $\Re(w)\neq \tfrac{1}{2}$, the two solutions corresponding respectively to the parameters $w$ and $1-\bar{w}$, both taken with initial condition $1$, cannot be simultaneously bounded. This result provides an answer to the Dynamical Conjecture formulated in arXiv:2112.05521.</description>

      <title>Connecting Orbits in Cooperative McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we extend the framework of monotone dynamical systems to a broad and important class of stochastic equations, namely cooperative McKean-Vlasov SDEs with multiplicative noise. Under a locally dissipative assumption, our main theorem establishes the existence of multiple order-related invariant measures in the the Wasserstein space together with monotone connecting orbits (heteroclinic orbits) between them, with respect to the stochastic order. The presence of such connecting orbits also reveals the unstable nature of those invariant measures appearing as their backward limits, a dynamical feature that has remained largely unexplored in stochastic equations. The framework applies to a wide range of classical models, including granular media equations in double-well and multi-well confining potentials with quadratic interaction, perturbed double-well landscapes, and interacting multi-species population models. Our method is based on building a monotone dynamical system that preserves the stochastic order, achieved through a cone compatible with this order and an extension of the classical Dancer-Hess connecting orbit theorem.</description>

Abstract: We explore distribution questions for rational maps on the projective line $\mathbb{P}^1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ within the framework of arithmetic dynamics, drawing analogies to elliptic curves. Specifically, we investigate counting problems for rational maps $\phi$ of fixed degree $d \geq 2$ with prescribed reduction properties. Our main result establishes that the set of rational maps with minimal resultant has positive density. Additionally, for degree 2 rational maps, we perform explicit computations demonstrating that over $32.7\%$ possess a squarefree, and hence minimal, resultant.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $n$-periodic integral points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we inspect a surprising relationship between the set of $n$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}$ and the coefficient $c$, where $d&gt;2$ is an integer and $n\geq 2$ is any fixed integer. As before, we again wish to study counting problems which are inspired by the exciting advances of Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators on $n$-torsion point-counting in arithmetic statistics, and also by Hutz's conjecture along with Panraksa's work on $n$-periodic rational point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any prime $p\geq 3$ and for any fixed (period) $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $n$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p, c}$ modulo $p$ is unbounded or zero as $c$ tends to infinity. Inspired further by a conjecture of Hutz on any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any prime $p\geq 5$ in arithmetic dynamics, we then also prove that for any fixed (period) $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$, the average number of distinct $n$-periodic integral points of any $\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is $1$ or $2$ or $0$ as $c\to \infty$. Finally, we then apply density, polynomial-counting, number field-counting, and Sato-Tate equidistribution results from arithmetic statistics, and thereby obtaining a stream of counting and statistical results on irreducible polynomials, number fields, and Artin $L$-functions that arise naturally in our polynomial discrete dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>Long-time relative error analysis for linear ordinary differential equations with perturbed initial value</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of initial value perturbations along the solution of a linear ordinary differential equation \( y'(t) = Ay(t) \). This propagation is analyzed using the relative error rather than the absolute error. Our focus is on the long-term behavior of this relative error, which differs significantly from that of the absolute error. The present paper is a practical sequel to the theoretical papers \cite{M1,M2} on the long-time behavior of the relative error: it includes applicative examples and important issues not addressed in \cite{M1,M2}. In addition, the present paper shows that understanding the long-term behavior provides insights into the growth of the relative error over all times, not just at large times. Therefore, it represents a crucial and fundamental aspect of the conditioning of linear ordinary differential equations, with applications in, for example, non-normal dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a pseudo-Anosov contact structure, which admits a type of singular contact form with pseudo-Anosov Reeb flow. We prove that contact homology detects the free homotopy classes of closed orbits of any pseudo-Anosov Reeb flow and that any pseudo-Anosov contact structure is universally tight and torsion free. Many applications are given, including new cases of the Finiteness Conjecture for transitive pseudo-Anosov flows. Our proofs use a flavor of contact homology graded by a free homotopy class of loops, defined for any contact manifold. We establish several properties of this type of contact homology that may be of independent interest.</description>
