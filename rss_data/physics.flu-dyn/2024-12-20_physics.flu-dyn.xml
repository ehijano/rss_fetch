      <title>Short-term wind forecasting via surface pressure measurements: stochastic modeling and sensor placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a short-term wind forecasting framework for predicting real-time variations in atmospheric turbulence based on nacelle-mounted anemometer and ground-level air-pressure measurements. Our approach combines linear stochastic estimation and Kalman filtering algorithms to assimilate and process real-time field measurements with the predictions of a stochastic reduced-order model that is confined to a two-dimensional plane at the hub height of turbines. We bridge the vertical gap between the computational plane of the model at hub height and the measurement plane on the ground using a projection technique that allows us to infer the pressure in one plane from the other. Depending on the quality of this inference, we show that customized variants of the extended and ensemble Kalman filters can be tuned to balance estimation quality and computational speed 1-1.5 diameters ahead and behind leading turbines. In particular, we show how synchronizing the sign of estimates with that of velocity fluctuations recorded at the nacelle can significantly improve the ability to follow temporal variations upwind of the leading turbine. We also propose a convex optimization-based framework for selecting a subset of pressure sensors that achieve a desired level of accuracy relative to the optimal Kalman filter that uses all sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Influence of Diaphragm Dynamics on Shock Wave Propagation in Double-Diaphragm Shock Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock tubes have become indispensable tools for advancing research across diverse fields such as aerodynamics, astrophysics, chemical kinetics, and industrial applications. The present study examines shock velocity variations in double-diaphragm shock tubes and their impact on flow dynamics at the end of the shock tube. Experiments were conducted using helium as the driver gas at 30 bar and argon as the driven gas at 100 Torr, with two different mid-section pressures (4.8 and 18.8 bar). A previous study highlighted two mechanisms governing the shock velocity profile: a higher peak shock velocity in the case of lower mid-section pressure due to stronger shock heating of the mid-section gas, and a second stage of acceleration of the shock wave resulting from the higher mid-section pressure and delayed opening of the first diaphragm. Pressure histories of the mid-section between the two diaphragms and high-speed imaging of the diaphragm-opening process helped validate the mechanisms influencing shock velocity. Additionally, numerical simulations were performed (i) to understand the effect of diaphragm-opening dynamics on the experimental shock profiles and (ii) to quantify the axial temperature as well as pressure profiles within the shocked gas. The simulations revealed that while axial pressure variations were not significantly affected by shock velocity variation, there were large temperature gradients in the shocked gas, with up to 6.5 percent higher peak temperature in the case of lower mid-section pressure compared to its counterpart. These pivotal findings underscore the need to control the mid-section pressure to minimize temperature variations within the shocked gas region.</description>

      <title>Reaction-limited evaporation for the color-gradient lattice Boltzmann model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to achieve reaction-limited evaporation for the color-gradient lattice Boltzmann multicomponent model. Our approach involves a systematic way to remove fluid mass from the interface region in order to achieve evaporation rates similar to those in a reaction-limited regime. Through various tests, our method demonstrates accurate and consistent results for different interface shapes across a wide range of evaporation flux magnitudes. A single free parameter is required to choose the evaporation sites where fluid mass is exchanged between the components. We find that at unit density ratio, this single parameter allows for the correct description of an arbitrarily shaped interface with an error of less than 5%. For density contrasts, accurate results are observed for lower evaporation flux magnitudes and density ratios. Our proposed method can be applied to isothermal reaction-limited scenarios, such as evaporation in pure vapor or under a gas draft. It can also handle weakly space-time-dependent fluxes, making it suitable for specific non-isothermal applications such as drop evaporation from heated substrates.</description>

      <title>Turbulent dissipative coupling in nanoscale multimode superfluid acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluid helium, the inviscid low-temperature phase of liquid \4He, enables investigation of flows with reduced dimensionality since, due to the vanishing viscosity, sub-micron flow channels can be constructed. In such strongly confined volumes filled with superfluid, the longitudinal acoustic wave is a coupled fluctuation of pressure and entropy density called fourth sound. In this work, we use multiple 4th sound acoustic modes inside a nano-superfluidic acoustic resonator in a pump-probe arrangement to observe localized clusters of quantized vortices leading to two-dimensional turbulence. The localised turbulence enables controllable and asymmetric dissipative coupling between acoustic modes. Furthermore, we derive a general procedure for analytically estimating the superfluid acoustic resonance frequencies inside a volume with mechanically compliant walls. Our work confirms earlier assumptions that turbulence in similar nanofluidic systems initially develops in localized areas of high shear. The multimode pump-probe methods presented here will allow future experiments to study the dynamics of two-dimensional quantum turbulence, e.g., the free decay.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of a Water Droplet onto a Horizontally Vibrating Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of three-dimensional turbulence under a free surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many environmental flows, an air-water free surface interacts with a turbulent flow in the water phase. To mimic this situation, we propose an original experimental setup, based on the Randomly Actuated Synthetic Jet Array (RASJA) forcing used to study turbulence with almost no mean flow. By using a central pump connected to jets, we generate a turbulent flow of tunable intensity, with good isotropy and horizontal homogeneity, up to a maximal turbulent Reynolds number of $8800$. The aim here is to characterize how turbulence is modified by the presence of a free surface. We show that the free surface affects turbulence for fluid depths smaller than the integral length. We report that the turbulent fluctuations become strongly anisotropic when approaching the free surface. The vertical velocity fluctuations decrease close to the surface whereas the horizontal ones increase, as reported in previous theoretical predictions and numerical observations. We also observe a strong enhancement of the amplitude of the temporal and spatial power spectra of the horizontal velocity at large scales, showing the strengthening of these velocity fluctuations near the free surface. Besides, these behaviors are studied for various levels of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Covering convection with thermal blankets: fluid-structure interactions in thermal convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continental plates of Earth are known to drift over a geophysical timescale, and their interactions have lead to some of the most spectacular geoformations of our planet while also causing natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic activity. Understanding the dynamics of interacting continental plates is thus significant. In this work, we present a fluid mechanical investigation of the plate motion, interaction, and dynamics. Through numerical experiments, we examine the coupling between a convective fluid and plates floating on top of it. With physical modeling, we show the coupling is both mechanical and thermal, leading to the thermal blanket effect: the floating plate is not only transported by the fluid flow beneath, it also prevents the heat from leaving the fluid, leading to a convective flow that further affects the plate motion. By adding several plates to such a coupled fluid-structure interaction, we also investigate how floating plates interact with each other and show that, under proper conditions, small plates can converge into a supercontinent.</description>

      <title>On the Energy Spectrum of Non-Newtonian Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to propose a theoretical framework to study homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in a viscoelastic fluid, regarded as a perturbation of a Newtonian incompressible fluid, where the fluid relaxation time, or else the Weissenberg number, plays the role of small parameter. We use a Martin-Siggia-Rose framework to obtain a formal expression for the velocity correlation function of the non-Newtonian flow, and we expand this formal expression to linear order in the relaxation time. The coefficients in this expansion are correlation functions of the base Newtonian flow. We do not derive these correlations, instead we replace them by their values according to K41 theory, which could be regarded as an extreme form of renormalization. While substantial work will be necessary to validate the model against numerical and experimental data, preliminary results are encouraging.</description>

      <title>Coherent Structures Governing Transport at Turbulent Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an experiment on a turbulent jet, we detect interfacial turbulent layers in a frame that moves, on average, along with the \tnti. This significantly prolongs the observation time of scalar and velocity structures and enables the measurement of two types of Lagrangian coherent structures. One structure, the finite-time Lyapunov field (FTLE), quantifies advective transport barriers of fluid parcels while the other structure highlights barriers of diffusive momentum transport. These two complementary structures depend on large-scale and small-scale motion and are therefore associated with the growth of the turbulent region through engulfment or nibbling, respectively. We detect the \tnti\ from cluster analysis, where we divide the measured scalar field into four clusters. Not only the \tnti\ can be found this way, but also the next, internal, turbulent-turbulent interface. Conditional averages show that these interfaces are correlated with barriers of advective and diffusive transport when the Lagrangian integration time is smaller than the integral time scale. Diffusive structures decorrelate faster since they have a smaller timescale. Conditional averages of these structures at internal turbulent-turbulent interfaces show the same pattern with a more pronounced jump at the interface indicative of a shear layer. This is quite an unexpected outcome, as the internal interface is now defined not by the presence or absence of vorticity, but by conditional vorticity corresponding to two uniform concentration zones. The long-time diffusive momentum flux along Lagrangian paths represents the growth of the turbulent flow into the irrotational domain, a direct demonstration of nibbling. The diffusive flux parallel to the \tnti\ appears to be concentrated in a diffusive superlayer whose width is comparable with the Taylor microscale, which is relatively invariant in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Madelung transformation on a generalized scalar Gross-Pitaevski equation, a nonlinear continuum fluid equations are derived for a classical fluid. A unitary quantum lattice algorithm is then determined as a second order discrete representation of this Gross-Pitaevski equation and the simulations are compared to those using classical fluid dynamic techniques.</description>
