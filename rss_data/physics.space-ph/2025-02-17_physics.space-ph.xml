      <title>Analysis of 42 years of Cosmic Ray Measurements by the Neutron Monitor at Lomnick\'y st\'it Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation and physical interconnection between space weather indices and cosmic ray flux has been well-established with extensive literature on the topic. Our investigation is centered on the relationships among the solar radio flux, geomagnetic field activity, and cosmic ray flux, as observed by the Neutron Monitor at the Lomnick\'y \v{s}t\'it Observatory in Slovakia. We processed the raw neutron monitor data, generating the first publicly accessible dataset spanning 42 years. The curated continuous data are available in .csv format in hourly resolution from December 1981 to July 2023 and in minute resolution from January 2001 to July 2023 (Institute of Experimental Physics SAS, 2024). Validation of this processed data was accomplished by identifying distinctive events within the dataset. As part of the selection of events for case studies, we report the discovery of TGE-s visible in the data. Applying the Pearson method for statistical analysis, we quantified the linear correlation of the datasets. Additionally, a prediction power score was computed to reveal potential non-linear relationships. Our findings demonstrate a significant anti-correlation between cosmic ray and solar radio flux with a correlation coefficient of -0.74, coupled with a positive correlation concerning geomagnetic field strength. We also found that the neutron monitor measurements correlate better with a delay of 7-21 hours applied to the geomagnetic field strength data. The correlation between these datasets is further improved when inspecting periods of extreme solar events only. Lastly, the computed prediction power score of 0.22 for neutron flux in the context of geomagnetic field strength presents exciting possibilities for developing real-time geomagnetic storm prediction models based on cosmic ray measurements.</description>

      <title>Acceleration noise due to Space Magnetic Field for Heliocentric Gravitational Wave Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-borne gravitational wave observatory is to detect low-frequency gravitational wave signals in the range of 0.1 mHz to 100 mHz. The inertial sensors of space gravitational wave require very high accuracy for acceleration noise, and the interaction of the space magnetic field with the test mass can generate magnetic moment forces and Lorentz forces, which lead to acceleration noise. Here, we obtain space magnetic field data from OMNI during 25 years from 1998 to 2022. And accordingly, we calculate the acceleration noise of space magnetic field of a heliocentric gravitational wave observatory, LISA, in more than 2 solar activity cycles. Then, we obtain the amplitude spectral densities of the acceleration noise for each day of the 25 years. We find that the median of the space magnetic field acceleration noise of LISA at 1 mHz is about $1 \times \rm 10^{-17}~m s^{-2}~Hz^{-1/2}$. We compare the space magnetic field acceleration noise of LISA and a geocentric gravitational wave observatory, TianQin, and find that the acceleration noise of the space magnetic field is of comparable magnitude for TianQin and LISA, and neither of them exceeds the respective acceleration noise requirements. Based on the statistical result of space magnetic field acceleration noise in more than 2 solar cycles, we give the $\chi$--$\xi$ parameters map of the TM for LISA and TianQin, and find that TianQin has a more stringent requirement of the parameters design than that of LISA.</description>

      <title>First observations of a geomagnetic superstorm with a sub-L1 monitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting the geomagnetic effects of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is currently an unsolved problem. CMEs, responsible for the largest values of the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field, are the key driver of intense and extreme geomagnetic activity. Observations of southward interplanetary magnetic fields are currently only accessible directly through in situ measurements by spacecraft in the solar wind. On 10-12 May 2024, the strongest geomagnetic storm since 2003 took place, caused by five interacting CMEs. We clarify the relationship between the CMEs, their solar source regions, and the resulting signatures at the Sun-Earth L1 point observed by the ACE spacecraft at 1.00 AU. The STEREO-A spacecraft was situated at 0.956 AU and 12.6{\deg} west of Earth during the event, serving as a fortuitous sub-L1 monitor providing interplanetary magnetic field measurements of the solar wind. We demonstrate an extension of the prediction lead time, as the shock was observed 2.57 hours earlier at STEREO-A than at L1, consistent with the measured shock speed at L1, 710 km/s, and the radial distance of 0.04 AU. By deriving the geomagnetic indices based on the STEREO-A beacon data, we show that the strength of the geomagnetic storm would have been decently forecasted, with the modeled minimum SYM-H=-478.5 nT, underestimating the observed minimum by only 8%. Our study sets an unprecedented benchmark for future mission design using upstream monitoring for space weather prediction.</description>
