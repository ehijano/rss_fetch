      <title>Entangling four logical qubits beyond break-even in a nonlocal code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction protects logical quantum information against environmental decoherence by encoding logical qubits into entangled states of physical qubits. One of the most important near-term challenges in building a scalable quantum computer is to reach the break-even point, where logical quantum circuits on error-corrected qubits achieve higher fidelity than equivalent circuits on uncorrected physical qubits. Using Quantinuum's H2 trapped-ion quantum processor, we encode the GHZ state in four logical qubits with fidelity $ 99.5 \pm 0.15 \% \le F \le 99.7 \pm 0.1\% $ (after postselecting on over 98% of outcomes). Using the same quantum processor, we can prepare an uncorrected GHZ state on four physical qubits with fidelity $97.8 \pm 0.2 \% \le F\le 98.7\pm 0.2\%$. The logical qubits are encoded in a $[\![ 25,4,3 ]\!]$ Tanner-transformed long-range-enhanced surface code. Logical entangling gates are implemented using simple swap operations. Our results are a first step towards realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation with logical qubits encoded in geometrically nonlocal quantum low-density parity check codes.</description>

      <title>Latent Style-based Quantum GAN for high-quality Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum generative modeling is among the promising candidates for achieving a practical advantage in data analysis. Nevertheless, one key challenge is to generate large-size images comparable to those generated by their classical counterparts. In this work, we take an initial step in this direction and introduce the Latent Style-based Quantum GAN (LaSt-QGAN), which employs a hybrid classical-quantum approach in training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for arbitrary complex data generation. This novel approach relies on powerful classical auto-encoders to map a high-dimensional original image dataset into a latent representation. The hybrid classical-quantum GAN operates in this latent space to generate an arbitrary number of fake features, which are then passed back to the auto-encoder to reconstruct the original data. Our LaSt-QGAN can be successfully trained on realistic computer vision datasets beyond the standard MNIST, namely Fashion MNIST (fashion products) and SAT4 (Earth Observation images) with 10 qubits, resulting in a comparable performance (and even better in some metrics) with the classical GANs. Moreover, we analyze the barren plateau phenomena within this context of the continuous quantum generative model using a polynomial depth circuit and propose a method to mitigate the detrimental effect during the training of deep-depth networks. Through empirical experiments and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the potential of LaSt-QGAN for the practical usage in the context of image generation and open the possibility of applying it to a larger dataset in the future.</description>

      <title>A generalized cycle benchmarking algorithm for characterizing mid-circuit measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurement (MCM) is a crucial ingredient in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While there have been rapid experimental progresses in realizing MCM, a systematic method for characterizing noisy MCM is still under exploration. In this work we develop an algorithm to characterize noisy MCM, via a generalization of cycle benchmarking -- a standard approach for characterizing the Pauli noise channel of Clifford gates. The key idea is to use a joint Fourier transform on the classical and quantum registers and then estimate parameters in the Fourier space, analogous to Pauli fidelities used in cycle benchmarking. Furthermore, we develop a theory of the noise learnability of MCM, which determines what information can be learned about the noise model (in the presence of state preparation and measurement noise) and what cannot, which shows that all learnable information can be learned using our algorithm. As an application, we show how to use the learned information to test the independence between measurement noise and state preparation noise in a MCM. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to illustrate the practical applicability of the algorithm. Similar to cycle benchmarking, we expect the algorithm to provide a useful toolkit that is of experimental interest.</description>

      <title>Optimization of decoder priors for accurate quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate decoding of quantum error-correcting codes is a crucial ingredient in protecting quantum information from decoherence. It requires characterizing the error channels corrupting the logical quantum state and providing this information as a prior to the decoder. We introduce a reinforcement learning inspired method for calibrating these priors that aims to minimize the logical error rate. Our method significantly improves the decoding accuracy in repetition and surface code memory experiments executed on Google's Sycamore processor, outperforming the leading decoder-agnostic method by 16% and 3.3% respectively. This calibration approach will serve as an important tool for maximizing the performance of both near-term and future error-corrected quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled continuous microwave-to-optics frequency conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum interface between microwave and optical photons is essential for entangling remote superconducting quantum processors. To preserve fragile quantum states, a transducer must operate efficiently while generating less than one photon of noise referred to its input. Here, we present a platform that meets these criteria, utilizing a combination of electrostatic and optomechanical interactions in devices made entirely from crystalline silicon. This platform's small mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption enable ground-state radiative cooling, resulting in quantum-enabled operation with a continuous laser drive. Under the optimal settings for high efficiency (low noise), we measure an external efficiency of $2.2\%$ ($0.47\%$) and an input-referred added noise of $0.94$ ($0.58$) in microwave-to-optics conversion. We quantify the transducer throughput using the efficiency-bandwidth product, finding it exceeds previous demonstrations with similar noise performance by approximately two orders of magnitude, thereby paving a practical path to interconnecting remote superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based architecture search for quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages the large Hilbert space provided by quantum computing for data encoding, typically realized by parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). While classical machine learning deals extensively with problem-specific model design, QML models mainly use hardwareefficient and heuristic circuit designs for PQCs. This work presents a novel approach employing the reinforcement learning algorithm MuZero to generate problem-specific PQCs to improve the QML performance. Diverging from previous search algorithms, we adopt a layered circuit design to significantly reduce the search space. Furthermore, we utilize cross-validation scoring to train the reinforcement learning algorithm, rewarding the discovery of high-performing circuits. In benchmarks we compare our tailored circuits with reference circuits from the literature, randomly generated circuits, and circuits generated by genetic algorithms. Our findings underscore the efficacy of problem-tailored encoding circuits in enhancing QML model performance.</description>

      <title>Isolation of individual Er quantum emitters in anatase TiO$_2$ on Si photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects and dopant atoms in solid state materials are a promising platform for realizing single photon sources and quantum memories, which are the basic building blocks of quantum repeaters needed for long distance quantum networks. In particular, trivalent erbium (Er$^{3+}$) is of interest because it couples C-band telecom optical transitions with a spin-based memory platform. In order to produce quantum repeaters at the scale required for a quantum internet, it is imperative to integrate these necessary building blocks with mature and scalable semiconductor processes. In this work, we demonstrate the optical isolation of single Er$^{3+}$ ions in CMOS-compatible titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) thin films monolithically integrated on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonics platform. Our results demonstrate a first step toward the realization of a monolithically integrated and scalable quantum photonics package based on Er$^{3+}$ doped thin films.</description>

      <title>The Focked-up ZX Calculus: Picturing Continuous-Variable Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the ZX and ZW calculi have been effective as graphical reasoning tools for finite-dimensional quantum computation, the possibilities for continuous-variable quantum computation (CVQC) in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space are only beginning to be explored. In this work, we formulate a graphical language for CVQC. Each diagram is an undirected graph made of two types of spiders: the Z spider from the ZX calculus defined on the reals, and the newly introduced Fock spider defined on the natural numbers. The Z and X spiders represent functions in position and momentum space respectively, while the Fock spider represents functions in the discrete Fock basis. In addition to the Fourier transform between Z and X, and the Hermite transform between Z and Fock, we present exciting new graphical rules capturing heftier CVQC interactions.
  We ensure this calculus is complete for all of Gaussian CVQC interpreted in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, by translating the completeness in affine Lagrangian relations by Booth, Carette, and Comfort. Applying our calculus for quantum error correction, we derive graphical representations of the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code encoder, syndrome measurement, and magic state distillation of Hadamard eigenstates. Finally, we elucidate Gaussian boson sampling by providing a fully graphical proof that its circuit samples submatrix hafnians.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms and Lower Bounds for Finite-Sum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-sum optimization has wide applications in machine learning, covering important problems such as support vector machines, regression, etc. In this paper, we initiate the study of solving finite-sum optimization problems by quantum computing. Specifically, let $f_1,\ldots,f_n\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ be $\ell$-smooth convex functions and $\psi\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ be a $\mu$-strongly convex proximal function. The goal is to find an $\epsilon$-optimal point for $F(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(\mathbf{x})+\psi(\mathbf{x})$. We give a quantum algorithm with complexity $\tilde{O}\big(n+\sqrt{d}+\sqrt{\ell/\mu}\big(n^{1/3}d^{1/3}+n^{-2/3}d^{5/6}\big)\big)$, improving the classical tight bound $\tilde{\Theta}\big(n+\sqrt{n\ell/\mu}\big)$. We also prove a quantum lower bound $\tilde{\Omega}(n+n^{3/4}(\ell/\mu)^{1/4})$ when $d$ is large enough. Both our quantum upper and lower bounds can extend to the cases where $\psi$ is not necessarily strongly convex, or each $f_i$ is Lipschitz but not necessarily smooth. In addition, when $F$ is nonconvex, our quantum algorithm can find an $\epsilon$-critial point using $\tilde{O}(n+\ell(d^{1/3}n^{1/3}+\sqrt{d})/\epsilon^2)$ queries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network methods have evolved from solving optimization problems in quantum many-body spin systems. While the tensor network is now regarded as a powerful tool in quantum computer simulation, there still exists a complexity issue in updating the tensors. This work studies the tensor updates simplification in the context of the tensor network based quantum computer simulation. According to the numerical simulations, a method called simple update, also originated in quantum many-body spin systems, shows a good balance of the fidelity and the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>An analytical solution of the Schrodinger equation for the neutral ground state Para Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents the analytical solution of the Schrodinger equation and its corresponding wave function for the neutral para-helium or para-helium-like atoms in the ground state. The state functions of the two electrons for s=0 and l=0 as well as their boundary conditions are examined in detail. Furthermore, a method for describing a generic electron potential consisting of Coulomb and exchange interactions is derived, and the resulting potential function is integrated into the Schrodinger equation as a potential term. In addition, the altered electromagnetic coupling of the electrons due to vacuum polarization effects is investigated and finally the Schrodinger equation for the neutral Para-Helium is solved using Laplace transformations. The energy in the ground state is then determined , and it can be shown that this agrees with the literature values given the fact that the electron can be assumed to be a point-like particle. In the context of these investigations, an upper limit estimation for the spatial dimension of the electron can also be given as well as the existence of a minimal distance of a stable bonding state between two electrons, which can be interpreted as an entangled state; in addition, the chemical inertness of helium with regard to chemical reactions-i.e. the principle of the "closed" electron shell-can be made plausible by the quantum mechanical electron configuration and its consequences with regard to binding energy. The wave function found for the helium atom is compared with the known solutions for the hydrogen atom, and essential differences between the two are worked out.</description>

      <title>Dynamical topology of chiral and nonreciprocal state transfers in a non-Hermitian quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental concept underlying topological phenomena posits the geometric phase associated with eigenstates. In contrast to this prevailing notion, theoretical studies on time-varying Hamiltonians allow for a new type of topological phenomenon, known as topological dynamics, where the evolution process allows a hidden topological invariant associated with continuous flows. To validate this conjecture, we study topological chiral and nonreciprocal dynamics by encircling the exceptional points (EPs) of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in a trapped ion system. These dynamics are topologically robust against external perturbations even in the presence dissipation-induced nonadiabatic processes. Our findings indicate that they are protected by dynamical vorticity -- an emerging topological invariant associated with the energy dispersion of non-Hermitian band structures in a parallel transported eigenbasis. The symmetry breaking and other key features of topological dynamics are directly observed through quantum state tomography. Our results mark a significant step towards exploring topological properties of open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's theorem supposedly demonstrates an irreconcilable conflict between quantum mechanics and local, realistic hidden variable theories. In this paper we show that all experiments that aim to prove Bell's theorem do not actually achieve this goal. Our conclusions are based on a straightforward statistical analysis of the outcomes of these experiments. The key tool in our study is probability theory and, in particular, the concept of sample space for the dichotomic random variables that quantifies the outcomes of such experiments. We also show that an experimental proof of Bell's theorem is not, in principle, impossible, but it would require a completely different experimental apparatus than those commonly used to allegedly achieve this objective. The main consequence of our work is that we cannot dismiss local realistic hidden variable theories on the basis of the available experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting travelling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are broadband near-quantum limited microwave amplifiers commonly used for qubit readout and a wide range of other applications in quantum technologies. The performance of these amplifiers depends on achieving impedance matching to minimise reflected signals. Here we apply a microwave calibration technique to extract the S-parameters of a Josephson junction based TWPA in-operando. This enables reflections occurring at the TWPA and its extended network of components to be quantified, and we find that the in-operation performance can be well described by the off-state measured S-parameters.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Neural Network-Based Approach to Power Quality Disturbances Detection and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power quality disturbances (PQDs) significantly impact the stability and reliability of power systems, necessitating accurate and efficient detection and recognition methods. While numerous classical algorithms for PQDs detection and recognition have been extensively studied and applied, related work in the quantum domain is still in its infancy. In this paper, an improved quantum neural networks (QNN) model for PQDs detection and recognition is proposed. Specifically, the model constructs a quantum circuit comprising data qubits and ancilla qubits. Classical data is transformed into quantum data by embedding it into data qubits via the encoding layer. Subsequently, parametric quantum gates are utilized to form the variational layer, which facilitates qubit information transformation, thereby extracting essential feature information for detection and recognition. The expected value is obtained by measuring ancilla qubits, enabling the completion of disturbance classification based on this expected value. An analysis reveals that the runtime and space complexities of the QNN are $O\left ( poly\left ( N \right ) \right )$ and $O\left ( N \right )$, respectively. Extensive experiments validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model in PQD detection and recognition. The model achieves accuracies of 99.75\%, 97.85\% and 95.5\% in experiments involving the detection of disturbances, recognition of seven single disturbances, and recognition of ten mixed disturbances, respectively. Additionally, noise simulation and comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits robust anti-noise capabilities, requires few training parameters, and maintains high accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SilVer (Silq Verification), an automated tool for verifying behaviors of quantum programs written in Silq, which is a high-level programming language for quantum computing. The goal of the verification is to ensure correctness of the Silq quantum program against user-defined specifications using SMT solvers. We introduce a programming model that is based on a quantum RAM-style computer as an interface between Silq programs and SMT proof obligations, allowing for control of quantum operations using both classical and quantum conditions. Additionally, users can employ measurement flags within the specification to easily specify conditions that measurement results require to satisfy for being a valid behavior. We provide case studies on the verification of generating entangled states and multiple oracle-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sub-diffraction estimation, discrimination and learning of quantum states of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resolution of optical imaging is classically limited by the width of the point-spread function, which in turn is determined by the Rayleigh length. Recently, spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) has been proposed as a method to achieve sub-Rayleigh estimation and discrimination of natural, incoherent sources. Here we show that SPADE is optimal in the broader context of machine learning. To this goal, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical image classifier that achieves sub-Rayleigh resolution. The algorithm includes a quantum and a classical part. In the quantum part, a physical device (demultiplexer) is used to sort the transverse field, followed by mode-wise photon detection. This part of the algorithm implements a physical pre-processing of the quantum field that cannot be classically simulated without essentially reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. In the classical part of the algorithm, the collected data are fed into an artificial neural network for training and classification. As a case study, we classify images from the MNIST dataset after severe blurring due to diffraction. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the ability to learn highly blurred images that would be otherwise indistinguishable by direct imaging without the physical pre-processing of the quantum field.</description>

      <title>Approximating dynamical correlation functions with constant depth quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important quantities characterizing the microscopic properties of quantum systems are dynamical correlation functions. These correlations are obtained by time-evolving a perturbation of an eigenstate of the system, typically the ground state. In this work, we study approximations of these correlation functions that do not require time dynamics. We show that having access to a circuit that prepares an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, it is possible to approximate the dynamical correlation functions up to exponential accuracy in the complex frequency domain $\omega=\Re(\omega)+i\Im(\omega)$, on a strip above the real line $\Im(\omega)=0$. We achieve this by exploiting the continued fraction representation of the dynamical correlation functions as functions of frequency $\omega$, where the level $k$ approximant can be obtained by measuring a weight $O(k)$ operator on the eigenstate of interest. In the complex $\omega$ plane, we show how this approach allows to determine approximations to correlation functions with accuracy that increases exponentially with $k$.
  We analyse two algorithms to generate the continuous fraction representation in scalar or matrix form, starting from either one or many initial operators. We prove that these algorithms generate an exponentially accurate approximation of the dynamical correlation functions on a region sufficiently far away from the real frequency axis. We present numerical evidence of these theoretical results through simulations of small lattice systems. We comment on the stability of these algorithms with respect to sampling noise in the context of quantum simulation using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information: Properties and operational interpretation from strong converse exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deepen the study of properties of the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information, which is defined as the minimization of the sandwiched divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite state relative to any product state. In particular, we prove a novel duality relation for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$ by employing Sion's minimax theorem, and we prove additivity for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$. Previously, additivity was only known for $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$, but has been conjectured for $\alpha\in [\frac{1}{2},\infty]$. Furthermore, we show that the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$ attains operational meaning in the context of binary quantum state discrimination as it is linked to certain strong converse exponents.</description>

      <title>Solving Sharp Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial Time Problem by Evolution methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting ground state degeneracy of a $k$-local Hamiltonian is important in many fields of physics. Its complexity belongs to the problem of sharp bounded-error quantum polynomial time (#BQP) class and few methods are known for its solution. Finding ground states of a $k$-local Hamiltonian, on the other hand, is an easier problem of Quantum Merlin Arthur (QMA) class, for which many efficient methods exist. In this work, we propose an algorithm of mapping a #BQP problem into one of finding a special ground state of a $k$-local Hamiltonian. We prove that all traditional methods, which solve the QMA problem by evolution under a function of a Hamiltonian, can be used to find the special ground state from a well-designed initial state, thus can solve the #BQP problem. We combine our algorithm with power method, Lanczos method, and quantum imaginary time evolution method for different systems to illustrate the detection of phase boundaries, competition between frustration and quantum fluctuation, and potential implementations with quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing from Gravity as Universal Dephasing Channel for Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction of a transmon qubit with a classical gravitational field. Exploiting the generic phenomena of the gravitational redshift and Aharonov-Bohm phase, we show that entangled quantum states dephase with a universal rate. The gravitational phase shift is expressed in terms of a quantum computing noise channel. We give a measurement protocol based on a modified phase estimation algorithm which is linear in the phase drift, which is optimal for measuring the small phase that is acquired from the gravitation channel. Additionally, we propose qubit-based platforms as quantum sensors for precision gravitometers and mechanical strain gauges as an example of this phenomenon's utility. We estimate a sensitivity for measuring the local gravitational acceleration to be $\delta g/g \sim 10^{-7}$. This paper demonstrates that classical gravitation has a non-trivial influence on quantum computing hardware, and provides an illustration of how quantum computing hardware may be utilized for purposes other than computation. While we focus on superconducting qubits, we point the universal nature of gravitational phase effects for all quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Variational readout through quantum teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors (GWDs) is constrained at low frequencies by quantum radiation-pressure noise, a manifestation of the measurement's back action. One strategy to mitigate this back action involves employing variational readout, which entails cross-correlating the measurement shot noise with radiation-pressure noise. Prior research has demonstrated that variational readout in GWDs can be accomplished through the use of a filter cavity. However, current gravitational-wave detectors necessitate filter cavity lengths on the order of $\sim 100$ meters, with future detectors anticipated to reach lengths of a few kilometers. This paper introduces a novel approach to variational readout utilizing principle of quantum teleportation, which eliminates the need for a filter cavity. *This document will not be published any journals, since it turned out to be not very useful for the real detectors. The main reason is that one does not need the EPR entanglement to obtain the same result, which does not even shows true variational readout. In other words, both schemes do not exceed the EPR squeezing. Nevertheless this document will be uploaded to stimulate discussions how to realize "true" back action evasion, such as variational readout or speed meter, via quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-limited adaptive gradient estimation for multiple observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, measuring the expectation value of a general observable has an inherent statistical uncertainty that is quantified by variance or mean squared error of measurement outcome. While the uncertainty can be reduced by averaging several samples, the number of samples should be minimized when each sample is very costly. This is especially the case for fault-tolerant quantum computing that involves measurement of multiple observables of non-trivial states in large quantum systems that exceed the capabilities of classical computers. In this work, we provide an adaptive quantum algorithm for estimating the expectation values of $M$ general observables within root mean squared error $\varepsilon$ simultaneously, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\sqrt{M}\log M)$ queries to a state preparation oracle of a target state. This remarkably achieves the scaling of Heisenberg limit $1/\varepsilon$, a fundamental bound on the estimation precision in terms of mean squared error, together with the sublinear scaling of the number of observables $M$. The proposed method is an adaptive version of the quantum gradient estimation algorithm and has a resource-efficient implementation due to its adaptiveness. Specifically, the space overhead in the proposed method is $\mathcal{O}(M)$ which is independent from the estimation precision $\varepsilon$ unlike non-iterative algorithms. In addition, our method can avoid the numerical instability problem for constructing quantum circuits in a large-scale task (e.g., $\varepsilon\ll 1$ in our case), which appears in the actual implementation of many algorithms relying on quantum signal processing techniques. Our method paves a new way to precisely understand and predict various physical properties in complicated quantum systems using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Off-the-Shelf Silicon Chips for Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing demand for quantum computing across various sectors, including finance, materials and studying chemical reactions. A promising implementation involves semiconductor qubits utilizing quantum dots within transistors. While academic research labs currently produce their own devices, scaling this process is challenging, requires expertise, and results in devices of varying quality. Some initiatives are exploring the use of commercial transistors, offering scalability, improved quality, affordability, and accessibility for researchers. This paper delves into potential realizations and the feasibility of employing off-the-shelf commercial devices for qubits. It addresses challenges such as noise, coherence, limited customizability in large industrial fabs, and scalability issues. The exploration includes discussions on potential manufacturing approaches for early versions of small qubit chips. The use of state-of-the-art transistors as hosts for quantum dots, incorporating readout techniques based on charge sensing or reflectometry, and methods like electron shuttling for qubit connectivity are examined. Additionally, more advanced designs, including 2D arrays and crossbar or DRAM-like access arrays, are considered for the path toward accessible quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programming for today's quantum computers is making significant strides toward modern workflows compatible with high performance computing (HPC), but fundamental challenges still remain in the integration of these vastly different technologies. Quantum computing (QC) programming languages share some common ground, as well as their emerging runtimes and algorithmic modalities. In this short paper, we explore avenues of refinement for the quantum processing unit (QPU) in the context of many-tasks management, asynchronous or otherwise, in order to understand the value it can play in linking QC with HPC. Through examples, we illustrate how its potential for scientific discovery might be realized.</description>

      <title>Entangled states are typically incomparable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a bipartite quantum system, where Alice and Bob jointly possess a pure state $|\psi\rangle$. Using local quantum operations on their respective subsystems, and unlimited classical communication, Alice and Bob may be able to transform $|\psi\rangle$ into another state $|\phi\rangle$. Famously, Nielsen's theorem [Phys. Rev. Lett., 1999] provides a necessary and sufficient algebraic criterion for such a transformation to be possible (namely, the local spectrum of $|\phi\rangle$ should majorise the local spectrum of $|\psi\rangle$).
  In the paper where Nielsen proved this theorem, he conjectured that in the limit of large dimensionality, for almost all pairs of states $|\psi\rangle, |\phi\rangle$ (according to the natural unitary invariant measure) such a transformation is not possible. That is to say, typical pairs of quantum states $|\psi\rangle, |\phi\rangle$ are entangled in fundamentally different ways, that cannot be converted to each other via local operations and classical communication.
  Via Nielsen's theorem, this conjecture can be equivalently stated as a conjecture about majorisation of spectra of random matrices from the so-called trace-normalised complex Wishart-Laguerre ensemble. Concretely, let $X$ and $Y$ be independent $n \times m$ random matrices whose entries are i.i.d. standard complex Gaussians; then Nielsen's conjecture says that the probability that the spectrum of $X X^\dagger / \operatorname{tr}(X X^\dagger)$ majorises the spectrum of $Y Y^\dagger / \operatorname{tr}(Y Y^\dagger)$ tends to zero as both $n$ and $m$ grow large. We prove this conjecture, and we also confirm some related predictions of Cunden, Facchi, Florio and Gramegna [J. Phys. A., 2020; Phys. Rev. A., 2021].</description>

      <title>Relative-belief inference in quantum information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the framework of Bayesian relative belief that directly evaluates whether or not the experimental data at hand supports a given hypothesis regarding a quantum system by directly comparing the prior and posterior probabilities for the hypothesis. In model-dimension certification tasks, we show that the relative belief procedure typically chooses Hilbert spaces that are never smaller in dimension than those selected from optimizing a broad class of information criteria, including Akaike's criterion. As a concrete and focused exposition of this powerful evidence-based technique, we apply the relative belief procedure to an important application: state reconstruction of imperfect quantum sources. In particular, just by comparing prior and posterior probabilities based on data, we demonstrate its capability of tracking multiphoton emissions using (realistically lossy) single-photon detectors in order to assess the actual quality of photon sources without making ad hoc assumptions, thereby reliably safeguarding source integrity for general quantum-information and communication tasks with Bayesian reasoning. Finally, we discuss how relative belief can be exploited to carry out parametric model certification and estimate the total dimension of the quantum state for the combined (measured) physical and interacting external systems described by the Tavis--Cummings model.</description>

Abstract: Radiative corrections which remove accidental degeneracy in the spectrum of the relativistic hydrogen atom and lead to the modification of the Coulomb law, are calculated within the novel approach, based on the exact solution of the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential. The energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom is obtained with account of these corrections and the Lamb shift is calculated for the lowest energy states.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal synchronization of active quantum spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active agents are capable of exerting nonreciprocal forces upon one another. For instance, one agent may attract another one, which in turn is repelled. These antagonistic nonreciprocal interactions have been extensively studied in classical systems, revealing a wealth of exciting phenomena such as novel phase transitions and traveling-wave states. Whether these phenomena can originate in quantum many-body systems is an open issue, and proposals for their realization are lacking. In this work, we present a model of two species of quantum spins that interact in an antagonistic nonreciprocal way of the attraction-repulsion type. We propose an implementation based on two atomic ensembles coupled via chiral waveguides featuring both braided and non-braided geometries. The spins are active due to the presence of local gain, which allows them to synchronize. We show that nonreciprocal interactions deeply affect their synchronization dynamics. In the thermodynamic limit, this results in a nonreciprocal phase transition to nonstationary traveling-wave states, associated with spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. We establish how this symmetry emerges from the microscopic quantum model. For a finite number of spins, we discuss how traveling-wave states and nonreciprocal phase transitions are revealed by spin correlations measurable via the output field of the waveguides. Our work opens a new avenue to explore nonreciprocal interactions in active quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Determination of Optimal Chain Coupling made by Embedding in D-Wave Quantum Annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The qubits in a D-wave quantum annealer (D-wave QA) are designed on a Pegasus graph that is different from structure of a combinatorial optimization problem. This situation requires embedding with the chains connected by ferromagnetic (FM) coupling $J_c$ between the qubits. Weak and strong $J_c$ values induce chain breaking and enforcement of chain energy, which reduce the accuracy of quantum annealing (QA) measurements, respectively. In addition, we confirmed that even though the D-Wave Ocean package provides a default coupling $J_c^{\text{default}}$, it is not an optimal coupling $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ that maximizes the possible correct rate of QA measurements. In this paper, we present an algorithm how $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ with the maximum probability $p$ for observing the possible lowest energy is determined. Finally, we confirm that the extracted $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ show much better $p$ than $J_c^{\text{default}}$ in QA measurements of various parameters of frustrated and fully connected combinatorial optimization problems. The open code is available in \textit{https://github.com/HunpyoLee/OptimizeChainStrength}.</description>

      <title>Computational Supremacy of Quantum Eigensolver by Extension of Optimized Binary Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a quantum eigensolver (QE) which is based on an extension of optimized binary configurations measured by quantum annealing (QA) on a D-Wave Quantum Annealer (D-Wave QA). This approach performs iterative QA measurements to optimize the eigenstates $\vert \psi \rangle$ without the derivation of a classical computer. The computational cost is $\eta M L$ for full eigenvalues $E$ and $\vert \psi \rangle$ of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ of size $L \times L$, where $M$ and $\eta$ are the number of QA measurements required to reach the converged $\vert \psi \rangle$ and the total annealing time of many QA shots, respectively. Unlike the exact diagonalized (ED) algorithm with $L^3$ iterations on a classical computer, the computation cost is not significantly affected by $L$ and $M$ because $\eta$ represents a very short time within $10^{-2}$ seconds on the D-Wave QA. We selected the tight-binding $\hat{H}$ that contains the exact $E$ values of all energy states in two systems with metallic and insulating phases. We confirmed that the proposed QE algorithm provides exact solutions within the errors of $5 \times 10^{-3}$. The QE algorithm will not only show computational supremacy over the ED approach on a classical computer but will also be widely used for various applications such as material and drug design.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a (compact) quantum fully homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme starting from (compact) classical fully homomorphic encryption scheme with decryption in $\mathsf{NC}^{1}$, together with a dual-mode trapdoor function family. Compared to previous constructions (Mahadev, FOCS 2018; Brakerski, CRYPTO 2018) which made non-black-box use of similar underlying primitives, our construction provides a pathway to instantiations from different assumptions. Our construction uses the techniques of Dulek, Schaffner and Speelman (CRYPTO 2016) and shows how to make the client in their QFHE scheme classical using dual-mode trapdoor functions. As an additional contribution, we show a new instantiation of dual-mode trapdoor functions from group actions.</description>

      <title>Paths towards time evolution with larger neural-network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the neural-network quantum states method has been investigated to study the ground state and the time evolution of many-body quantum systems. Here we expand on the investigation and consider a quantum quench from the paramagnetic to the anti-ferromagnetic phase in the tilted Ising model. We use two types of neural networks, a restricted Boltzmann machine and a feed-forward neural network. We show that for both types of networks, the projected time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (p-tVMC) method performs better than the non-projected approach. We further demonstrate that one can use K-FAC or minSR in conjunction with p-tVMC to reduce the computational complexity of the stochastic reconfiguration approach, thus allowing the use of these techniques for neural networks with more parameters.</description>

      <title>Hot Schr\"odinger Cat States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of quantum phenomena often necessitates sufficiently pure states, a requirement that can be challenging to achieve. In this study, our goal is to prepare a non-classical state originating from a mixed state, utilizing dynamics that preserve the initial low purity of the state. We generate a quantum superposition of displaced thermal states within a microwave cavity using only unitary interactions with a transmon qubit. We measure the Wigner functions of these ``hot'' Schr\"odinger cat states for an initial purity as low as 0.06. This corresponds to a cavity mode temperature of up to 1.8 Kelvin, sixty times hotter than the cavity's physical environment. Our realization of highly mixed quantum superposition states could be implemented with other continuous-variable systems e.g. nanomechanical oscillators, for which ground-state cooling remains challenging.</description>

      <title>Parallel Quantum Computing Simulations via Quantum Accelerator Platform Virtualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit execution is the central task in quantum computation. Due to inherent quantum-mechanical constraints, quantum computing workflows often involve a considerable number of independent measurements over a large set of slightly different quantum circuits. Here we discuss a simple model for parallelizing simulation of such quantum circuit executions that is based on introducing a large array of virtual quantum processing units, mapped to classical HPC nodes, as a parallel quantum computing platform. Implemented within the XACC framework, the model can readily take advantage of its backend-agnostic features, enabling parallel quantum circuit execution over any target backend supported by XACC. We illustrate the performance of this approach by demonstrating strong scaling in two pertinent domain science problems, namely in computing the gradients for the multi-contracted variational quantum eigensolver and in data-driven quantum circuit learning, where we vary the number of qubits and the number of circuit layers. The latter (classical) simulation leverages the cuQuantum SDK library to run efficiently on GPU-accelerated HPC platforms.</description>

      <title>Raman effects in Quantum Frequency Conversion using Bragg Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum-mechanical model that describes fiber-based frequency conversion by four-wave-mixing Bragg scattering in the presence of Raman interactions. In the case of continuous-wave pumps we find closed-form expressions for the conversion efficiency and photon statistics, characterized by the second-order correlation function. For pulsed pumps, we derive a highly general model based on Green functions, and provide a numerical solution method using a split-step scheme. In both cases, we find that noise from spontaneous Raman scattering can pose a serious challenge to this type of frequency conversion if the pumps are less than 30 THz from the quantum fields. However, this impact can be mitigated with crosspolarized pumps and on the anti-Stokes side, through cooling of the fiber.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Theory of Strongly Correlated Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report reviews recent progress in computing Kubo formulas for general interacting Hamiltonians. The aim is to calculate electric and thermal magneto-conductivities in strong scattering regimes where Boltzmann equation and Hall conductivity proxies exceed their validity. Three primary approaches are explained.
  1. Degeneracy-projected polarization formulas for Hall-type conductivities, which substantially reduce the number of calculated current matrix elements. These expressions generalize the Berry curvature integral formulas to imperfect lattices. 2. Continued fraction representation of dynamical longitudinal conductivities. The calculations produce a set of thermodynamic averages, which can be controllably extrapolated using their mathematical relations to low and high frequency conductivity asymptotics. 3. Hall-type coefficients summation formulas, which are constructed from thermodynamic averages.
  The thermodynamic formulas are derived in the operator Hilbert space formalism, which avoids the opacity and high computational cost of the Hamiltonian eigenspectrum. The coefficients can be obtained by well established imaginary-time Monte Carlo sampling, high temperature expansion, traces of operator products, and variational wavefunctions at low temperatures. We demonstrate the power of approaches 1--3 by their application to well known models of lattice electrons and bosons. The calculations clarify the far-reaching influence of strong local interactions on the metallic transport near Mott insulators. Future directions for these approaches are discussed.</description>

      <title>KPZ scaling from the Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a superdiffusion exhibiting the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling in late-time correlators and autocorrelators of certain interacting many-body systems has been reported. Inspired by these results, we explore the KPZ scaling in correlation functions using their realization in the Krylov operator basis. We focus on the Heisenberg time scale, which approximately corresponds to the ramp--plateau transition for the Krylov complexity in systems with a large but finite number degrees of freedom. Two frameworks are under consideration: i) the system with growing Lanczos coefficients and an artificial cut-off, and ii) the system with the finite Hilbert space. In both cases via numerical analysis, we observe the transition from Gaussian to KPZ-like scaling at the critical Euclidean time $t_{E}^*=c_{cr}K$, for the Krylov chain of finite length $K$, and $c_{cr}=O(1)$. In particular, we find a scaling $\sim K^{1/3}$ for fluctuations in the one-point correlation function and a dynamical scaling $\sim K^{-2/3}$ associated with the return probability (Loschmidt echo) corresponding to autocorrelators in physical space. In the first case, the transition is of the 3rd order and can be considered as an example of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), while in the second, it is a crossover. For case ii), utilizing the relationship between the spectrum of tridiagonal matrices at the spectral edge and the spectrum of the stochastic Airy operator, we demonstrate analytically the origin of the KPZ scaling for the particular Krylov chain using the results of the probability theory. We argue that there is some outcome of our study for the double scaling limit of matrix models. For the case of topological gravity, the white noise $O(\frac{1}{N})$ term is identified, which should be taken into account in the controversial issue of ensemble averaging in 2D/1D holography.</description>

      <title>Shaping the topology of twisted bilayer graphene via time-reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking is an effective tool for tuning the transport and topological properties of 2D layered materials. Among these materials, twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has emerged as a promising platform for new physics, characterized by a rich interplay between topological features and strongly correlated electronic behavior. In this study, we utilize time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) to manipulate the topological properties of TBG. By varying the strength of TRSB, we discover a topological phase transition between a topological insulating phase, which exhibits a pair of flat bands with opposite Chern numbers, and a novel insulating state where the Chern number, but not the Berry curvature, of the flat bands vanishes. We demonstrate that this topological transition is mediated by a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, and we construct a three-dimensional phase diagram as a function of the twisting angle, the symmetry-breaking parameter, and the mismatch coupling between AA and AB stacking regions. Finally, we show that this novel electronic phase can be identified in the lab by measuring, as a function of the Fermi energy, its non-quantized anomalous Hall conductivity that is induced by the Berry dipole density of the lowest flat bands.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency microwave photodetection by cavity coupled double dots with single cavity-photon sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a superconducting cavity-coupled double quantum dot (DQD) photodiode that achieves a maximum photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 25% in the microwave domain. With a higher-quality-factor cavity and improved device design to prevent photon leakages through unwanted pathways, our device measures microwave signals down to 100 aW power level and achieves sensitivity to probe microwave signals with one photon at a time in the cavity. We analyze the photodiode operation using Jaynes-Cummings input-output theory, identifying the key improvements of stronger cavity-DQD coupling needed to achieve near-unity photodetection efficiency. The results presented in this work represent a crucial advancement toward near unity microwave photodetection efficiency with single cavity-photon sensitivity for studies of photon statistics in the microwave range and applications related to quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective Lagrangian of itinerant electron system of finite density at finite magnetic field is found to include Chern-Simons term of electromagnetic potentials of lower scale dimension than those studied before. This term has an origin in many-body wave function and unique topological property that is independent of a spin degree of freedom. The coupling strength is proportional to $\frac{\rho}{eB}$, which is singular at $B=0$ for a constant charge density. The effective Lagrangian at a finite $B$ represents physical effects at $ B \neq 0$ properly. A universal shift of the magnetic field known as Slater-Pauling curve is derived from the effective Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>A dynamical implementation of canonical second quantization on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop theoretical methods for the implementation of creation and destruction operators in separate registers of a quantum computer, allowing for a transparent and dynamical creation and destruction of particle modes in second quantization in problems with variable particle number. We establish theorems for the commutation (anticommutation) relations on a finite memory bank and provide the needed symmetrizing and antisymmetrizing operators. Finally, we provide formulae in terms of these operators for unitary evolution under conventional two- and four-body Hamiltonian terms, as well as terms varying the particle number. In this formalism, the number of qubits needed to codify $n$ particles with $N_p$ modes each is of order $n\log_2 N_p$. Such scaling is more efficient than the Jordan-Wigner transformation which requires $O(N_p)$ qubits, whenever there are a modest number of particles with a large number of states available to each (and less advantageous for a large number of particles with few states available to each). And although less efficient, it is also less cumbersome than compact encoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical control and read-out of the ground state spin structure has been demonstrated for defect states in crystalline semiconductors, including the diamond NV- center, and these are promising systems for quantum technologies. Molecular organic semiconductors offer synthetic control of spin placement, in contrast to current limitations in these crystalline systems. Here we report the discovery of spin-optical addressability in a diradical molecule that comprises two trityl radical groups coupled via a fluorene bridge. We demonstrate the three important properties that enable operation as a spin-photon interface: (i) triplet and singlet spin states show photoluminescence peaked at 640 and 700 nm respectively; this allows easy optical measurement of ground state spin. (ii) the ground state spin exchange is small (~60 {\mu}eV) that allows preparation of ground state spin population. This can be achieved by spin-selective excited state intersystem crossing, and we report up to 8% microwave-driven contrast in photoluminescence. (iii) both singlet and triplet manifolds have near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, which is in contrast to the near-zero quantum yields in prior reports of molecular diradicals. Our results establish these tuneable open-shell organic molecules as a platform to engineer tailor-made spin-optical interfaces.</description>

Abstract: A discrete formulation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a functional of paths with respect to a complex probability on a sample space of discrete valued paths is explored. The formulation in terms of complex probabilities is motivated by a recent reinterpretation of the real-time path integral as the expectation value of a potential functional with respect to a complex probability distribution on cylinder sets of paths. The discrete formulation in this work is based on a discrete version of Weyl algebra that can be applied to any observable with a finite number of outcomes. The origin of the complex probability in this work is the completeness relation. In the discrete formulation the complex probability exactly factors into products of conditional probabilities and exact unitarity is maintained at each level of approximation. The approximation of infinite dimensional quantum systems by discrete systems is discussed. Applications to scattering theory and quantum field theory are illustrated.</description>

Abstract: Qubit noise spectroscopy is an important tool for the experimental investigation of open quantum systems. However, conventional techniques for implementing noise spectroscopy are time-consuming, because they require multiple measurements of the noise spectral density at different frequencies. Here we describe an alternative method for quickly characterizing the spectral density. Our method uses mathematical techniques for phase retrieval, in order to generate random pulse sequences with carefully-controlled correlations among the pulses, which can measure arbitrary linear functionals of the noise spectrum. Such measurements allow us to estimate $k$'th-order moments of the noise spectrum, as well as to reconstruct sparse noise spectra via compressed sensing. Our simulations of the performance of the random pulse sequences on a realistic physical system, self-assembled quantum dots, reveal a speedup of an order of magnitude in extracting the noise spectrum, compared to conventional dynamical decoupling approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental interactions are ubiquitous in any real-world application of a quantum information processing protocol. Such interactions result in depletion of quantum resources. Two important figure of merits in the context of quantum information are the fully entangled fraction (FEF) and conditional entropy of a composite quantum system. FEF has a key role to play in tasks like teleportation. Conditional entropy on the other hand can be negative for certain quantum states and thus the negativity remains a resource for tasks like dense coding and state merging. FEF $ &gt; 1/d $ for a $ d \otimes d $ quantum system is a significant threshold, however for some quantum states it remains less than the threshold even with global unitary operations, consequently being known as states having absolute fully entangled fraction (AFEF). Pertaining to conditional von Neumann entropy, there are some states which retains the nonnegativity of the conditional entropy under global unitary action, to be called as states with absolute conditional von Neumann entropy nonnegative (ACVENN) property. In the present submission, we probe the action of some quantum channels in two qubits and two qudits and find that some quantum states move from the non-absolute regime to the absolute regime under the action. Since, global unitary operations are unable to retrieve them back to the non-absolute regime, we provide a prescription for the retrieval using an entanglement swapping network. Furthermore, we extend the notion of absoluteness to conditional R\'enyi entropies and find the required condition for a state to have absolute conditional R\'enyi entropy non-negative (ACRENN) property. We then extend the work to include the marginals of a tripartite system and provide for their characterization with respect to the aforementioned absolute properties.</description>

      <title>Optimal mixers restricted to subspaces and the stabilizer formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel formalism to both understand and construct mixers that preserve a given subspace. The method connects and utilizes the stabilizer formalism that is used in error correcting codes. This can be useful in the setting when the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), a popular meta-heuristic for solving combinatorial optimization problems, is applied in the setting where the constraints of the problem lead to a feasible subspace that is large but easy to specify. The proposed method gives a systematic way to construct mixers that are resource efficient in the number of controlled not gates and can be understood as a generalization of the well-known X and XY mixers and a relaxation of the Grover mixer: Given a basis of any subspace, a resource efficient mixer can be constructed that preserves the subspace. The numerical examples provided show a dramatic reduction of CX gates when compared to previous results. We call our approach logical X-Mixer or logical X QAOA ($\textbf{LX-QAOA}$), since it can be understood as dividing the subspace into code spaces of stabilizers S and consecutively applying logical rotational X gates associated with these code spaces. Overall, we hope that this new perspective can lead to further insight into the development of quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We study Haar-random bases and pretty good measurement for Bayesian state estimation. Given $N$ Haar-random bases we derive a bound on fidelity averaged over IID sequences of such random measurements for a uniform ensemble of pure states. For ensembles of mixed qubit states, we find that measurements defined through unitary 2-designs closely approximate those defined via Haar random unitaries while the Pauli group only gives a weak lower bound. For a single-shot-update, we show using the Petz recovery map for pretty good measurement that it can give pretty good Bayesian mean estimates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Unoptimization</title>

Abstract: Optimization of circuits is an essential task for both quantum and classical computers to improve their efficiency. In contrast, classical logic optimization is known to be difficult, and a lot of heuristic approaches have been developed so far. In this study, we define and construct a quantum algorithmic primitive called quantum circuit unoptimization, which makes a given quantum circuit complex by introducing some redundancies while preserving circuit equivalence, i.e., the inverse operation of circuit optimization. Using quantum circuit unoptimization, we propose the quantum circuit equivalence test, a decision problem contained both in the NP and BQP classes but is not trivially included in the P class. Furthermore, as a practical application, we construct concrete unoptimization recipes to generate compiler benchmarks and evaluate circuit optimization performance using Qiskit and Pytket. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that quantum circuit unoptimizer systematically generates redundant circuits that are challenging for compilers to optimize, which can be used to compare the performance of different compilers and improve them. We also offer potential applications of quantum circuit unoptimization, such as generating quantum advantageous machine learning datasets and quantum computer fidelity benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production from Maximum Entropy Principle: a Unifying Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy production is the crucial quantity characterizing irreversible phenomena and the second law of thermodynamics. Yet, a ubiquitous definition eludes consensus. Given that entropy production arises from incomplete access to information, in this Letter we use Jaynes' maximum entropy principle to establish a framework that brings together prominent and apparently conflicting definitions. More generally our definition of entropy production addresses any tomographically incomplete quantum measurement and/or the action of a quantum channel on a system.</description>

Abstract: Perfect inline squeezers are both spectrally pure and have identical input and output temporal modes, allowing one to squeeze an arbitrary input quantum state in the sole input mode on which the device acts, while the quantum states of any other modes are unaffected. We study theoretically how to obtain a perfect pulsed inline squeezer in twin-beam systems by considering three commonly used configurations: unpoled single pass, poled single pass, and poled double pass. By obtaining analytical relations between the input and output temporal modes from the Bloch-Messiah decomposition of the discretized Heisenberg-picture propagator, we find that a double pass structure produces a perfect pulsed inline squeezer when operated in a frequency degenerate, symmetric group-velocity matched type-II configuration.</description>

Abstract: Considering a general microscopic model for quantum measurement comprising a measurement apparatus coupled to a thermal bath, we analyze the energetic resources necessary for the realisation of quantum measurements, including the process of switching on and off the coupling between the system and the apparatus, the transition to a statistical mixture, the classical readout, and the apparatus resetting. We show via general thermodynamic arguments that the minimal required work depends on the energy variation of the system being measured plus information-theoretic quantities characterizing the performance of the measurement -- efficiency and completeness. Additionally, providing an explicit protocol, we show that it is possible to perform thermodynamically reversible measurement, thus reaching the minimal work expenditure. Finally, for finite-time measurement protocols, we illustrate the increasing work cost induced by rising entropy production inherent of finite-time thermodynamic processes. This highlights an emerging trade-off between velocity of the measurement and work cost, on top of a trade-off between efficiency of the measurement and work cost.</description>

      <title>Flying-cat parity checks for quantum error correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long range, multi-qubit parity checks have applications in both quantum error correction and measurement-based entanglement generation. Such parity checks could be performed using qubit-state-dependent phase shifts on propagating pulses of light described by coherent states $\vert\alpha\rangle$ of the electromagnetic field. We consider "flying-cat" parity checks based on an entangling operation that is quantum non-demolition (QND) for Schr\"odinger's cat states $\vert\alpha\rangle\pm \vert-\alpha\rangle$. This operation encodes parity information in the phase of maximally distinguishable coherent states $\vert\pm \alpha\rangle$, which can be read out using a phase-sensitive measurement of the electromagnetic field. In contrast to many implementations, where single-qubit errors and measurement errors can be treated as independent, photon loss during flying-cat parity checks introduces errors on physical qubits at a rate that is anti-correlated with the probability for measurement errors. We analyze this trade-off for three-qubit parity checks, which are a requirement for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing with the subsystem surface code. We further show how a six-qubit entangled "tetrahedron" state can be prepared using these three-qubit parity checks. The tetrahedron state can be used as a resource for controlled quantum teleportation of a two-qubit state, or as a source of shared randomness with potential applications in three-party quantum key distribution. Finally, we provide conditions for performing high-quality flying-cat parity checks in a state-of-the-art circuit QED architecture, accounting for qubit decoherence, internal cavity losses, and finite-duration pulses, in addition to transmission losses.</description>

      <title>Measuring two temperatures using a single thermometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question: Is it possible to measure two temperatures simultaneously using a single thermometer? Under common circumstances, where the thermometer can interact with only one bath at a time and the interaction leads to complete thermalization, this is clearly impossible because the final state of the thermometer would be independent of the temperature of the first bath. In this work, we show that this task can indeed be accomplished with the assistance of quantum control. In particular, we consider a composite particle with multiple quantum degrees of freedom (DoF) as a temperature sensor, where one of the DoF -- termed as internal DoF -- is susceptible to the local temperature, thereby functioning as a thermometer, whereas another DoF -- termed external DoF -- is quantum-controlled. We leverage the entanglement between the aforementioned DoF in a composite particle for two-temperature thermometry by preparing the external DoF in a quantum superposition, exposing the internal DoF to two local temperatures. We show that such a particle used in a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer, or a quantum switch -- which allows quantum control over the order of application of quantum channels -- can be used to estimate two temperatures simultaneously, thus affirming our main proposition. For each of these setups, we obtain the variance in the estimated temperatures through the multi-parameter Cram\'er-Rao bound, and compare their performances based on the range of total variance of the two temperatures estimated. On benchmarking all the setups based on the total variance of the estimated temperatures, we find that a quantum switch with a qudit probe outperforms other setups. On restricting our probe to be a qubit, we find that quantum switch performs equally well as a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Purification of Quantum Trajectories under Random Generalized Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general framework to study quantum trajectories resulting from repeated random measurements subject to stationary noise, and generalize results of K\"ummerer and Maassen to this setting. The resulting trajectory of quantum states is a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain in a random environment. K\"ummerer and Maassen introduced the concept of dark subspaces for noise-free processes, establishing that their absence is equivalent to asymptotic purification of the system state. We clarify the notion of dark subspaces in the disordered setting by defining a measurable correspondence consisting of a collection of random subspaces satisfying a darkness condition. We further prove that asymptotic purification occurs if and only if this collection of random dark subspaces is empty. Several examples of these phenomena are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum paradoxes are essential means to reveal the incompatibility between quantum and classical theories, among which the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering paradox offers a sharper criterion for the contradiction between local-hidden-state model and quantum mechanics than the usual inequality-based method. In this work, we present a generalized EPR steering paradox, which predicts a contradictory equality $2_{Q}=\left( 1+\delta\right)_{C}$ ($0\leq\delta&lt;1$) given by the quantum ($Q$) and classical ($C$) theories. For any $N$-qubit state in which the conditional state of the steered party is pure, we test the paradox through a two-setting steering protocol, and find that the state is steerable if some specific measurement requirements are satisfied. Moreover, our construction also enlightens the building of EPR steering inequality, which may contribute to some schemes for typical quantum teleportation and quantum key distributions.</description>

      <title>Defining subsystems in Hilbert spaces with non-Euclidean metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work outlines a consistent method of identifying subsystems in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, independent of the underlying inner-product structure. It has been well established that Hilbert spaces with modified inner-product, defined through the so-called metric operator, turn out to be the most natural ways to represent certain phenomena such as those involving balanced gain and loss resulting in pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. For composite systems undergoing pseudo-Hermitian evolution, defining the subsystems is generally considered feasible only when the metric operator is chosen to have a tensor product form so that a partial trace operation can be well defined. In this work, we use arguments from algebraic quantum mechanics to show that the subsystems can be well-defined in every metric space -- irrespective of whether or not the metric is of tensor product form. This is done by identifying subsystems with a decomposition of the underlying $C^*$-algebra into commuting sub-algebras. We show that different subsystem decompositions correspond to choosing different equivalence classes of the GNS representation. Furthermore, given a form of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian, the choice of the Hamiltonian compatible metric characterizes the subsystem decomposition and as a consequence, the entanglement structure in the system. We clarify how each of the subsystems, defined this way, can be tomographically constructed and that these subsystems satisfy the no-signaling principle. With these results, we put all the choices of the metric operator on an equal footing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems unfolds within a subspace of the state space or operator space, known as the Krylov space. This review presents the use of Krylov subspace methods to provide a compact and computationally efficient description of quantum evolution, with emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena of many-body systems with a large Hilbert space. It provides a comprehensive update of recent developments, focused on the quantum evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture as well as pure and mixed states. It further explores the notion of Krylov complexity and associated metrics as tools for quantifying operator growth, their bounds by generalized quantum speed limits, the universal operator growth hypothesis, and its relation to quantum chaos, scrambling, and generalized coherent states. A comparison of several generalizations of the Krylov construction for open quantum systems is presented. A closing discussion addresses the application of Krylov subspace methods in quantum field theory, holography, integrability, quantum control, and quantum computing, as well as current open problems.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in the Anisotropic Dicke-Stark Model with $A$-square terms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superradiant phase transition (SRPT) is forbidden in the standard isotropic Dicke model due to the so-called no-go theorem induced by A-square term. In the framework of the Dicke model, we demonstrate that SRPTs can occur at both zero and finite temperatures if we intrinsically tune the rotating wave and count-rotating atom-cavity coupling independently, and/or introduce the nonlinear Stark coupling terms, thus overcoming the no-go theorem. The phase transitions in this so-called anisotropic Dicke-Stark model share the same universality class with the original Dicke model. The critical coupling strength of this model decreases with the isotropic constant gradually, but can be driven to zero quickly with the strong nonlinear Stark coupling. We believe that we have proposed a feasible scheme to observe the SRPT in the future solid-state experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.06067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The square root of Not is a logical operator of importance in quantum computing theory and of interest as a mathematical object in its own right. In physics, it is a square complex matrix of dimension 2. In the present work it is a complex square matrix of arbitrary dimension. The introduction of linear algebra into logical theory has been enhanced in recent decades by the researches in the field of neural networks and quantum computing. Here we will make a brief description of the representation of logical operations through matrices and we show how general expressions for the two square roots of the Not operator are obtained. Then, we explore two topics. First, we study an extension to a non-quantum domain of a short form of Deutsch's algorithm. Then, we assume that a root of Not is a matrix extension of the imaginary unit i, and under this idea we obtain fully matrix versions for the Euler expansions and for the representations of circular functions by complex exponentials.</description>

      <title>Path-integral approaches to strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core of this thesis is the path-integral formulation of quantum field theory and its ability to describe strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems of finite size. Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with various resummation methods (Pad\'e-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion (LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...), functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic bosonic $t$-$J$ models and their quantum simulation in tweezer arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of optical tweezer arrays with strong interactions -- via dipole-exchange of molecules and van-der-Waals interactions of Rydberg atoms -- has opened the door for the exploration of a wide variety of quantum spin models. A next significant step will be the combination of such settings with mobile dopants: This will enable to simulate the physics believed to underlie many strongly correlated quantum materials. Here we propose an experimental scheme to realize bosonic t-J models via encoding the local Hilbert space in a set of three internal atomic or molecular states. By engineering antiferromagnetic (AFM) couplings between spins, competition between charge motion and magnetic order similar to that in high-$T_c$ cuprates can be realized. Since the ground states of the 2D bosonic AFM t-J model we propose to realize have not been studied extensively before, we start by analyzing the case of two dopants -- the simplest instance in which their bosonic statistics plays a role, and contrast our results to the fermionic case. We perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations on six-legged cylinders, and find a strong tendency for bosonic holes to form stripes. This demonstrates that bosonic, AFM t-J models may contain similar physics as the collective phases in strongly correlated electrons.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning-based approach for numerical simulation of a time-evolving Schr\"odinger equation inspired by stochastic mechanics and generative diffusion models. Unlike existing approaches, which exhibit computational complexity that scales exponentially in the problem dimension, our method allows us to adapt to the latent low-dimensional structure of the wave function by sampling from the Markovian diffusion. Depending on the latent dimension, our method may have far lower computational complexity in higher dimensions. Moreover, we propose novel equations for stochastic quantum mechanics, resulting in quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of dimensions. Numerical simulations verify our theoretical findings and show a significant advantage of our method compared to other deep-learning-based approaches used for quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detailed fluctuation theorem implies symmetry in the generating function of entropy production probability. The integral fluctuation theorem directly follows from this symmetry and the normalization of the probability. In this paper, we rewrite the generating function by integrating measurements and evolution into a constructed mapping. This mapping is completely positive, and the original integral FT is determined by the trace-preserving property of these constructed maps. We illustrate the convenience of this method by discussing the eigenstate fluctuation theorem and heat exchange between two baths. This set of methods is also applicable to the generating functions of quasi-probability, where we observe the Petz recovery map arising naturally from this approach.</description>

      <title>Dissipative preparation of a Floquet topological insulator in an optical lattice via bath engineering</title>

Abstract: Floquet engineering is an important tool for realizing topologically nontrivial band structures for charge-neutral atoms in optical lattices. However, the preparation of a topological-band-insulator-type state of fermions, with one nontrivial quasi-energy band filled completely and the others empty, is challenging as a result of both driving induced heating as well as imperfect adiabatic state preparation (with the latter induced by the unavoidable gap closing when passing the topological transition). An alternative procedure that has been proposed is to prepare such states dissipatively, i.e. as a steady state that emerges when coupling the system to reservoirs. Here we discuss a concrete scheme that couples the system to a weakly interacting Bose condensate given by second atomic species acting as a heat bath. Our strategy relies on the engineering of the potential for the bath particles, so that they occupy weakly coupled tubes perpendicular to the two-dimensional system. Using Floquet-Born-Markov theory, we show that the resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the driven-dissipative system approximates a topological insulator. We even find indications for the approximate stabilization of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator, a state that is impossible to realize in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Beyond trace class -- Tensor products of Hilbert spaces and operator ideals in quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the meaning of the conjugate of a complex Hilbert space, including a related application of the theorem of Fr\'{e}chet-Riesz (by which an analysis of semilinear operators can be reduced to - linear - operator theory) to a revisit of applications of nuclear and absolutely $p$-summing operators in algebraic quantum field theory in the sense of Araki, Haag and Kastler ($p=2$) and more recently in the framework of general probabilistic spaces ($p=1$), we will outline that Banach operator ideals in the sense of Pietsch, or equivalently tensor products of Banach spaces in the sense of Grothendieck are even lurking in the foundations and philosophy of quantum physics and quantum information theory. In particular, we concentrate on their importance in algebraic quantum field theory. In doing so, we establish a canonical isometric isomorphism between the Hilbert spaces $H\otimes_2 (K \otimes_2 L)$ and $(H \otimes_2 K) \otimes_2 L$ (Theorem 3.8) and revisit the role of trace class operators.
  A few applications are specified, including the appropriateness of the class of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an implied Banach operator ideal representation of the tensor product of two complex Hilbert spaces $H \otimes_2 K$ (Proposition 3.4) and a purely linear algebraic description of the quantum teleportation process (Example 3.10).</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum computation with Cooper pair splitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a practical implementation of a universal quantum computer that uses local fermionic modes (LFM) rather than qubits. The device layout consists of quantum dots tunnel coupled by a hybrid superconducting island and a tunable capacitive coupling between the dots. We show that coherent control of Cooper pair splitting, elastic cotunneling, and Coulomb interactions allows us to implement the universal set of quantum gates defined by Bravyi and Kitaev. Due to the similarity with charge qubits, we expect charge noise to be the main source of decoherence. For this reason, we also consider an alternative design where the quantum dots have tunable coupling to the superconductor. In this second device design, we show that there is a sweetspot for which the local fermionic modes are charge neutral, making the device insensitive to charge noise effects. Finally, we compare both designs and their experimental limitations and suggest future efforts to overcome them.</description>

      <title>Gapless symmetry-protected topological phases and generalized deconfined critical points from gauging a finite subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauging a finite subgroup of a global symmetry can map conventional phases and phase transitions to unconventional ones. In this work, we study, as a concrete example, an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged system with global symmetry $U(1)$, namely, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged Bose-Hubbard model both in 1-D and in 2-D. In certain limits, there is an emergent mixed 't Hooft anomaly between the quotient $\tilde{U}(1)$ symmetry and the dual $\hat{\mathbb{Z}}_2$ symmetry. In 1-D, the superfluid phase is mapped to an intrinsically gapless symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, as supported by density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. In 2-D, the original superfluid-insulator transition becomes a generalized deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a gapless SPT phase, where a SPT order coexists with Goldstone modes, and a $\tilde{U}(1)$-symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phase. We also discuss the stability of these phases and the critical points to small perturbations and their potential experimental realizations. Our work demonstrates that partial gauging is a simple and yet powerful approach in constructing novel phases and quantum criticalities.</description>

Abstract: The recent development of quantum computing, which uses entanglement, superposition, and other quantum fundamental concepts, can provide substantial processing advantages over traditional computing. These quantum features help solve many complex problems that cannot be solved with conventional computing methods. These problems include modeling quantum mechanics, logistics, chemical-based advances, drug design, statistical science, sustainable energy, banking, reliable communication, and quantum chemical engineering. The last few years have witnessed remarkable advancements in quantum software and algorithm creation and quantum hardware research, which has significantly advanced the prospect of realizing quantum computers. It would be helpful to have comprehensive literature research on this area to grasp the current status and find outstanding problems that require considerable attention from the research community working in the quantum computing industry. To better understand quantum computing, this paper examines the foundations and vision based on current research in this area. We discuss cutting-edge developments in quantum computer hardware advancement and subsequent advances in quantum cryptography, quantum software, and high-scalability quantum computers. Many potential challenges and exciting new trends for quantum technology research and development are highlighted in this paper for a broader debate.</description>

      <title>Observation of Nonlinear Response and Onsager Regression in a Photon Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum regression theorem states that the correlations of a system at two different times are governed by the same equations of motion as the temporal response of the average values. Such a relation provides a powerful framework for the investigation of physical systems by establishing a formal connection between intrinsic microscopic behaviour and a macroscopic 'effect' due to an external 'cause'. Measuring the response to a controlled perturbation in this way allows to determine, for example, structure factors in condensed matter systems as well as other correlation functions of material systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the two-time particle number correlations in a photon Bose-Einstein condensate inside a dye-filled microcavity exhibit the same dynamics as the response of the condensate to a sudden perturbation of the dye molecule bath. This confirms the regression theorem for a quantum gas and, moreover, establishes a test of this relation in an unconventional form where the perturbation acts on the bath and only the condensate response is monitored. For strong perturbations, we observe nonlinear relaxation dynamics which our microscopic theory relates to the equilibrium fluctuations, thereby extending the regression theorem beyond the regime of linear response. The demonstrated nonlinearity of the condensate-bath system paves the way for studies of novel elementary excitations in lattices of driven-dissipative photon condensates.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical properties of the one- and two-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model from large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with quenched disorder at $T = 0$ in one and two dimensions by means of stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations using a rigorous zero-temperature scheme. Using a sample-replication method and averaged Binder ratios, we determine the critical shift and width exponents $\nu_\mathrm{s}$ and $\nu_\mathrm{w}$ as well as unbiased critical points by finite-size scaling. Further, scaling of the disorder-averaged magnetisation at the critical point is used to determine the order-parameter critical exponent $\beta$ and the critical exponent $\nu_{\mathrm{av}}$ of the average correlation length. The dynamic scaling in the Griffiths phase is investigated by measuring the local susceptibility in the disordered phase and the dynamic exponent $z'$ is extracted. By applying various finite-size scaling protocols, we provide an extensive and comprehensive comparison between the different approaches on equal footing. The emphasis on effective zero-temperature simulations resolves several inconsistencies in existing literature.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem in energy-dependent potentials using semiclassical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave equations with energy-dependent potentials appear in many areas of physics, ranging from nuclear physics to black hole perturbation theory. In this work, we use the semi-classical WKB method to first revisit the computation of bound states of potential wells and reflection/transmission coefficients in terms of the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule and the Gamow formula. We then discuss the inverse problem, in which the latter observables are used as a starting point to reconstruct the properties of the potentials. By extending known inversion techniques to energy-dependent potentials, we demonstrate that so-called width-equivalent or WKB-equivalent potentials are not isospectral anymore. Instead, we explicitly demonstrate that constructing quasi-isospectral potentials with the inverse techniques is still possible. Those reconstructed, energy-independent potentials share key properties with the width-equivalent potentials. We report that including energy-dependent terms allows for a rich phenomenology, particularly for the energy-independent equivalent potentials.</description>

      <title>On the non-uniqueness of the energy-momentum and spin currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that, one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or in other words Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity can be removed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>
