      <title>Adaptive Attention Residual U-Net for curvilinear structure segmentation in fluorescence microscopy and biomedical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a challenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament networks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants, namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements, particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures, were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset. Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>DT4PCP: A Digital Twin Framework for Personalized Care Planning Applied to Type 2 Diabetes Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technology has emerged as a transformative approach in healthcare, but its application in personalized patient care remains limited. This paper aims to present a practical implementation of DT in the management of chronic diseases. We introduce a general DT framework for personalized care planning (DT4PCP), with the core components being a real-time virtual representation of a patient's health and emerging predictive models to enable adaptive, personalized care. We implemented the DT4PCP framework for managing Type 2 Diabetes (DT4PCP-T2D), enabling real-time collection of behavioral data from patients with T2D, predicting emergency department (ED) risks, simulating the effects of different interventions, and personalizing care strategies to reduce ED visits. The DT4PCP-T2D also integrates social determinants of health (SDoH) and other contextual data, offering a comprehensive view of the patient's health to ensure that care recommendations are tailored to individual needs. Through retrospective simulations, we demonstrate that integrating DTs in T2D management can lead to significant advancements in personalized medicine. This study underscores the potential of DT technology to revolutionize chronic disease care.</description>

      <title>Multiscale phase oscillations induced by cluster synchronisation in human connectome core network</title>

Abstract: Brain imaging data mapping onto human connectome networks enables the investigation of global brain dynamics, where the brain hubs play an essential role in transferring activity between different brain parts. At this scale, the synchronisation processes are increasingly investigated as one of the key mechanisms revealing many aspects of brain functional coherence in healthy brains and revealing deviations due to various brain disorders. For the human connectome core network, consisting of the eight brain hubs and the higher-order structure attached to them, previous simulations of Kuramoto phase oscillators at network nodes indicate instability of the global order parameter for a range of positive coupling strengths. In this work, we investigate the multiscale oscillations of the global phase order parameter and show that they are connected with the cluster synchronisation processes occurring in this range of couplings below the master stability threshold. We use the spectral graph analysis and eigenvector localisation methodology, where the clusters of nodes playing a similar role in the synchronisation processes have a small mutual distance in the eigenvector space. We determine three significant clusters of brain regions and show the position of hubs in them. With the parallel analysis of the weighted core network and its binary version, we demonstrate the primary role of the network's topology in the formation of synchronised clusters. Meanwhile, the wights of edges contribute to the hub's synchronisation with the surrounding cluster, stabilise the order parameter variations and reduce the multifractal spectrum.</description>

      <title>Synthetic MC via Biological Transmitters: Therapeutic Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However, generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices, poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal, safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA modulation.</description>

      <title>Predicting and generating antibiotics against future pathogens with ApexOracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities, ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature" molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future infectious-disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>KinDEL: DNA-Encoded Library Dataset for Kinase Inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA-Encoded Libraries (DELs) represent a transformative technology in drug discovery, facilitating the high-throughput exploration of vast chemical spaces. Despite their potential, the scarcity of publicly available DEL datasets presents a bottleneck for the advancement of machine learning methodologies in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce KinDEL, one of the largest publicly accessible DEL datasets and the first one that includes binding poses from molecular docking experiments. Focused on two kinases, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14 (MAPK14) and Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 1 (DDR1), KinDEL includes 81 million compounds, offering a rich resource for computational exploration. Additionally, we provide comprehensive biophysical assay validation data, encompassing both on-DNA and off-DNA measurements, which we use to evaluate a suite of machine learning techniques, including novel structure-based probabilistic models. We hope that our benchmark, encompassing both 2D and 3D structures, will help advance the development of machine learning models for data-driven hit identification using DELs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Cox Models: Assessing the Performance of Machine-Learning Methods in Non-Proportional Hazards and Non-Linear Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis often relies on Cox models, assuming both linearity and proportional hazards (PH). This study evaluates machine and deep learning methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets. In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size, non-linearity and non-PH conditions.

      <title>Fuzzy permutation time irreversibility for nonequilibrium analysis of complex system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation time irreversibility is an important method to quantify nonequilibrium characteristics of complex systems; however, ordinal pattern is a coarse-graining alternative of temporal structure and cannot accurately represent detailed structural information. This study aims to propose a fuzzy permutation time irreversibility (fpTIR) by measuring the difference between vector elements based on a negative exponential function. The amplitude permutation of vector is constructed and its membership degree is calculated; then, the difference in probability distribution between the forward and backward sequences is measured for fpTIR. To compare and measure the system's complexity, the Shannon entropy is calculated as the average amount of information in the fuzzy permutation probability distribution, i.e., fuzzy permutation entropy (fPEn). According to the surrogate theory, mode series are generated using logistic, Henon, and first-order autoregressive systems to verify the fpTIR, which is then used to analyze the heartbeats of patients with congestive heart failure and healthy elderly and young participants from the PhysioNet database. Results suggest that the fpTIR effectively measures the system's nonequilibrium characteristics, thus improving the accuracy of heartbeat analysis. However, in analyzing probability distributions, the fpTIR and fPEn exhibit discrepancies in the chaotic series and even opposite results in the heartbeats, wherein the results of fpTIR are consistent with the theory of complexity loss in aging and disease. Overall, the fpTIR accurately characterizes the structure of the sequences and enhances the accuracy of the nonequilibrium analysis of complex systems, providing a theoretical basis for exploring complex systems from the perspectives of nonequilibrium dynamics and entropy complexity.</description>
