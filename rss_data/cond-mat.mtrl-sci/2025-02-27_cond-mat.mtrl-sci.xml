      <title>Altermagnetic nanotextures revealed in bulk MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With many candidate altermagnetic materials, MnTe has emerged as one of the most promising systems, with growing experimental evidence for altermagnetic phenomena. So far, the majority of measurements have been performed on thin-films, or have involved surface measurements. However, the question of altermagnetic order in the bulk system - in the absence of substrate or surface effects - remains. Here we show evidence for bulk altermagnetism in single crystal MnTe, through spectroscopic X-ray microscopy. By performing nanoscale X-ray magnetic circular dichroic (XMCD) imaging in transmission on a 200 nm thick lamella, we observe domains and magnetic textures with a spectroscopic signature characteristic of altermagnetic order, thereby confirming the intrinsic nature of altermagnetism in MnTe. Quantitative analysis of the XMCD signal reveals an excellent agreement with predicted signals, establishing that the altermagnetic order exists throughout the thickness of the lamella and confirming the intrinsic, bulk nature of the state. With these results, we demonstrate that transmission XMCD spectroscopic imaging is a robust, quantitative technique to probe altermagnetic order, providing a means to probe individual altermagnetic domains within complex configurations. This ability to investigate, and characterise altermagnetic order in bulk crystals represents an important tool for the exploration of altermagnetism across a wide range of candidate materials, of key importance for the development of future technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What does materials science look like in the "Age of Artificial Intelligence?" Each materials domain-synthesis, characterization, and modeling-has a different answer to this question, motivated by unique challenges and constraints. This work focuses on the tremendous potential of autonomous characterization within electron microscopy. We present our recent advancements in developing domain-aware, multimodal models for microscopy analysis capable of describing complex atomic systems. We then address the critical gap between the theoretical promise of autonomous microscopy and its current practical limitations, showcasing recent successes while highlighting the necessary developments to achieve robust, real-world autonomy.</description>

      <title>Meta-GGA dielectric-dependent and range-separated screened hybrid functional for reliable prediction of material properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a range-separated hybrid exchange-correlation functional to calculate solid-state material properties. The functional mixes Hartree-Fock exchange with the semilocal exchange of the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) and the fraction of Hartree-Fock exchange is determined from the dielectric function. First-principles calculations and comparison with other meta-GGA approximations show that the functional leads to reasonably good performance for the band gap and optical properties. We also show that the present functional also successfully resolves the well-known ``band gap problem'' of narrow gap Cu-based semiconductors, such as Cu3SbSe4 and Cu3AsSe4, where, in general, a considerably large band inversion energy leads to a ``false'' negative or metallic band gap for all other methods. Furthermore, reasonable accuracy for the occupied d-bands and transition energies is also obtained for bulk solids. Thus, overall, our results demonstrate the predictive power of range-separated meta-GGA hybrid functionals for quantum materials simulations.</description>

      <title>Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition of MgGeN2 films on GaN and sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MgGeN2 films were synthesized using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on GaN/c-sapphire templates and c-plane sapphire substrates. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to estimate the cation composition ratios. To mitigate magnesium evaporation, the films were grown at pyrometer temperature 745 {\deg}C with a wafer rotation speed of 1000 rpm. Growth rates were determined by fitting energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy spectra to film thicknesses using NIST DTSA-II software. The thickness estimates determined by this method were consistent with scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements done for selected samples. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed faceted surfaces indicative of a tendency toward three-dimensional growth. X-ray diffraction spectra confirmed that the films were highly crystalline and exhibited preferential orientation in alignment with the substrate. Atomic force microscopy measurements show that film thicknesses are consistent across samples grown on both GaN templates and sapphire substrates, with typical roughnesses around 10 nm. Transmittance spectra of films grown on double-side-polished sapphire substrates yielded band gaps of 4.28 +- 0.06 eV for samples exhibiting close-to-ideal stoichiometry. Comparison of the measured spectra with ab initio calculations are in good agreement both near the band gap and at higher energies where excitation is into higher-lying bands. These findings provide insight into the growth and characterization of MgGeN2, contributing to the development of this material for potential applications in optoelectronics and power electronics.</description>

      <title>Theory of interaction-induced charge order in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CrSBr is a layered van der Waals insulator with a quasi one-dimensional electronic structure and in-plane ferromagnetic order. Recent experimental work on Li-doped CrSBr reveals quasi-1D charge modulated states. In this study, we develop ab initio effective models for CrSBr to investigate these states and solve them using mean-field theory and density matrix embedding theory. The models are parametrized using density functional theory, the constrained random phase approximation, and the Rytova-Keldysh form of the long-range Coulomb interaction. Our simulations indicate the emergence of a charge density wave state characterized by cosine-like intra-chain density modulations and inter-chain phase shifts that minimize the Coulomb repulsion. Notably, at a doping level corresponding to $1/n$ electron per CrSBr unit, the most stable pattern exhibits a periodicity of $n$ cells, in agreement with experimental observations and Peierls' instability arguments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inter-chain order is sensitive to the range of Coulomb interactions. If the interaction is hard-truncated to a short-ranged form, some localized stripe-like states are computationally favored. This work provides an ab initio framework for understanding the interplay of competing electronic and magnetic phases in CrSBr and related materials.</description>

      <title>Colossal magnetoresistance in a quasi-two-dimensional cluster glass semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a surge of interest in spintronics, the manipulation and detection of colossal magnetoresistance in quasi-two-dimensional layered magnetic materials have become a key focus, driven by their relatively scarce occurrence compared to giant magnetoresistance and tunneling magnetoresistance. This study presents an investigation into the desired colossal magnetoresistance, achieved by introducing magnetic frustration through Te doping in quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet Cr2Se3 matrix. The resulting Cr0.98SeTe0.27 exhibits cluster glass-like behavior with a freezing temperature of 28 K. Magnetotransport studies reveal a significant negative magnetoresistance of up to 32%. Additionally, angle-dependent transport measurements demonstrate a magnetic field-induced transition from positive to negative resistance anisotropy, suggesting a magnetic field-driven alteration in the electronic structure of this narrow band gap semiconductor, a characteristic feature of the colossal magnetoresistance effect. This behavior is further corroborated by density functional theory calculations. This systematic investigation provides a crucial understanding of the control of colossal magnetoresistance in quasi-two-dimensional materials via competing exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Critical scaling behavior in skyrmion host ferromagnet CrTe1.38</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials hosting diverse topological spin textures hold significant potential for spintronic applications. In this context, CrTe1.38, a quasi-two-dimensional material, stands out due to its stable N'eel-type skyrmion phase over a wide temperature range, both with and without an applied magnetic field [APL 125, 152402 (2024)]. Thus, it is a promising candidate for investigating complex magnetic phenomena, offering valuable insights into the underlying magnetic interactions. This study investigates the critical behavior of CrTe1.38 near TC by measuring DC magnetic isotherms. A systematic analysis of these isotherms with the magnetic field applied along the easy axis allows us to determine the asymptotic critical exponents: beta = 0.314, gamma = 1.069, and delta = 4.556, where the Widom scaling law and scaling equations are verified the self-consistency and reliability. In this system, the magnetic exchange coupling J(r) is the long-range type and decays spatially at a rate slower than approximately 4.651. Most notably, a series of vertical lines in the low-field region of the initial magnetization curves below TC supports the existence of a skyrmion phase in this compound</description>

      <title>Revisiting MnSe : a Magnetic Semiconductor with Spin-Phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-phonon interactions in 2D magnetic materials are crucial in advancing next-generation spintronic devices. Therefore, identifying new materials with significant spin-phonon interactions is of great importance. In this context, MnSe, previously recognized as an exemplary non-layered p-type semiconductor emerges in this study as an intriguing material with notable spin-phonon characteristics. The complex magnetism in pristine MnSe, primarily dominated by antiferromagnetism with a weak ferromagnetic component, gives rise to both spontaneous and conventional exchange bias effects at low temperatures. In an effort to understand this intriguing magnetism, we conducted a detailed Raman spectroscopy study, which reveals unconventional deviations from the usual phonon anharmonicity around Neel temperature (170 K), in the self-energies of the P1, P2, and P3 modes. Notably, the P1 mode is most sensitive to spin-phonon coupling, while the P2 mode is particularly responsive to the structural phase transition at 250 K. Therefore, these findings provide comprehensive insights into the phase transitions of pristine MnSe, particularly highlighting the previously unobserved interplay between its magnetic behavior and phonon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of Topological Nodal-Ring Phonons in Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological physics has evolved from its initial focus on fermionic systems to the exploration of bosonic systems, particularly phononic excitations in crystalline materials. Two-dimensional (2D) topological phonons emerge as promising candidates for future technological applications. Currently, experimental verification of 2D topological phonons has remained exclusively limited to graphene, a constraint that hinders their applications in phononic devices. Here, we report experimental evidence of topological phonons in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride using advanced high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. Our high-precision measurements explicitly demonstrate two topological nodal rings in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, protected by mirror symmetry, expanding the paradigm of 2D topological phonons beyond graphene. This research not only deepens fundamental understanding of 2D topological phonons, but also establishes a phononic device platform based on wide-bandgap insulators, crucial for advancements in electronics and photonics applications.</description>

Abstract: Pump-probe reflectivity measurements have been performed on a single crystal of tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) using ultrashort near-infrared pulses. The behavior is well reproduced in simulations superimposing three oscillations (7.45, 7.49 and 7.7 THz) with different phases. The Fourier transform spectrum features small peaks at 4.0 and 11.5 THz along with intense peaks at around 7.5 THz.</description>

      <title>Bridging Spectroscopy and Advanced Molecular Orientation Analysis with New 4+ Angle Polarization Toolbox in Quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropy plays a critical role in governing the mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of materials, influencing their behavior across diverse applications. Probing and quantifying this directional dependence is crucial for advancing materials science and biomedical research, as it provides a deeper understanding of structural orientations at the molecular level, encompassing both scientific and industrial benefits. This study introduces the "4+ Angle Polarization" widget, an innovative extension to the open-source Quasar platform (https://quasar.codes/), tailored for advanced multiple-angle polarization analysis. This toolbox enables precise molecular orientation analysis of complex microspectroscopic datasets through a streamlined workflow. Using polarized Fourier transform infrared (p-FTIR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate its versatility across various sample types, including polylactic acid (PLA) organic crystals, murine cortical bone, and human osteons. By overcoming the limitations of traditional two-angle methods, the widget significantly enhances the accuracy of structural and orientational analysis. This novel analytical tool expands the potential of multiple-angle p-FTIR techniques into advanced characterization of structural anisotropy in heterogeneous systems, providing transformative insights for materials characterization, biomedical imaging and beyond.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning a Phosphor's Excitation Band Position</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating superior lanthanide-activated inorganic phosphors is pivotal for advancing energy-efficient LED lighting and backlit flat panel displays. The most fundamental property these luminescent materials must possess is effective absorption/excitation by a blue InGaN LED for practical conversion into white light. The 5$d_1$ excited state energy level of lanthanides, which determines the excitation peak position, is influenced by the inorganic host structure, including the local environment, crystal structure, and composition, making it challenging to predict in advance. This study introduces a new extreme gradient boosting machine learning method that quantitatively determines a phosphor's longest (lowest energy) excitation wavelength. We focus on the Ce$^{3+}$ 4$f$ $\rightarrow$ 5$d$ transition due to its well-defined 5$d_1$ energy level observed in excitation and diffuse reflectance spectra. The model was trained on experimental data for 357 Ce$^{3+}$ cation substitution sites sourced from literature and in-house measurements and ultimately experimentally validated through the successful synthesis of a novel, blue-excited, green-emitting phosphor: Ca$_2$SrSc$_6$O$_{12}$:Ce$^{3+}$. This compound's excitation under commercial blue LED wavelength aligned remarkably well with the model's predictions. These results highlight the transformative potential of data-driven approaches in expediting the discovery of blue-absorbing phosphors for next-generation LED lighting.</description>

      <title>Exchange Coupling Modulation in MN4-Embedded Graphene Layers (M=Mn, Fe, Co, Cu) Under Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MN4-embedded graphene (MN4-G) layers, with transition metal elements M, are experimentally accessible two-dimensional (2D) materials and show great potential for stable nanoscale magnetization. In these materials, the exchange couplings between magnetic atoms are predominantly governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an unusual prolonged decay of r to the power of minus n, where r is the M-M separation distance, and n is between 0.5 and 2. In this paper, we explore the effects of induced strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers through ab-initio density functional theory. We employ a specific method to apply strain by positioning atoms from one layer within the equilibrium structure of another layer, thereby inducing strain in the form of either tension or compression. The induced strain results in an approximate plus/minus 0.4% variation in the unit-cell area of the MN4-G lattice. Our findings reveal that while the exchange coupling mechanism remains unaffected, the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling are significantly influenced by the induced strain. Notably, the CoN4-G layer exhibits a remarkable increase in the strength and oscillation amplitude of the RKKY coupling, along with a reduced decay rate. Additionally, the electronic and magnetic properties of the CuN4-G layers remain unchanged under induced strain.</description>

      <title>Reactive sputtering of SnS thin films using sulfur plasma and a metallic tin target: achieving stoichiometry and large grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel method for fabricating stoichiometric SnS thin films with large grain sizes via reactive sputtering using a metallic Sn target and sulfur plasma (S-plasma). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on toxic H2S gas, this method employs a S-plasma to enhance sulfur reactivity and mitigate sulfur deficiencies during film deposition. By optimizing the balance between the sputtering conditions of the Sn target and the supply conditions of the S-plasma, dense single-phase SnS thin films with micron-scale grain sizes were achieved at a substrate temperature of 300 degree C, achieving an in-plane Hall mobility of 13 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, crystalline SnS thin films were fabricated even on a room-temperature substrate, enabling potential applications in flexible devices with heat-sensitive substrates. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of S-plasma in advancing SnS thin film fabrication, providing a safer and more efficient route to high-performance photovoltaic materials.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic resonance in $\alpha$-MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic resonance in a bulk $\alpha$-MnTe crystal is investigated using both frequency-domain and time-domain THz spectroscopy techniques. At low temperatures, an excitation at the photon energy of 3.5 meV is observed and identified as a magnon mode through its distinctive dependence on temperature and magnetic field. This behavior is reproduced using a simplified model for antiferromagnetic resonance in an easy-plane antiferromagnet, enabling the extraction of the out-of-plane component of the single-ion magnetic anisotropy reaching (40 $\pm$ 10) $\mu$eV.</description>

      <title>Influence of Chemistry and Topography on the Wettability of Copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the complex interplay of topography and surface chemistry in wetting, fundamental studies investigating both parameters are needed. Due to the sensitivity of wetting to miniscule changes in one of the parameters it is imperative to precisely control the experimental approach. A profound understanding of their influence on wetting facilitates a tailored design of surfaces with unique functionality. We present a multi-step study: The influence of surface chemistry is analyzed by determining the adsorption of volatile carbonous species (A) and by sputter deposition of metallic copper and copper oxides on flat copper substrates (B). A precise surface topography is created by laser processing. Isotropic topography is created by ps laser processing (C), and hierarchical anisotropic line patterns are produced by direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) with different pulse durations (D). Our results reveal that the long-term wetting response of polished copper surfaces stabilizes with time despite ongoing accumulation of hydrocarbons and is dominated by this adsorption layer over the oxide state of the substrate (Cu, CuO, Cu2O). The surfaces' wetting response can be precisely tuned by tailoring the topography via laser processing. The sub-pattern morphology of primary line-like patterns showed great impact on the static contact angle, wetting anisotropy, and water adhesion. An increased roughness inside the pattern valleys combined with a minor roughness on the peaks favors air-inclusions, isotropic hydrophobicity, and low water adhesion. Increasing the aspect ratio showed to enhance air-inclusions and hydrophobicity despite increased peak roughness while time dependent wetting transitions were observed.</description>

      <title>High-Pressure Tuning of Electrical Transport in Freestanding Oxide Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical transport of oxide films under high pressure is largely unexplored due to the absence of a universal strategy. In this work, we have developed an in-house route to investigate the electrical transport properties of oxide films under high pressures, by improving the elasticity of freestanding oxide films and the robustness of high-pressure techniques on nano-devices. As a showcase, we investigated the electrical resistivity of perovskite SrIrO3 films under high pressures, and found a pressure-driven semimetal-to-insulator transition and an insulator-to-metal transition. At the monolayer-limit, the SrIrO3 films directly transform from an insulating state to a metallic state, highlighting the intriguing interplay of dimensionality and hydrostatic pressure in correlated oxides, which can be unveiled through the universal high-pressure strategy.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Refractory Transition-Metal Nitride Films for Advanced Electronics and Plasmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of semiconductor materials has played a crucial role in the development of electronic and optical devices. However, scaling down semiconductor devices to the nanoscale has imposed limitations on device properties due to quantum effects. Hence, the search for successor materials has become a central focus in the fields of materials science and physics. Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are extraordinary materials known for their outstanding stability, biocompatibility, and ability to integrate with semiconductors. Over the past few decades, TMNs have been extensively employed in various fields. However, the synthesis of single-crystal TMNs has long been challenging, hindering the advancement of their high-performance electronics and plasmonics. Fortunately, progress in film deposition techniques has enabled the successful epitaxial growth of high-quality TMN films. In comparison to reported reviews, there is a scarcity of reviews on epitaxial TMN films from the perspective of materials physics and condensed matter physics, particularly at the atomic level. Therefore, this review aims to provide a brief summary of recent progress in epitaxial growth at atomic precision, emergent physical properties (superconductivity, magnetism, ferroelectricity, and plasmon), and advanced electronic and plasmonic devices associated with epitaxial TMN films.</description>

      <title>Stronger femtosecond excitation causes slower electron-phonon coupling in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-hole pairs in semiconductors are essential for solar cells and fast electronic circuitry, but the competition between carrier transport and relaxation into heat limits the efficiency and speed. Here we use ultrafast electron diffraction with terahertz pulse compression to measure the electron-phonon decay rate in single-crystal silicon as a function of laser excitation strength. We find that the excited electrons relax slower into phonons for higher carrier densities. The electron-phonon scattering rate changes in a nonlinear way from 400 fs at ~$2 \times 10^{20} \text{ cm}^{-3}$ to 1.2 ps at ~$4 \times 10^{20} \text{ cm}^{-3}$. These results indicate that a hot electron gas quenches the scattering into phonons in a temperature-dependent way. Ultrafast electronic circuitry of silicon therefore should work faster and provide higher bandwidths at lower carrier densities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced deep-freezing magneto- and elasto-caloric effects by modifying lattice anharmonicity and electronic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing the high performance magneto or elastocaloric effect in NiMnIn alloys with spin-lattice coupling in a deep freezing temperature range of 200 K to 255 K is challenging due to the limited lattice entropy change and large negative contribution of magnetic entropy change during phase transitions. In this work, we systematically study the first order magneto-structural transition in NiMnIn based alloys by in-situ microstructural characterizations, physical property measurements, and first principles calculations. A multi element alloying strategy involving Cu and Ga co doping is proposed to manipulate the phase transition. The co doping reduces the lattice anharmonicity and thermal expansion coefficient of the martensitic phase, leading to an increase in the unit cell volume change and lattice entropy change. It also modifies the electronic density of states, causing a decrease in the magnetization change .The relief of the lattice mismatch reduces hysteresis losses in the refrigeration cycle. These synergetic effects yield excellent magneto and elastocaloric effects,with the effective magnetocaloric refrigeration capacity reaching up to 182 J/kg under the magnetic field of 5 T or an adiabatic temperature change of -4 K under a low field of 1.5 T and the elastocaloric coefficient of performance to 30 or an adiabatic temperature change of -7 K with the strain of 5% at 230 K, offering a potential solution for solid-state deep-freezing refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Spatial Mixing of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials for Materials Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer near first-principles accuracy but are computationally expensive, limiting their application in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, we present ML-MIX, an efficient and flexible LAMMPS package for accelerating simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities. Through constrained linear fitting, we show it is possible to generate a 'cheap' approximate model which closely matches an 'expensive' reference in relevant regions of configuration space. We demonstrate the capability of ML-MIX through case-studies in Si, Fe, and W-He systems, achieving up to an 11x speedup on 8,000 atom systems without sacrificing accuracy on static and dynamic quantities, including calculation of minimum energy paths and dynamical simulations of defect diffusion. For larger domain sizes, we show that the achievable speedup of ML-MIX simulations is limited only by the relative speed of the cheap potential over the expensive potential. The ease of use and flexible nature of this method will extend the practical reach of MLIPs throughout computational materials science, enabling parsimonious application to large spatial and temporal domains.</description>

      <title>Quantifying local heterogeneities in the 3D morphology of X-PVMPT battery electrodes based on FIB-SEM measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic electrode-active materials (OAMs) not only enable a variety of charge and storage mechanisms, but are also safer for the environment and of lower cost compared to materials in commonly used lithium-ion batteries. Cross-linked Poly(3)-vinyl-N-methylphenothiazine (X-PVMPT) is a p-type OAM which shows high performance and enables fast and reversible energy storage in different battery configurations. The performance of an OAM does not only depend on its molecular or polymer structure, but also on the structure of the composite electrode. The porous nanostructure of an electrode composed of X-PVMPT, a conductive carbon additive and binder is investigated by statistical image analysis, based on 3D image data obtained by focused-ion beam scanning-electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) measurements. Univariate probability distributions of relevant morphological descriptors as well as bivariate distributions of pairs of such descriptors are parametrically modelled, among others, by utilization of copulas in the latter case. These models are then used for quantifying local heterogeneities of X-PVMPT considered in this paper. Furthermore, it is shown that the nanostructure changes when traversing from bottom to top face of the electrode, which influences its performance. While the observed short transportation paths trough the solid phase are beneficial in terms of electrical conductivity, the pathways through the pore phase influencing the effective ionic diffusivity are--in comparison--rather long.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic anisotropy and magnetoelastic properties of the magnetic Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa were investigated by exploiting the Co2MnGa thin films with different chemical orderings. The epitaxial layers were grown by sputtering directly on MgO (001) and the annealing temperatures after the deposition were varied, which allowed us to change the chemical ordering of Co2MnGa. We observed a clear relationship between the annealing temperature and the parameters of magnetic property. The most significant changes of both the magnetic anisotropy and the magnetoelastic properties were correlated with the appearance of the L21 ordered phase, suggesting that the emergence of magnetic Weyl semimetallic feature is the key point to vary these magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Origin of Enhanced Performance when Mn-Rich Rocksalt Cathodes transform to $\delta$-DRX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Mn-rich cathodes are known to undergo phase transformation into structures resembling spinel-like ordering upon electrochemical cycling. Recently, the irreversible transformation of Ti-containing Mn-rich disordered rock-salt cathodes into a phase -- named $\delta$ -- with nanoscale spinel-like domains has been shown to increase energy density, capacity retention, and rate capability. However, the nature of the boundaries between domains and their relationship with composition and electrochemistry are not well understood. In this work, we discuss how the transformation into the multi-domain structure results in eight variants of Spinel domains, which is crucial for explaining the nanoscale domain formation in the $\delta$-phase. We study the energetics of crystallographically unique boundaries and the possibility of Li-percolation across them with a fine-tuned CHGNet machine learning interatomic potential. Energetics of $16d$ vacancies reveal a strong affinity to segregate to the boundaries, thereby opening Li-pathways at the boundary to enhance long-range Li-percolation in the $\delta$ structure. Defect calculations of the relatively low-mobility Ti show how it can influence the extent of Spinel ordering, domain morphology and size significantly; leading to guidelines for engineering electrochemical performance through changes in composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscopic heterogeneities in composition and structure are quintessential for the properties of electrocatalyst materials. Here, we present a semiclassical model to study the electrochemical properties of supported electrocatalyst nanoparticles (NP). The model captures the correlated electronic and ionic equilibration across NP, support, and electrolyte. It reveals peculiar trends in surface charging of the supported NP, validated by comparison with first-principles calculations. Support-induced perturbations in electronic and ionic charge densities at the NP's active surface manifest as distinct potentials of zero local electronic and ionic charges that could differ by more than 0.5 V in the studied system.</description>

      <title>How to choose efficiently the size of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation Hamiltonian for accurate exciton calculations on supercells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is the workhorse method to study excitons in materials. The size of the BSE Hamiltonian, that is how many valence to conduction band transitions are considered in those calculations, needs to be chosen to be sufficiently large to converge excitons' energies and wavefunctions but should be minimized to make calculations tractable, as BSE calculations scale with the number of atoms as $ (N_{\rm{atoms}}^6)$. In particular, in the case of supercell (SC) calculations composed of $N_{\rm{rep}}$ replicas of the primitive cell (PC), a natural choice to build this BSE Hamiltonian is to include all transitions from PC calculations by zone folding. However, this greatly increases the size of the BSE Hamiltonian, as the number of matrix elements in it is $(N_k N_c N_v)^2$, where $N_k$ is the number of $k$-points, and $N_{c(v)}$ is the number of conduction (valence) states. The number of $k$-points decreases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}$ but both the number of conduction and valence states increase by the same factor, therefore the BSE Hamiltonian increases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}^2$, making exactly corresponding calculations prohibitive. Here we provide an analysis to decide how many transitions are necessary to achieve comparable results. With our method, we show that to converge with an energy tolerance of 0.1 eV the first exciton binding energy of a LiF SC composed of 64 PCs, we only need 12\% of the valence to conduction transitions that are given by zone folding. We also show that exciton energies are much harder to converge than Random Phase Approximation transition energies, underscoring the necessity of careful convergence studies. The procedure in our work helps in evaluating excitonic properties in large SC calculations such as defects, self-trapped excitons, polarons, and interfaces.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing imaging and hyperspectral data is crucial across scientific fields, including biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The primary goal is to transform high-resolution or high-dimensional data into an interpretable format to generate actionable insights, aiding decision-making and advancing knowledge. Currently, this task relies on complex, human-designed workflows comprising iterative steps such as denoising, spatial sampling, keypoint detection, feature generation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolutions. The introduction of machine learning over the past decade has accelerated tasks like image segmentation and object detection via supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction via unsupervised methods. However, both classical and NN-based approaches still require human input, whether for hyperparameter tuning, data labeling, or both. The growing use of automated imaging tools, from atomically resolved imaging to biological applications, demands unsupervised methods that optimize data representation for human decision-making or autonomous experimentation. Here, we discuss advances in reward-based workflows, which adopt expert decision-making principles and demonstrate strong transfer learning across diverse tasks. We represent image analysis as a decision-making process over possible operations and identify desiderata and their mappings to classical decision-making frameworks. Reward-driven workflows enable a shift from supervised, black-box models sensitive to distribution shifts to explainable, unsupervised, and robust optimization in image analysis. They can function as wrappers over classical and DCNN-based methods, making them applicable to both unsupervised and supervised workflows (e.g., classification, regression for structure-property mapping) across imaging and hyperspectral data.</description>

      <title>Growth and characterization of single crystal cubic TaN and hexagonal Ta$_2$N films on c-plane Sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two single crystal phases of tantalum nitride were stabilized on c-plane sapphire using molecular beam epitaxy. The phases were identified to be $\delta$-TaN with a rocksalt cubic structure and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N with a hexagonal structure. Atomic force microscopy scans revealed smooth surfaces for both the films with root mean square roughnesses less than 0.3 nm. Phase-purity of these films was determined by x-ray diffraction. Raman spectrum of the phase-pure $\delta$-TaN and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N obtained will serve as a future reference to determine phase-purity of tantalum nitride films. Further, the room-temperature and low-temperature electronic transport measurements indicated that both of these phases are metallic at room temperature with resistivities of 586.2 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 75.5 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film and become superconducting below 3.6 K and 0.48 K respectively. The superconducting transition temperature reduces with applied magnetic field as expected. Ginzburg-Landau fitting revealed a 0 K critical magnetic field and coherence length of 18 T and 4.2 nm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 96 mT and 59 nm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film. These tantalum nitride films are of high interest for superconducting resonators and qubits.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Inverse Design for Nanowire Single-Photon Avalanche Detectors via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) have enabled various applications in emerging photonic quantum information technologies in recent years. However, despite many efforts to improve SPAD's performance, the design of SPADs remained largely an iterative and time-consuming process where a designer makes educated guesses of a device structure based on empirical reasoning and solves the semiconductor drift-diffusion model for it. In contrast, the inverse problem, i.e., directly inferring a structure needed to achieve desired performance, which is of ultimate interest to designers, remains an unsolved problem. We propose a novel physics-aware inverse design workflow for SPADs using a deep learning model and demonstrate it with an example of finding the key parameters of semiconductor nanowires constituting the unit cell of an SPAD, given target photon detection efficiency. Our inverse design workflow is not restricted to the case demonstrated and can be applied to design conventional planar structure-based SPADs, photodetectors, and solar cells.</description>

      <title>Light-Emitting Microfibers from Lotus Root for Eco-friendly Optical Waveguides and Biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical biosensors based on micro-/nano-fibers are highly valuable for probing and monitoring liquid environments and bioactivity. Most of current optical biosensors, however, are still based on glass, semiconductors, or metallic materials, which might be not fully suited for biologically-relevant environments. Here, we introduce biocompatible and flexible microfibers from Lotus silk as micro-environmental monitors that exhibit waveguiding of intrinsic fluorescence as well as of coupled light. These features make single-filament monitors excellent building blocks for a variety of sensing functions, including pH-probing and detection of bacterial activity. These results pave the way for the development of new and entirely eco-friendly, potentially multiplexed biosensing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a path integral-inspired formalism for computing the quantum thermal expectation values of spins, when subject to magnetic fields that can be time-dependent and can accommodate the presence of Heisenberg exchange interactions between the spins. This generalises the formalism presented in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)] and paves the way towards the realisation of large-scale atomistic simulations, for which this method should reveal its true efficiency gains, when compared to exact quantum methods. We compare our results with exact/numerical diagonalisation methods, where possible, to confirm the range of accuracy of our model.</description>

      <title>Design of Resistive Frequency Selective Surface based Radar Absorbing Structure-A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, deep learning-based approach for the design of radar absorbing structure using resistive frequency selective surface is proposed. In the present design, reflection coefficient is used as input of deep learning model and the Jerusalem cross based unit cell dimensions is predicted as outcome. Sequential neural network based deep learning model with adaptive moment estimation optimizer is used for designing multi frequency band absorbers. The model is used for designing radar absorber from L to Ka band depending on unit cell parameters and thickness. The outcome of deep learning model is further compared with full-wave simulation software and an excellent match is obtained. The proposed model can be used for the low-cost design of various radar absorbing structures using a single unit cell and thickness across the band of frequencies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Scalability and Applicability of Kohn-Sham Hamiltonians for Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%. These substantial improvements set new benchmarks for achieving accurate and applicable predictions in larger molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Operando XPS in Reactive Plasmas: The Importance of The Wall Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in differential pumping and electron optics over the past few decades have enabled x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements at (near-)ambient pressures, bridging the pressure gap for characterizing realistic sample chemistries. Recently, we demonstrated the capabilities of an ambient pressure XPS (APXPS) setup for in-situ plasma environment measurements, allowing plasma-surface interactions to be studied in operando rather than using the traditional before-and-after analysis approach. This new plasma-XPS technique facilitates the identification of reaction intermediates critical for understanding plasma-assisted surface processes relevant to semiconductor nanomanufacturing, such as physical vapor deposition, etching, atomic layer deposition, etc. In this report, we apply the plasma-XPS approach to monitor real-time surface chemical changes on a model Ag(111) single crystal exposed to oxidizing and reducing plasmas. We correlate surface-sensitive data with concurrent gas-phase XPS measurements and residual gas mass-spectra analysis of species generated during plasma exposure, highlighting the significant role of plasma-induced chamber wall reactions. Ultimately, we demonstrate that plasma-XPS provides comprehensive insights into both surface and gas-phase chemistry, establishing it as a versatile and dynamic characterization tool with broad applications in microelectronics research.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial high-K AlBN barrier GaN HEMTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a polarization-induced 2D electron gas (2DEG) at an epitaxial AlBN/GaN heterojunction grown on a SiC substrate. Using this 2DEG in a long conducting channel, we realize ultra-thin barrier AlBN/GaN high electron mobility transistors that exhibit current densities of more than 0.25 A/mm, clean current saturation, a low pinch-off voltage of -0.43 V, and a peak transconductance of 0.14 S/mm. Transistor performance in this preliminary realization is limited by the contact resistance. Capacitance-voltage measurements reveal that introducing 7 % B in the epitaxial AlBN barrier on GaN boosts the relative dielectric constant of AlBN to 16, higher than the AlN dielectric constant of 9. Epitaxial high-K barrier AlBN/GaN HEMTs can thus extend performance beyond the capabilities of current GaN transistors.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric moment encodes stacking order of moir\'e matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the topological characteristics of electronic bands is essential in condensed matter physics. Moir\'e materials featuring flat bands provide a versatile platform for engineering band topology and correlation effects. In moir\'e materials that break either time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry or both, electronic bands exhibit Berry curvature hotspots. Different stacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature distributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains similar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on the quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4$^\circ$ twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB-AB, AB-BA) and forms an inversion broken \moire superlattice with electrically tunable flat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking order, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in Berry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD exhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the perpendicular electric field in AB-AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric behavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity in AB-BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking-induced quantum geometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered phase of collinear magnet called, altermagnet breaks time reversal symmetry (TRS), exhibits momentum-dependent spin-splitting of band structure with zero net magnetization. In this work, we theoretically investigate the Josephson junction (JJ) of spin singlet superconductor (SC)/altermagnet/spin triplet SC and demonstrate that it manifests field free Josephson diode effect (JDE). We illustrate that there are four key requisites to have JDE in such JJs, namely, broken TRS, left and right SC in the JJ shall be non-identical, presence of spin orbit interaction, and anisotropy in spin polarization at the Fermi surface or anisotropy in pair potential of the SC. It has also been shown that by applying a gate potential in the altermagnetic regime, one can not only reverse the sign of efficiency but also modulate its magnitude. Our system can be used as a superconducting rectifier that can be tuned efficiently using gate voltage and system parameters without having external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>High-chirality Weyl nodes in hexagonal ReO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of two-band nodal points in gapless topological phases, referred to as conventional Weyl nodes, relies solely on translational symmetry. However, when coupled with other spatial and spatio-temporal symmetries, unconventional Weyl nodes with high degeneracy, pronounced chirality, and complementary quaternion charges can manifest. In this work, we identify ReO3 as an ideal unconventional Weyl semimetal in which rotation and screw symmetries as well as their combination with time-reversal symmetry play a crucial role. To show this, we first revisit in detail the algebraic determination of the chirality of Weyl nodes from the spinful irreducible representations of the occupied and unoccupied bands, and then combine it with the complementary C2T-symmetry-protected patch Euler class and non-Abelian frame charges that indicates the pinning of the Weyl nodes on C2T-invariant planes. Supporting our findings with first-principles calculations, we furthermore reveal very clear Fermi arc signatures of the high-chirality Weyl nodes at the Fermi level for different surface orientations. We finally investigate the effect of strain upon which the robustness of Weyl nodes clearly demonstrates their Chern (i.e. chirality conservation) and quaternionic (i.e. symmetry-plane pinning) topological nature.</description>

      <title>Group Conductivity and Nonadiabatic Born Effective Charges of Disordered Metals, Warm Dense Matter, and Hot Dense Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity," that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research has demonstrated that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine-tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto- and picosecond timescales of silica polymerisation and depolymerisation, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an ultrafast laser synthesis technique capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light-matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively freezing structures at any stage of self-assembly. Using this approach, we traced the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser-synthesized TPA-silicate-1 zeolites, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.</description>

Abstract: Moire patterns in van der Waals bilayer materials complicate the analysis of atomic-resolution images, hindering the atomic-scale insight typically attainable with scanning transmission electron microscopy. Here, we report a method to detect the positions and identities of atoms in each of the individual layers that compose twisted bilayer heterostructures. We developed a deep learning model, Gomb-Net, which identifies the coordinates and atomic species in each layer, effectively deconvoluting the moire pattern. This enables layer-specific mapping of quantities like strain and dopant distributions, unlike other commonly used segmentation models which struggle with moire-induced complexity. Using this approach, we explored the Se atom substitutional site distribution in a twisted fractional Janus WS2-WS2(1-x)Se2x heterostructure and found that layer-specific implantation sites are unaffected by the moire pattern's local energetic or electronic modulation. This advancement enables atom identification within material regimes where it was not possible before, opening new insights into previously inaccessible material physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Table-top three-dimensional photoemission orbital tomography with a femtosecond extreme ultraviolet light source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).</description>

      <title>Renormalized density matrix downfolding: A rigorous framework in learning emergent models from ab initio many-body calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalized framework, renormalized density matrix downfolding (RDMD), to derive systematically improvable, highly accurate, and nonperturbative effective models from ab initio calculations. This framework moves beyond the common role of ab initio calculations as calculating the parameters of a proposed Hamiltonian. Instead, RDMD provides the capability to decide whether a given effective Hilbert space can be identified from the ab initio data and assess the relative quality of ansatz Hamiltonians. Any method of ab initio solution can be used as a data source, and as the ab initio solutions improve, the resultant model also improves. We demonstrate the framework in an application to the downfolding of a hydrogen chain to a spin model, in which we find the interatomic separations for which a nonperturbative mapping can be made even in the strong coupling regime where standard methods fail, and compute a renormalized spin model Hamiltonian that quantitatively reproduces the ab initio dynamics.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the current research of finding $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at and above $300$ K is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of other effects and phenomena including phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics aims to explore quantum features to enhance energy conversion beyond classical limits. While significant progress has been made, the understanding of caloric potentials in quantum systems remains incomplete. In this context, this study focuses on deriving general expressions for these caloric potentials, by developing a quantum Maxwell relationship obtained from a thermal average form of the Ehrenfest theorem. Our results recover the classical cases and also reveal that the isothermal entropy change can be related to genuine quantum correlations in the system. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the understanding of the caloric behavior of quantum systems and their potential implication in caloric devices.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient field-free unconventional spin-orbit torque magnetization switching dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials offers a promising platform for efficient control of magnetization dynamics for non-volatile spin-based devices. However, energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and spin dynamics experiments to understand the basic SOT phenomena in all-2D vdW heterostructures are so far lacking. Here, we demonstrate energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and tunable magnetization dynamics in a vdW heterostructure comprising out-of-plane magnet Fe3GaTe2 and topological Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. We measured the non-linear second harmonic Hall signal in TaIrTe4 /Fe3GaTe2 devices to evaluate the SOT-induced magnetization dynamics, which is characterized by a large and tunable out-of-plane damping-like torque. Energy-efficient and deterministic field-free SOT magnetization switching is achieved at room temperature with a very low current density. First-principles calculations unveil the origin of the unconventional charge-spin conversion phenomena, considering the crystal symmetry and electronic structure of TaIrTe4. These results establish that all-vdW heterostructures provide a promising route to energy-efficient, field-free, and tunable SOT-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal spectrometer for superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Magnetization texture imprints produced by flux avalanches in ferromagnet/insulator/superconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic textures generated by a perpendicularly applied magnetic field at the ferromagnetic layer of $Co/Al_{2}O_{3}/Nb$ thin film heterostructures are investigated using magneto-optical imaging and micromagnetic simulations. It is observed that the stray field caused by flux avalanches in the superconducting layer prints out a non-trivial in-plane texture in the cobalt layer, which remains stable up to temperatures much above the Nb critical temperature. These textures mimic quite closely the dendritic thermomagnetic flux avalanches that penetrate the Nb layer from its edges. For low cobalt thickness, the filamentary magnetic textures occur in pairs with opposite polarity. The previous in-plane magnetization determines the relative location of the magnetic filaments with respect to the avalanche position. Micromagnetic simulations solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation confirm the interpretation given for the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>
