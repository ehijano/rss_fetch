      <title>AMBER: Algorithm for Multiplexing spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the art neutron spectrometers enable simultaneous measurements of high-dimensional datasets, allowing for a large collection rate of dynamic material properties. In this paper, we present the Algorithm for Multiplexing spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence (AMBER), which is a segmentation algorithm designed to decompose measured neutron scattering data into model-agnostic foreground and background contributions. The method takes advantage of the fact that background and foreground signals are measured simultaneously during the data collection process, relying on rotational independence of background contributions. The algorithm, initially developed for multiplexing neutron spectrometers, aims to strongly reduce time consuming expert input, therefore promoting full data set usage while minimizing the source of systematic errors.</description>

      <title>Measurement of photo- and radio-luminescence of thin ThF4 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted measurements on the photo- and radio-luminescence of thin ThF$_4$ films in both the UV and visible ranges. In the UV range, we found that both luminescences are at a similar level as the internal dark counting noise of the photo-multiplier-tube (PMT). Our results suggest that thin ThF$_4$ crystals could be used as a target for the search for $^{229m}$Th and as a medium for the future nuclear clock. The measurements indicate that using a small and thin ThF$_4$ film can reduce background noise while maintaining the signal at the same level, achieved by increasing the $^{229}$Th enrichment. Our developed apparatus is now ready for direct measurements of $^{229m}$Th excitation and decay in ThF$_4$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Delivered Spill Structure of Medical Proton and Carbon-Ion Beams at MedAustron using a High Frequency Silicon Carbide Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical synchrotrons are often used for testing instrumentation in high-energy physics or non-clinical research in medical physics. In many applications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging, precise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is crucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical settings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time, making single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address these limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide (SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of detecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse duration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the spill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation room beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the synchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity at small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for high-flux beam monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Spatial-Physics Informed Model for 3D Spiral Sample Scanned by SQUID Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy. The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii) magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%. Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.</description>

      <title>The study of 4H-SiC LGAD after proton radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is a promising material for radiation monitoring in harsh environments, due to its low dark current, high breakdown voltage, high thermal conductivity, and radiation hardness.~This work investigates a SiC-based Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD), named SICAR, with a gain factor of~2 to 3, under 80 MeV proton irradiation up to $1\times 10^{14}$~$n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. Electrical characterization via I-V, C-V, and $\alpha$ particle injection reveals an increase in threshold voltage and a 2 to 4 order of magnitude reduction in leakage current, while charge collection efficiency decreases by about 50\%. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and capacitance deep-level transient spectroscopy (C-DLTS) were employed to characterize the lattice structure and deep-level defects before and after irradiation. Deep-level defect characteristics were integrated into TCAD simulations to develop an electrical degradation model for SiC LGADs. A linear defect-flux relationship is established in the model, showing agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Design and Development of an Automated Contact Angle Tester (ACAT) for Surface Wettability Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Automated Contact Angle Tester (ACAT) is a fully integrated robotic work cell developed to automate the measurement of surface wettability on 3D-printed materials. Designed for precision, repeatability, and safety, ACAT addresses the limitations of manual contact angle testing by combining programmable robotics, precise liquid dispensing, and a modular software-hardware architecture. The system is composed of three core subsystems: (1) an electrical system including power, control, and safety circuits compliant with industrial standards such as NEC 70, NFPA 79, and UL 508A; (2) a software control system based on a Raspberry Pi and Python, featuring fault detection, GPIO logic, and operator interfaces; and (3) a mechanical system that includes a 3-axis Cartesian robot, pneumatic actuation, and a precision liquid dispenser enclosed within a safety-certified frame. The ACAT enables high-throughput, automated surface characterization and provides a robust platform for future integration into smart manufacturing and materials discovery workflows. This paper details the design methodology, implementation strategies, and system integration required to develop the ACAT platform.</description>

      <title>A low-background setup for in-situ X-ray total scattering combined with fast scanning calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a setup combining fast scanning calorimetry with X-ray total scattering at a synchrotron beamline, allowing for \emph{in-situ} characterizations of the nano-scale structure of samples during and after temperature scans. The setup features a portable vacuum chamber giving high signal-to-background ratio even on amorphous samples, which enables the observation of detailed structural changes between different sample states. We show three use cases, including one which leverages the high cooling rate of 10$^4$\,K/s achievable by this setup. Our demonstration opens the door to various applications in materials science where it is important to understand the interplay between structure and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>A waveform and time digitization mainboard prototype for the hybrid digital optical module of TRIDENT neutrino experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TRIDENT (Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope) experiment is a next-generation underwater neutrino observatory planned for deployment in the West Pacific Ocean, designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation. The full-scale detector will consist of approximately 1000 vertical strings, each equipped with 20 hybrid digital optical modules (hDOMs) containing both photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for comprehensive light detection. This paper presents a custom-designed digitization mainboard prototype for the hDOM, featuring simultaneous 32-channel PMT waveform digitization at 125 MS/s using commercial analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and 56-channel high-precision time measurement through field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-implemented time-to-digital converters (TDCs). The system demonstrates excellent performance in single photoelectron (SPE) detection with clear pedestal separation, maintains linear response up to 240 PEs, and achieves sub-nanosecond timing resolution for PMT or SiPM pulse edges.</description>

      <title>The application of Hough transform for fast interaction vertex position estimation in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charged particle track reconstruction in silicon detectors of collider experiments in high-multiplicity events, such as heavy-ion collisions at LHC, is a difficult and resource-demanding process. The first phase of the procedure is the formation of seeds composed out of a few signals per track. A high number of actual particles results in a combinatorial explosion of the number of seeds. A priori knowledge of the collision vertex position would allow discarding non-viable track seeds early in the reconstruction procedure, reducing the overall computing requirements for the track reconstruction. The method proposed in this paper uses the Hough transform for estimating the position of the interaction vertex without the necessity of reconstructing the tracks first. It offers admissible resolution with linear scaling of numerical complexity with the multiplicity of tracks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantify how squeezed light can reduce quantum measurement noise to levels below the standard quantum limit in impulse measurements with mechanical detectors. The broadband nature of the signal implies that frequency-dependent squeezing performs better than frequency-independent squeezing. We calculate the optimal scaling of the impulse sensitivity with the squeezing strength, and quantify degradations due to photodetection losses. Even for lossless measurement, we find there exists a fundamental limit to the benefit of squeezing that depends only on the system's mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Electron-ion recombination in composite interactions in liquid xenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The response of liquid xenon to various types of ionizing radiation has been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally. Recent progress in direct detection dark matter experiments highlights the significance of composite events, where multiple particles interact with xenon simultaneously and generate overlapping ionization signatures. In these events, recombination of electrons and ions associated with different primary particles leads to additional suppression of the ionization signal, introducing a new source of uncertainty in dark matter searches and Migdal effect studies. We developed a model to estimate the recombination enhancement for overlapping low-energy particle interactions. This method, which has minimal dependence on xenon microphysics and is primarily driven by existing experimental data, yields predictions that are consistent with available measurements of composite interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model predictions are robust against xenon microphysics assumptions.</description>
