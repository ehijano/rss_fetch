      <title>Orbital-doublet-driven even spin Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators hosting edge spin currents hold great potential for low-power spintronic devices. In this work, we present a universal approach to achieve a high and near-quantized spin Hall conductance plateau within a sizable bulk gap. Using a nonmagnetic four-band model Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that an even spin Chern (ESC) insulator can be accessed by tuning the sign of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) within a crystal symmetry-enforced orbital doublet. With the assistance of a high spin Chern number of $C_{S}=2$ and spin $U$(1) quasi-symmetry, this orbital-doublet-driven ESC phase is endowed with the near-double-quantized spin Hall conductance. We identify 12 crystallographic point groups supporting such a sign-tunable SOC. Furthermore, we apply our theory to realistic examples, and show the phase transition from a trivial insulator governed by positive SOC in RuI$_{3}$ monolayer to an ESC insulator dominated by negative SOC in RuBr$_{3}$ monolayer. This orbital-doublet-driven ESC insulator, RuBr$_{3}$, showcases nontrivial characteristics including helical edge states, near-double-quantized spin Hall conductance, and robust corner states. Our work provides new pathways in the pursuit of the long-sought quantum spin Hall insulators.</description>

      <title>An investigation on electronic and magnetic properties of Cr substituted MoS$_2$ monolayer and multilayers-Hybrid functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With help of ab initio density functional theory calculation, DFT+U, and hybrid functional HSE06, we revisit the layer dependent electronic structure and magnetic properties of pristine and 3d transition metal Cr doped MoS$_2$ monolayer and multilayers. Our results show that the dopant Cr atoms prefer to stay at nearest neighbor distances. In the multilayers, they prefer to remain in the outermost surface layers. Matching with the experimental band gap, the optimized U parameter we report is 4 eV. The band gap of the Cr doped monolayer is indirect, confirming the experimental observation from photoluminescence experiments. The HSE06 calculation for Cr doped monolayer shows that the band gap of doped Cr MoS$_2$ monolayer is indirect and no magnetism is observed. From the DFT studies, the band gap for the multilayers is indirect, and doping with Cr does not induce magnetic moments in MoS$_2$ layers. The band gap is observed to decrease with the multilayer thickness. The strain induced by substitutional Cr doping at the Mo site transforms the band gap in monolayer MoS$_2$ from direct to indirect. The defect states are produced within the band gap region close to the conduction band minimum.</description>

      <title>All van der Waals three-terminal SOT-MRAM realized by topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Luminescence properties and phase transformation of broadband NIR emitting A2(WO4)3:Cr3+ (A=Al3+, Sc3+) phosphors toward NIR spectroscopy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis, structural, and luminescence properties have been carried out for Cr3+-activated Al2(WO4)3 (AWO) and Sc2(WO4)3 (SWO) phosphors for application in pc-NIR LED. Upon blue excitation, these compounds are capable of exhibiting broadband NIR emission stems primarily from 4T2--&gt;4A2 transition in the range of 670-1200 nm (maxima ~808 nm, FWHM ~140 nm) for AWO:Cr and of 700-1300 nm (maxima ~870 nm, FWHM ~164 nm) for SWO:Cr. The significant shift of NIR emission is attributed to the substitution of AlO6 with larger ScO6 octahedrons. To gain insight into the luminescence the crystal field strength, Racah parameters, nephelauxetic effect, and electron-phonon coupling have been analyzed based on spectroscopic results. The electron-phonon coupling parameter S for SWO:Cr was determined to be 11.5, twice as large as that for AWO:Cr, which is in accordance with its strong thermal quenching. The abrupt changes occurring at 275 K in temperature-dependent luminescence spectra and decay lifetime of AWO:Cr is associated with temperature-driven phase transformation from low-temperature monoclinic to high-temperature orthorhombic phase. Pressure induced amorphization of AWO:Cr at pressures higher than 25 kbar was confirmed by employing high pressure evolution of Raman spectra. A high-power NIR pc-LED, fabricated by coating AWO:0.04Cr on a commercial 470 nm LED chip, shows good performance with an output power of 17.1 mW driven by a current of 320 mA, revealing potential application of studied materials for NIR light source.</description>

      <title>UV- and X-ray-activated broadband NIR garnet-type Ca3Ga2Sn3O12:Fe3+ phosphors with efficient persistent luminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (NIR pc-LEDs) are compact light sources of great interest for NIR spectroscopy applications. Beyond typical Cr3+-activated NIR-emitting phosphors, there exists a strong demand for Cr3+-free alternatives with high efficiency and broadband emission to rich the landscape of NIR luminescent materials and extend their range of application fields. Here, we report a series of Fe3+-activated Ca3Ga2Sn3O12 garnet-type phosphors exhibiting broadband NIR emission in the 650-1000 nm range attributed to 4T1(G)--&gt;6A1(S) transition, with a maximum at 754 nm and a FWHM of 89 nm upon UV excitation. The spectroscopic results were analyzed according to the Tanabe-Sugano theory from which the crystal field parameter Dq and Racah parameters B and C were obtained for the octahedrally coordinated Fe3+ ion. Notably, the NIR persistent luminescence lasting over 1 h was detected following UV or X-ray irradiation. The possible mechanism involving electron traps was proposed to explain the observed persistent luminescence. Furthermore, a NIR pc-LED was fabricated by coating synthesized phosphor on a UV chip, and its performance was evaluated to assess its potential suitability as a NIR light source. Our discovery of novel type of nontoxic Fe3+-activated broadband NIR luminescence phosphors with efficient NIR persistent luminescence paves the way for discovering Cr3+-free multifunctional NIR luminescence materials, thereby expanding their application possibilities.</description>

      <title>Linear magnetoelectricity in the Zintl phase pnictides (Ba, Ca, Sr)$\mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{(P, As, Sb)}_2$ from first principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive set of density functional theory calculations on the family of layered antiferromagnetic manganese pnictides (Ba, Ca, Sr)$\mathrm{Mn}_2\mathrm{(P, As, Sb)}_2$. We characterize all components to the linear magnetoelectric (ME) tensor $\alpha$ which are parsed into their contributions from spin and orbital moments for both lattice-mediated and their clamped-ion electronic analogs. Our main results show that the orbital magnetization components cannot be neglected in these systems. The ME response is dominated by electronic effects with total $\alpha$ values exceeding those of the prototypical $\mathrm{Cr}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ (i.e. $\alpha \simeq$ 6.79 ps/m in $\mathrm{BaMn}_2\mathrm{As}_2$). We also identify a strong correlation with the computed ME susceptibility on pnictogen substitution in the trigonal subfamily albeit with weaker amplitudes ($\alpha \simeq$ 0.2-1.7 ps/m). Additionally, we provide the dependence of these predictions on the Hubbard +U correction, at the level of the local density approximation, which show large variations on the calculated ME coefficients in the tetragonal compounds highlighting the role of strong correlation in these compounds.</description>

      <title>Single-layer of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ grown on Ag(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report the growth of a single mixed Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ layer, with diverse stoichiometries, on a Ag(111) substrate. The atomic geometry has been thoroughly investigated by low energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments, as well as calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). We first determined that both pure systems (Bi/Ag(111) and Sb/Ag(111)) show similar behaviors: they form surface alloys with ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$)R30$^\circ$ periodicity for coverages lower than 1/3 ML, and undergo a dealloying transition for higher coverages up to 2/3 ML. We then established a simple preparation procedure to obtain a mixed Bi-Sb overlayer on Ag(111): it is essential to start with a surface completely covered by either of the two pure surface alloys and then deposit the other element on it. The energetics derived from DFT calculations provide insight into the systems preference towards the formation of this phase, and also predict a pathway to the formation of Bi-rich non-alloyed phases. The obtained mixed Bi-Sb phase has a lateral atomic arrangement very similar to the one in the non-alloyed phase observed for Sb on Ag(111), with Sb and Bi atoms distributed disorderly, and presents a significant vertical corrugation, promising considerable Rashba effects.</description>

      <title>Manipulating carbon related spin defects in boron nitride by changing the MOCVD growth temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common solution for precise magnetic field sensing is to employ spin-active defects in semiconductors, with the NV center in diamond as prominent example. However, the three-dimensional nature of diamond limits the obtainable proximity of the defect to the sample. Two-dimensional boron nitride, which can host spin-active defects, can be used to overcome those limitations. In this work, we study spin properties of sp2-bonded boron nitride layers grown using Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition at temperatures ranging from 700 {\deg}C to 1200 {\deg}C. With Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) we show that our layers exhibit spin properties, which we ascribe to carbon related defects. Supported by photoluminescence and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, we distinguish three different regimes: (i) growth at low temperatures with no ESR signal, (ii) growth at intermediate temperatures with a strong ESR signal and a large number of spin defects, (iii) growth at high temperatures with a weaker ESR signal and a lower number of spin defects. The observed effects can be further enhanced by an additional annealing step. Our studies demonstrate wafer-scale boron nitride that intrinsically hosts spin defects without any ion or neutron irradiation, which may be employed in spin memories or magnetic field detectors.</description>

      <title>Exciton-activated effective phonon magnetic moment in monolayer MoS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical excitation of chiral phonons plays a vital role in studying the phonon-driven magnetic phenomena in solids. Transition metal dichalcogenides host chiral phonons at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, providing an ideal platform to explore the interplay between chiral phonons and valley degree of freedom. Here, we investigate the helicity-resolved magneto-Raman response of monolayer MoS2 and identify a doubly degenerate Brillouin-zone-center chiral phonon mode at ~270 cm-1. Our wavelength- and temperature-dependent measurements show that this chiral phonon is activated through the resonant excitation of A exciton. Under an out-of-plane magnetic field, the chiral phonon exhibits giant Zeeman splitting, which corresponds to an effective magnetic moment of 2.5mu_B. Moreover, we carry out theoretical calculations based on the Morphic effects in nonmagnetic crystals, which reproduce the linear Zeeman splitting and Raman cross-section of the chiral phonon. Our study provides important insights into lifting the chiral phonon degeneracy in an achiral covalent material, paving a new route to excite and control chiral phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on a thin film of Si nanocrystals (SiNCs) while applying DC or AC external biases to extract the resistance and the capacitance of the thin film. The measurement consists of the application of 10 V DC or square wave pulses of 10 V amplitude to the sample at various frequencies ranging from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz while recording X-ray photoemission data. To analyze the data, we propose three different models with varying degrees of accuracy. The calculated capacitance of SiNCs agrees with the experimental value in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is generally used for chemical analysis of surfaces and interfaces. This method involves the analysis of changes in binding energies and peak shapes of elements under consideration. It is also possible to use XPS to study the effect of X-ray radiation on the electrical properties of thin films. We measured the Si 2p peak using X-ray powers of 300 W and 150 W on approximately 135 nm silicon dioxide (SiO2) thin films grown on both n- and p-type substrates while applying DC or AC external biases. Using the shifts in the binding energy of the Si 2p peak, we calculated the resistances and the capacitances of the SiO2 thin film. The way that the binding energies of the Si 2p peak and the capacitance of the thin film change as a function of the type of Si substrate and the power of the X-ray are explained using band bending.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in superconductors are of increasing interest due to emergent Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states and Majorana zero modes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, a direct relationship between the YSR multiple states and magnetic anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins remains poorly characterized. By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we resolve systematically individual transition-metal (Fe, Cr and Ni) impurities induced YSR multiplets as well as their Zeeman effects in K$_3$C$_{60}$ superconductor. The YSR multiplets show identical $d$ orbital-like wave functions that are symmetry-mismatched to the threefold K$_3$C$_{60}$(111) host surface, breaking point-group symmetries of the spatial distribution of YSR bound states in real space. Remarkably, we identify an unprecedented fermion-parity-preserving quantum phase transition between ground states with opposite signs of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy that can be manipulated by an external magnetic field. These findings can be readily understood in terms of anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins, and thus elucidate the intricate interplay between the magnetic anisotropy and YSR multiplets.</description>

      <title>Quantum Valley Hall effect without Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) is characterized by the valley Chern number (VCN) in a way that one-dimensional (1D) chiral metallic states are guaranteed to appear at the domain walls (DW) between two domains with opposite VCN for a given valley. Although in the case of QVHE, the total BC of the system is zero, the BC distributed locally around each valley makes the VCN well-defined as long as inter-valley scattering is negligible. Here, we propose a new type of valley-dependent topological phenomenon that occurs when the BC is strictly zero at each momentum. Such zero Berry curvature (ZBC) QVHE is characterized by the valley Euler number (VEN) which is computed by integrating the Euler curvature around a given valley in two-dimensional (2D) systems with space-time inversion symmetry. 1D helical metallic states can be topologically protected at the DW between two domains with the opposite VENs when the DW configuration preserves either the mirror symmetry with respect to the DW or the combination of the DW space-time inversion , and chiral symmetries. We establish the fundamental origin of ZBC-QVHE. Also, by combining tight-binding model study and first-principles calculations, we propose stacked hexagonal bilayer lattices including h-BX (X=As, P) and large-angle twisted bilayer graphenes as candidate systems with robust helical DW states protected by VEN.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we discuss the observation of spin wave interference generated by magnetic oscillators. We employ micromagnetic simulations for two coherent spin Hall nanowire oscillators positioned nearby, horizontally or vertically. The two nanowires produce circular waves with short wavelengths on the order of 100 nm, which interfere with each other. In the horizontal configuration, the spin waves exhibit constructive and destructive fringes, indicating amplification or cancellation of the amplitudes, respectively. The synchronization of spin waves in the current geometry of the two nanowires is facilitated by the combination of dipolar field and propagating spin waves. Additionally, the vertical alignment results in standing spin waves characterized by multiple antinodes and nodes. These observations are interpreted using a wave model that incorporates the superposition principle for each case.</description>

      <title>NbTi: a nontrivial puzzle for the conventional theory of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the first $ab$-$initio$ study of the superconducting state of NbTi, traditionally considered the main workhorse for many large-scale superconducting applications. Despite its apparent simplicity, this compound represents a major challenge for current computational standards in superconductivity. Using the newly developed SSCHA-MLIP framework, we demonstrate that anharmonic effects are required to obtain stable phonon dispersions for the ordered bcc phase, which is unstable at the harmonic level. We also find that treating the residual Coulomb interaction in the newly-developed Kukkonen-Overhauser scheme reduces the $T_c$ by more than 20 $\%$ compared to the simple Morel-Anderson approximation. We show that the unusually large residual discrepancy in $T_c$ with respect to experiment should be attributed to lattice disorder, which we treat with a simple model of Boltzmann-averaged supercells. Our results indicate that a quantitative description of technologically-relevant transition metal alloy superconductors requires methodological developments to account for lattice disorder that go beyond the current standards in computational superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonon Control of Ultrafast Magnetization Dynamics in Fe$_\text{3}$GeTe$_\text{2}$ from Time-Dependent Ab Initio Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring ultrafast magnetization control in two-dimensional (2D) magnets through optically driven coherent phonons has been well-established. Yet, the microscopic interplay between spin dynamics and lattice degrees of freedom remains less explored. Employing real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) coupled with Ehrenfest dynamics, we systematically investigate laser-induced spin-nuclei dynamics with coherent phonon excitation in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. We found that selectively pre-exciting three typical coherent phonon modes results in up to a 53% additional spin moment loss in an out-of-plane A2 1g mode within ~50 fs. Coherent phonon control of spin dynamics is closely linked to laser pulse parameters. The underlying microscopic mechanism of this phenomenon is primarily governed by coherent phonon-induced asymmetric spin-resolved charge transfer following the disappearance of the laser pulse, thereby enabling effective control of the spin moment loss. Our findings offer a novel insight into the coupling of coherent phonons with spin systems in 2D limits on femtosecond timescales.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall Effect: Symmetry Breaking, Twisting, and Giant Disorder Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically-thin materials based on transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene offer a promising avenue for unlocking the mechanisms underlying the spin Hall effect (SHE) in heterointerfaces. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of the SHE for twisted van der Waals heterostructures that fully incorporates twisting and disorder effects, and illustrate the critical role of symmetry breaking in the generation of spin-Hall currents. We find that an accurate treatment of vertex corrections leads to a qualitatively and quantitatively different SHE than that obtained from popular approaches like the ``$i\,\eta$'' and ladder approximations. A pronounced oscillatory behavior of skew-scattering processes with twist angle, $\theta$, is predicted, reflecting a non-trivial interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman effects and yields a vanishing SHE for $\theta = 30^\circ$ and, for graphene-WSe$_2$, an optimal SHE for $\theta \approx 17^\circ$. Our findings reveal disorder and broken symmetries as important knobs to optimize interfacial SHEs.</description>

      <title>Graph neural network coarse-grain force field for the molecular crystal RDX</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condense phase molecular systems organize in wide range of distinct molecular configurations, including amorphous melt and glass as well as crystals often exhibiting polymorphism, that originate from their intricate intra- and intermolecular forces. While accurate coarse-grain (CG) models for these materials are critical to understand phenomena beyond the reach of all-atom simulations, current models cannot capture the diversity of molecular structures. We introduce a generally applicable approach to develop CG force fields for molecular crystals combining graph neural networks (GNN) and data from an all-atom simulations and apply it to the high-energy density material RDX. We address the challenge of expanding the training data with relevant configurations via an iterative procedure that performs CG molecular dynamics of processes of interest and reconstructs the atomistic configurations using a pre-trained neural network decoder. The multi-site CG model uses a GNN architecture constructed to satisfy translational invariance and rotational covariance for forces. The resulting model captures both crystalline and amorphous states for a wide range of temperatures and densities.</description>

      <title>Discovery of superconductivity in technetium-borides at moderate pressures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in theoretical calculations boosted the searches for high temperature superconductors, such as sulfur hydrides and rare-earth polyhydrides. However, the required extremely high pressures for stabilizing these superconductors handicapped further implementations. Based upon thorough structural searches, we identified series of unprecedented superconducting technetium-borides at moderate pressures, including TcB (P6$_3$/mmc) with superconducting transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ = 20.2 K at ambient pressure and TcB$_2$ (P6/mmm) with $T_{\text{c}}$ = 23.1 K at 20 GPa. Superconductivity in these technetium-borides mainly originates from the coupling between the low frequency vibrations of technetium-atoms and the dominant technetium-4d electrons at the Fermi level. Our works therefore present a fresh group in the family of superconducting borides, whose diversified crystal structures suggest rich possibilities in discovery of other superconducting transition-metal-borides.</description>

      <title>Symmetry analysis with spin crystallographic groups: Disentangling effects free of spin-orbit coupling in emergent electromagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies identified spin-order-driven phenomena such as spin-charge interconversion without relying on the relativistic spin-orbit interaction. Those physical properties can be prominent in systems containing light magnetic atoms due to sizable exchange splitting and may pave the way for realization of giant responses correlated with the spin degree of freedom. In this paper, we present a systematic symmetry analysis based on the spin crystallographic groups and identify the physical property of a vast number of magnetic materials up to 1500 in total. By decoupling the spin and orbital degrees of freedom, our analysis enables us to take a closer look into the relation between the dimensionality of spin structures and the resultant physical properties and to identify the spin and orbital contributions separately. In stark contrast to the established analysis with magnetic space groups, the spin crystallographic group manifests richer symmetry including spin-translation symmetry and leads to emergent responses. For representative examples, we discuss the geometrical nature of the anomalous Hall effect and magnetoelectric effect and classify the spin Hall effect arising from the nonrelativistic spin-charge coupling. Using the power of computational analysis, we apply our symmetry analysis to a wide range of magnets, encompassing complex magnets such as those with noncoplanar spin structures as well as collinear and coplanar magnets. We identify emergent multipoles relevant to physical responses and argue that our method provides a systematic tool for exploring sizable electromagnetic responses driven by spin order.</description>

      <title>Interpreting X-ray absorption spectra of Vanadyl Phthalocyanines Spin Qubit Candidates using a Machine Learning-Assisted Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16415v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic dilution of Vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) within the isostructural diamagnetic Titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) affords promising molecular spin qubit platforms for solid-state quantum computing. The development of quantitative methods for determining how the interactions with a supporting substrate impact the electronic structure of the system are fundamental to determine their potential integration in physical devices. In this work we propose a combined approach based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), atomic multiplet calculations, and density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the 3d orbital level structure of VOPc on TiOPc/Ag(100). We characterize VOPc in different molecular environments realized by changing the thickness of TiOPc interlayer and adsorption configuration on Ag(100). Depending on the molecular film structure, we find characteristic XAS features that we analyze using atomic multiplet calculations. We use a Bayesian optimization algorithm to accelerate the parameter search process in the multiplet calculations and identify the ground state properties, such as the 3d orbital occupancy and splitting, as well as intra-atomic interactions. Our analysis indicates that VOPc retains its spin S = 1/2 character in all configurations. Conversely, the energy separation and sequence of the unoccupied V 3d orbitals sensitively depend on the interaction with the surface and TiOPc interlayer. We validate the atomic orbital picture obtained from the multiplet model by comparison with DFT, which further allows us to understand the VOPc electronic properties using a molecular orbital description.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) crystals proved revolutionary soon after graphene was discovered in 2004. However, 2D amorphous materials only became accessible in 2020 and remain largely unexplored. In particular, the thermophysical properties of amorphous materials are of great interest upon transition from 3D to 2D. Here, we probe thermal transport in 2D amorphous carbon. A cross-plane thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) down to 0.079 $\rm{Wm}^{-1}K^{-1}$ is measured for van der Waals stacked multilayers at room temperature, which is among the lowest reported to date. Meanwhile, an unexpectedly high in-plane $\kappa$ is obtained for freestanding monolayers which is a few times larger than what is predicted by conventional wisdom for 3D amorphous carbon with similar $\rm{sp}^{2}$ fraction. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal the role of disorder and highlight the impact of dimensionality. Amorphous materials at the 2D limit open up new avenues for understanding and manipulating heat at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>A first principles study of the Stark shift effect on the zero-phonon line of the NV center in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point defects in semiconductors are attractive candidates for quantum information science applications owing to their ability to act as spin-photon interface or single-photon emitters. However, the coupling between the change of dipole moment upon electronic excitation and stray electric fields in the vicinity of the defect, an effect known as Stark shift, can cause significant spectral diffusion in the emitted photons. In this work, using first principles computations, we revisit the methodology to compute the Stark shift of point defects up to the second order. The approach consists of applying an electric field on a defect in a slab and monitoring the changes in the computed zero-phonon line (i.e., difference in energy between the ground and excited state) obtained from constraining the orbital occupations (constrained-DFT). We study the Stark shift of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond using this slab approach. We discuss and compare two approaches to ensure a negatively charged defect in a slab and we show that converged values of the Stark shift measured by the change in dipole moment between the ground and excited states ($\Delta \mu$) can be obtained. We obtain a Stark shift of $\Delta \mu$=2.68D using the semi-local GGA-PBE functional and of $\Delta \mu$=2.23D using the HSE hybrid-functional. The results of the slab computations are significantly different than those obtained with Modern Theory of Polarization ($\Delta \mu$=4.34D for GGA-PBE) indicating a potential issue with the combination of constrained-DFT and Modern Theory of Polarization, at least in certain codes.</description>

      <title>Tuning of the ultrafast demagnetization by ultrashort spin polarized currents in multi-sublattice ferrimagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser pulses can be used to induce ultrafast changes of the magnetization in magnetic materials. Several microscopic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observations, including the transport of ultrashort spin-polarized hot-electrons (SPHE). Such ultrafast spin currents find growing interest because of the recent challenges in ultrafast spintronics however they are only poorly characterized. One of the key challenges is to characterize the spin-polarized ultrafast currents and the microscopic mechanisms behind SPHE induced manipulation of the magnetization, especially in the case of technologically relevant ferrimagnetic alloys. Here, we have used a combined approach using time- and element-resolved X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and theoretical calculations based on atomistic spin-dynamics simulations to address the ultrafast transfer of the angular momentum from spin-polarized currents into ferrimagnetic Fe74Gd26 films and the concomitant reduction of sub-lattice magnetization. Our study shows that using a Co/Pt multilayer as a polarizer in a spin-valve structure, the SPHE drives the demagnetization of the two sub-lattices of the Fe74Gd26 film. This behaviour is explained based on two physical mechanisms, i.e., spin transfer torque and thermal fluctuations induced by the SPHE. We provide a quantitative description of the heat transfer of the ultrashort SPHE pulse to the Fe74Gd26 films, as well as the degree of spin-polarization of the SPHE current density responsible for the observed magnetization dynamics. Our work finally characterizes the spin-polarization of the SPHEs revealing unexpected opposite spin polarization to the Co magnetization, explaining our experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern detector technology and highly brilliant fourth-generation synchrotrons allow to improve the temporal resolution in time-resolved diffraction studies. Profiting from this, we applied temperature scanning X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to probe the dynamics of a Pt-based metallic glass former in the glass, glass transition region, and supercooled liquid, covering up to six orders of magnitude in time scales. Our data demonstrates that the structural alpha-relaxation process is still observable in the glass, although it is partially masked by a faster source of decorrelation observed at atomic scale. We present an approach that interprets these findings as the superposition of heterogeneous liquid-like and stress-driven ballistic-like atomic motions. This work not only extends the dynamical range probed by standard isothermal XPCS, but also clarifies the fate of the alpha-relaxation across the glass transition and provides a new perception on the anomalous, compressed temporal decay of the density-density correlation functions observed in metallic glasses and many out-of-equilibrium soft materials.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Optical Signatures of Polymeric Carbon Nitrides: Insights into Stacking-Induced Excitonic Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted considerable attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and significant potential in energy-related applications. Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) with 2D stacked architecture show promise as photocatalysts for solar-to-fuel conversion and as versatile 2D semiconductors. However, the lack of a clear definition of the exact structural model of these materials limits our fundamental understanding of their unique properties. Here, we investigate the structure-induced optical properties of PCNs through \textit{ab initio} calculations. Our study on the electronic and optical properties of PCNs highlights the significant influence of structure on their behavior, especially near band edges. The analysis reveals that the degree of condensation and corrugation influences the electron/hole localization and the energy levels of $\pi$ electrons, which are crucial for the optical behavior. In addition, the microstructures of 2D configurations lead to divergent optical properties in 3D configurations, with characteristic peaks identified at 350 nm and interlayer interactions ranging from 400 to 500 nm, depending on the specific microstructures. Through observations over 2D and 3D structures, we elucidate exciton photophysical processes in PCN materials. This highlights the substantial differences in optical properties between actual 2D and 3D structures, while also demonstrating the potential for carrier and energy transport mechanisms to occur perpendicular to the plane. Finally, our results provide deep insights into the understanding of previously hidden microstructural, electronic, and optical properties of PCNs, paving the way for further performance and property enhancements in this class of materials.</description>

      <title>Electrically controlled photonic circuits of field-induced dipolaritons with huge nonlinearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrically controlled photonic circuits hold promise for information technologies with greatly improved energy efficiency and quantum information processing capabilities. However, weak nonlinearity and electrical response of typical photonic materials have been two critical challenges. Therefore hybrid electronic-photonic systems, such as semiconductor exciton-polaritons, have been intensely investigated for their potential to allow higher nonlinearity and electrical control, with limited success so far. Here we demonstrate an electrically-gated waveguide architecture for dipolar-polaritons that allows enhanced and electrically-controllable polariton nonlinearities, enabling an electrically-tuned reflecting switch (mirror) and transistor of the dipolar-polaritons. The polariton transistor displays blockade and anti-blockade by compressing a dilute dipolar-polariton pulse exhibiting very strong dipolar interactions. The large nonlinearities are well explained using a simple density-dependent polarization field that very effectively screens the external electric field. Remarkably, we show that induced dipoles have an order of magnitude enhancement of the nonlinearities as compared to fixed dipoles. We project that a quantum blockade at the single polariton level is feasible in such a device.</description>

      <title>Single-hole spectra of Kitaev spin liquids: from dynamical Nagaoka ferromagnetism to spin-hole fractionalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical response of a quantum spin liquid upon injecting a hole is a pertinent open question. In experiments, the hole spectral function, measured momentum-resolved in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or locally in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), can be used to identify spin liquid materials. In this study, we employ tensor network methods to simulate the time evolution of a single hole doped into the Kitaev spin-liquid ground state. Focusing on the gapped spin liquid phase, we reveal two fundamentally different scenarios. For ferromagnetic spin couplings, the spin liquid is highly susceptible to hole doping: a Nagaoka ferromagnet forms dynamically around the doped hole, even at weak coupling. By contrast, in the case of antiferromagnetic spin couplings, the hole spectrum demonstrates an intricate interplay between charge, spin, and flux degrees of freedom, best described by a parton mean-field ansatz of fractionalized holons and spinons. Moreover, we find a good agreement of our numerical results to the analytically solvable case of slow holes. Our results demonstrate that dynamical hole spectral functions provide rich information on the structure of fractionalized quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry breaking and topological charge of graphene nanoribbons</title>

Abstract: We explore the edge properties of rectangular graphene nanoribbons featuring two zigzag edges and two armchair edges. Although the self-consistent Hartree-Fock fields break chiral symmetry, our work demonstrates that graphene nanoribbons maintain their status as short-range entangled symmetry-protected topological insulators. The relevant symmetry involves combined mirror and time-reversal operations. In undoped ribbons displaying edge ferromagnetism, the band gap edge states with a topological charge form on the zigzag edges. An analysis of the anomalous continuity equation elucidates that this topological charge is induced by the gap term. In low-doped zigzag ribbons, where the ground state exhibits edge spin density waves, this topological charge appears as a nearly zero-energy edge mode. Our system is outside the conventional calssification for topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbital Ordering in Alkali Superoxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Akali superoxides AO2 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs), due to an open p shell of the oxygen ion O2^- with degenerate pi orbitals, have spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The complex magnetic, orbital, and structural phase transitions observed experimentally in this family of materials are only partially understood. Based on density functional theory, we derive a strong-coupling effective model for the isostructural compounds AO2 (A=K, Rb, Cs) from a two-orbital Hubbard model. We find that CsO2 has highly frustrated exchange interactions in the a-b plane, while the frustration is weaker for smaller alkali ions. We solve the resulting Kugel-Khomskii model in the mean-field approximation. We show that CsO2 exhibits an antiferro-orbital (AFO) order with the ordering vector q=(1,0,0) and a stripe antiferromagnetic order with q=(1/2,0,0), which is consistent with recent neutron scattering experiments. We discuss the role of the pi-orbital degrees of freedom for the experimentally observed magnetic transitions and interpret the as-yet-unidentified T_s2=70K transition in CsO2 as an orbital ordering transition.</description>
