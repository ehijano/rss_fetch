      <title>Stochastic block models with many communities and the Kesten--Stigum bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inference of communities in stochastic block models with a growing number of communities. For block models with $n$ vertices and a fixed number of communities $q$, it was predicted in Decelle et al. (2011) that there are computationally efficient algorithms for recovering the communities above the Kesten--Stigum (KS) bound and that efficient recovery is impossible below the KS bound. This conjecture has since stimulated a lot of interest, with the achievability side proven in a line of research that culminated in the work of Abbe and Sandon (2018). Conversely, recent work by Sohn and Wein (2025) provides evidence for the hardness part using the low-degree paradigm.
  In this paper we investigate community recovery in the regime $q=q_n \to \infty$ as $n\to\infty$ where no such predictions exist. We show that efficient inference of communities remains possible above the KS bound. Furthermore, we show that recovery of block models is low-degree hard below the KS bound when the number of communities satisfies $q\ll \sqrt{n}$. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that when $q \gg \sqrt{n}$, there is an efficient algorithm based on non-backtracking walks for recovery even below the KS bound. We identify a new threshold and ask if it is the threshold for efficient recovery in this regime. Finally, we show that detection is easy and identify (up to a constant) the information-theoretic threshold for community recovery as the number of communities $q$ diverges.
  Our low-degree hardness results also naturally have consequences for graphon estimation, improving results of Luo and Gao (2024).</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of gauge covariant renormalisation of stochastic 3D Yang-Mills-Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local solutions to the 3D stochastic quantisation equations of Yang-Mills-Higgs were constructed in (arXiv:2201.03487), and it was shown that, in the limit of smooth mollifications, there exists a mass renormalisation of the Yang-Mills field such that the solution is gauge covariant. In this paper we prove uniqueness of the mass renormalisation that leads to gauge covariant solutions. This strengthens the main result of (arXiv:2201.03487), and is potentially important for the identification of the limit of other approximations, such as lattice dynamics. Our proof relies on systematic short-time expansions of singular stochastic PDEs and of regularised Wilson loops. We also strengthen the recently introduced state spaces to allow finer control on line integrals appearing in expansions of Wilson loops.</description>

      <title>Loop vs. Bernoulli percolation on trees: strict inequality of critical values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider loop ensembles on random trees. The loops are induced by a Poisson process of links sampled on the underlying tree interpreted as a metric graph. We allow two types of links, crosses and double bars. The crosses-only case corresponds to the random-interchange process, the inclusion of double bars is motivated by representations of models arising in mathematical physics. For a large class of random trees, including all Galton-Watson trees with mean offspring number in $(1,\infty)$, we show that the threshold Poisson intensity at which an infinite loop arises is strictly larger than the corresponding quantity for percolation of the untyped links. The latter model is equivalent to i.i.d. Bernoulli bond percolation. An important ingredient in our argument is a sensitivity result for the bond percolation threshold under downward perturbation of the underlying tree by a general finite range percolation. We also provide a partial converse to the strict-inequality result in the case of Galton-Watson trees and improve previously established criteria for the existence of an infinite loop in the case were the Galton-Watson tree has Poisson offspring.</description>

      <title>On the strong law of large numbers and Llog L condition for supercritical general branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider branching processes for structured populations: each individual is characterized by a type or trait which belongs to a general measurable state space. We focus on the supercritical recurrent case, where the population may survive and grow and the trait distribution  converges. The branching process is then expected to be driven by the positive triplet of first eigenvalue problem of the first moment semigroup. Under the assumption of convergence of the renormalized semigroup in weighted total variation norm, we prove strong convergence of the normalized empirical measure and non-degeneracy of the limiting martingale. Convergence is obtained under an Llog L  condition which provides a  Kesten-Stigum result in infinite dimension and relaxes the uniform convergence assumption of the renormalized first moment semigroup required in the work of Asmussen and Hering in 1976. The techniques of proofs combine families of martingales and contraction  of semigroups and  the truncation procedure of Asmussen and Hering. We also obtain L^1 convergence of the renormalized empirical measure and contribute to unifying different results in the literature. These results greatly extend the class of examples where a law of large numbers applies, as we illustrate it with absorbed branching diffusion, the house of cards model and some growth-fragmentation processes.</description>

      <title>Persistence probabilities of spherical fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the rate of decay of the persistence probabilities of spherical fractional Brownian motion, which was defined by L\'evy (1965) and Istas (2005). The rate resembles the Euclidean case treated in Molchan (1999).
  As a by-product we consider the coefficients of series representations of functions with algebraic endpoint singularities in terms of re-scaled Gegenbauer polynomials, which partly generalises Sidi (2009).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the gradient flow structure and the well-posedness of the Fokker-Planck equation on locally finite graphs. We first construct a 2-Wasserstein-type metric in the probability density space associated with the underlying graphs that are locally finite. Then, we prove the global existence and asymptotic behavior of the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation using a novel approach that differs significantly from the methods applied in the finite case, as proposed in [S., Chow, W., Huang, Y., Li, H., Zhou, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 2012]. This work seems the first result on the study of Wasserstein-type metrics and the Fokker-Planck equation in probability spaces defined on infinite graphs.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Insights for Efficient Exploration Strategies in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate efficient exploration strategies of environments with unknown stochastic dynamics and sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze first the impact of parallel simulations on the probability of reaching rare states within a finite time budget. Using simplified models based on random walks and L\'evy processes, we provide analytical results that demonstrate a phase transition in reaching probabilities as a function of the number of parallel simulations. We identify an optimal number of parallel simulations that balances exploration diversity and time allocation. Additionally, we analyze a restarting mechanism that exponentially enhances the probability of success by redirecting efforts toward more promising regions of the state space. Our findings contribute to a more qualitative and quantitative theory of some exploration schemes in reinforcement learning, offering insights into developing more efficient strategies for environments characterized by rare events.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviors of subcritical branching killed spectrally negative L\'{e}vy process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behaviors of the survival probability and maximal displacement of a subcritical branching killed spectrally negative L\'{e}vy process $X$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Let $\zeta$ denote the extinction time, $M_t$ be the maximal position of all the particles alive at time $t$, and $M:=\sup_{t\ge 0}M_t$ be the all-time maximum. Under the assumption that the offspring distribution satisfies the $L\log L$ condition and some conditions on the spatial motion, we find the decay rate of the survival probability $\mathbb{P}_x(\zeta&gt;t)$ and the tail behavior of $M_t$ as $t\to\infty$. As a consequence, we establish a Yaglom-type theorem. We also find the asymptotic behavior of $\mathbb{P}_x(M&gt;y)$ as $y\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>A mild rough Gronwall Lemma with applications to non-autonomous evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a Gronwall type inequality for mild solutions of non-autonomous parabolic rough partial differential equations (RPDEs). This inequality together with an analysis of the Cameron-Martin space associated to the noise, allows us to obtain the existence of moments of all order for the solution of the corresponding RPDE and its Jacobian when the random input is given by a Gaussian Volterra process. Applying further the multiplicative ergodic theorem, these integrable bounds entail the existence of Lyapunov exponents for RPDEs. We illustrate these results for stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative boundary noise.</description>

      <title>Expected number of jumps and the number of active particles in TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03636v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a TASEP on $\mathbb Z$ with the step initial condition we identify limits as $t\to\infty$ of the expected total number of jumps until time $t&gt;0$ and the expected number of active particles at a time $t$. We also connect the two quantities proving that non-asymptotically, that is as a function of $t&gt;0$, the latter is the derivative of the former. Our approach builds on asymptotics derived by Rost and intensive use of the fact that the rightmost particle evolves according to the Poisson process.</description>

      <title>Vector-Valued Stochastic Integration With Respect to Semimartingales in the Dual of Nuclear Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a theory of stochastic integration for operator-valued processes with respect to semimartingales taking values in the dual of a nuclear space. These semimartingales are required to have the good integrator property, which is a property that we explore in detail and provide several examples. Our construction of the stochastic integral uses a regularization argument for cylindrical semimartingales and the theory of real-valued stochastic integration introduced by the author in a previous work [Electron. J. Probab., Volume 26, paper no. 147, 2021]. We show various properties of the stochastic integral; in particular we study continuity of the integral mapping for integrands and for integrators, we prove a Riemman representation formula, and we introduce sufficient conditions for the stochastic integral to be a good integrator. Finally, we apply our theory to show an extension of \"{U}st\"{u}nel's version of It\^{o}'s formula in the spaces of distributions and of tempered distributions.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions for singular SDEs driven by long-range dependent fractional Brownian motion and other Volterra processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion, focusing on the long-range dependent case $H \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$. While existing results on regularization by such noise typically require H\"older continuity of the drift, we establish new strong existence and uniqueness results for certain classes of singular drifts, including discontinuous and highly irregular functions. More generally, we treat stochastic differential equations with additive noise given by a broader class of Volterra processes satisfying suitable kernel conditions, which, in addition to fractional Brownian motion, also includes the Riemann-Liouville process as a special case. Our approach relies on probabilistic arguments.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-type density estimates for mixed SDEs driven by correlated fractional Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence and properties of Gaussian-like densities for weak solutions of multidimensional stochastic differential equations driven by a mixture of completely correlated fractional Brownian motions. We consider both the short-range and long-range dependent regimes, imposing a singular drift in the short-range dependent case and a H\"older continuous drift in the long-range dependent setting. Our approach avoids the use of Malliavin calculus and stochastic dynamical systems, relying instead on the Girsanov theorem and the framework of exponential Orlicz spaces. By considering a conditionally Gaussian process, we establish the existence of a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Furthermore, we derive Gaussian-type upper and lower bounds for this density, illustrating the optimality of our results in the short-range dependent case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Join-the-Shortest-Queue-d routing policy is considered for a large system with $n$ servers. Moderate deviation principles (MDP) for the occupancy process and the empirical queue length process are established as $n\to \infty$. Each MDP is formulated in terms of a large deviation principle with an appropriate speed function in a suitable infinite-dimensional path space. Proofs rely on certain variational representations for exponential functionals of Poisson random measures. As a case study, the convergence of rate functions for systems with finite buffer size $K$ to the rate function without buffer is analyzed, as $K \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Function-Coherent Gambles with Non-Additive Sequential Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a rigorous foundation for imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility via its coherence axioms. In our related work, we introduced function-coherent gambles to accommodate non-linear utility. However, when repeated gambles are played over time -- especially in intertemporal choice where rewards compound multiplicatively -- the standard additive combination axiom fails to capture the appropriate long-run evaluation. In this paper we extend the framework by relaxing the additive combination axiom and introducing a nonlinear combination operator that effectively aggregates repeated gambles in the log-domain. This operator preserves the time-average (geometric) growth rate and addresses the ergodicity problem. We prove the key algebraic properties of the operator, discuss its impact on coherence, risk assessment, and representation, and provide a series of illustrative examples. Our approach bridges the gap between expectation values and time averages and unifies normative theory with empirically observed non-stationary reward dynamics.</description>

      <title>Applications of Entropy in Data Analysis and Machine Learning: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its origin in the thermodynamics of the 19th century, the concept of entropy has also permeated other fields of physics and mathematics, such as Classical and Quantum Statistical Mechanics, Information Theory, Probability Theory, Ergodic Theory and the Theory of Dynamical Systems. Specifically, we are referring to the classical entropies: the Boltzmann-Gibbs, von Neumann, Shannon, Kolmogorov-Sinai and topological entropies. In addition to their common name, which is historically justified (as we briefly describe in this review), other commonality of the classical entropies is the important role that they have played and are still playing in the theory and applications of their respective fields and beyond. Therefore, it is not surprising that, in the course of time, many other instances of the overarching concept of entropy have been proposed, most of them tailored to specific purposes. Following the current usage, we will refer to all of them, whether classical or new, simply as entropies. Precisely, the subject of this review is their applications in data analysis and machine learning. The reason for these particular applications is that entropies are very well suited to characterize probability mass distributions, typically generated by finite-state processes or symbolized signals. Therefore, we will focus on entropies defined as positive functionals on probability mass distributions and provide an axiomatic characterization that goes back to Shannon and Khinchin. Given the plethora of entropies in the literature, we have selected a representative group, including the classical ones. The applications summarized in this review finely illustrate the power and versatility of entropy in data analysis and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Heavy-traffic Optimality of Skip-the-Longest-Queues in Heterogeneous Parallel Service Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time parallel service system consisting of $n$ heterogeneous single server queues with infinite capacity. Jobs arrive to the system as an i.i.d. process with rate proportional to $n$, and must be immediately dispatched in the time slot that they arrive. The dispatcher is assumed to be able to exchange messages with the servers to obtain their queue lengths and make dispatching decisions, introducing an undesirable communication overhead.
  In this setting, we propose a ultra-low communication overhead load balancing policy dubbed $k$-Skip-the-$d$-Longest-Queues ($k$-SLQ-$d$), where queue lengths are only observed every $k(n-d)$ time slots and, between observations, incoming jobs are sent to a queue that is not one of the $d$ longest ones at the time that the queues were last observed. For this policy, we establish conditions on $d$ for it to be throughput optimal and we show that, under that condition, it is asymptotically delay-optimal in heavy-traffic for arbitrarily low communication overheads (i.e., for arbitrarily large $k$).</description>

      <title>Can Diffusion Models Provide Rigorous Uncertainty Quantification for Bayesian Inverse Problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the ascendance of diffusion modeling as a state-of-the-art generative modeling approach has spurred significant interest in their use as priors in Bayesian inverse problems. However, it is unclear how to optimally integrate a diffusion model trained on the prior distribution with a given likelihood function to obtain posterior samples. While algorithms that have been developed for this purpose can produce high-quality, diverse point estimates of the unknown parameters of interest, they are often tested on problems where the prior distribution is analytically unknown, making it difficult to assess their performance in providing rigorous uncertainty quantification. In this work, we introduce a new framework, Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers through Diffusion Annealing (BIPSDA), for diffusion model based posterior sampling. The framework unifies several recently proposed diffusion model based posterior sampling algorithms and contains novel algorithms that can be realized through flexible combinations of design choices. Algorithms within our framework were tested on model problems with a Gaussian mixture prior and likelihood functions inspired by problems in image inpainting, x-ray tomography, and phase retrieval. In this setting, approximate ground-truth posterior samples can be obtained, enabling principled evaluation of the performance of the algorithms. The results demonstrate that BIPSDA algorithms can provide strong performance on the image inpainting and x-ray tomography based problems, while the challenging phase retrieval problem, which is difficult to sample from even when the posterior density is known, remains outside the reach of the diffusion model based samplers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the notion of a (mild) $C$-existence family in complete random normed modules, then we prove that a (mild) $C$-existence family can guarantee the existence of the (mild) solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem in the random setting. Second, we investigate several important properties peculiar to locally almost surely bounded $C$-semigroups in complete random normed modules, which are not involved in the classical theory of $C$-semigroups. Finally, based on the above work, some relations among $C$-existence families, $C$-semigroups and their associated abstract Cauchy problems in complete random normed modules are established, which extend and improve some known results. Besides, an application to a type of stochastic differential equations is also given.</description>

      <title>Active operator learning with predictive uncertainty quantification for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a method for uncertainty quantification in deep operator networks (DeepONets) using predictive uncertainty estimates calibrated to model errors observed during training. The uncertainty framework operates using a single network, in contrast to existing ensemble approaches, and introduces minimal overhead during training and inference. We also introduce an optimized implementation for DeepONet inference (reducing evaluation times by a factor of five) to provide models well-suited for real-time applications. We evaluate the uncertainty-equipped models on a series of partial differential equation (PDE) problems, and show that the model predictions are unbiased, non-skewed, and accurately reproduce solutions to the PDEs. To assess how well the models generalize, we evaluate the network predictions and uncertainty estimates on in-distribution and out-of-distribution test datasets. We find the predictive uncertainties accurately reflect the observed model errors over a range of problems with varying complexity; simpler out-of-distribution examples are assigned low uncertainty estimates, consistent with the observed errors, while more complex out-of-distribution examples are properly assigned higher uncertainties. We also provide a statistical analysis of the predictive uncertainties and verify that these estimates are well-aligned with the observed error distributions at the tail-end of training. Finally, we demonstrate how predictive uncertainties can be used within an active learning framework to yield improvements in accuracy and data-efficiency for outer-loop optimization procedures.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Game of Controls with State Reflections: Existence and Limit Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies mean field game (MFG) of controls by featuring the joint distribution of the state and the control with the reflected state process along an exogenous stochastic reflection boundary. We contribute to the literature with a customized relaxed formulation and some new compactification arguments to establish the existence of a Markovian mean field equilibrium (MFE) in the weak sense. We consider an enlarged canonical space, utilizing the dynamic Skorokhod mapping, to accommodate the stochastic reflection boundary process. A fixed-point argument on the extended space using an extension transformation technique is developed to tackle challenges from the joint measure flow of the state and the relaxed control that may not be continuous. Furthermore, the bidirectional connections between the MFG and the $N$-player game are also established in the context of joint law dependence and state reflections. We first show that any weak limit of empirical measures induced by $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-Nash equilibria in $N$-player games must be supported exclusively on the set of relaxed mean field equilibria, analogous to the propagation of chaos in mean field control problems. We then prove the convergence result that a Markovian MFE in the weak sense can be approximated by a sequence of constructed $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-Nash equilibria in the weak sense in $N$-player games when $N$ tends to infinity.</description>

Abstract: We study the linear-quadratic control problem for a class of non-exchangeable mean-field systems,  which model large populations of heterogeneous interacting agents.  We explicitly characterize the optimal control in terms of a new infinite-dimensional system of Riccati equations, for which we establish existence and uniqueness. To illustrate our results, we apply this framework to a systemic risk model involving heterogeneous banks, demonstrating the impact of agent heterogeneity on optimal risk mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>B\^ocher type theorem for elliptic equations with drift perturbed L\'evy operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical B\^ocher's theorem asserts that any positive harmonic function (with respect to the Laplacian) in the punctured unit ball can be expressed, up to the multiplication constant, as the sum of the Newtonian kernel and a positive function that is harmonic in the whole unit ball. This theorem expresses one of the fundamental results in the theory of isolated singularities and it can be viewed as a statement on the asymptotic behavior of positive harmonic functions near their isolated singularities. In the paper we generalize this results to drift perturbed L\'evy operators. We propose a new approach based on the probabilistic potential theory. It applies to L\'evy operators for which the resolvent of its perturbation is strongly Feller. In particular our result encompasses drift perturbed fractional Laplacians with any stability index bounded between zero and two - the method therefore applies to subcritical and supercritical cases.</description>

Abstract: We use tools from random matrix theory to study the multi-spiked tensor model, i.e., a rank-$r$ deformation of a symmetric random Gaussian tensor. In particular, thanks to the nature of local optimization methods used to find the maximum likelihood estimator of this model, we propose to study the phase transition phenomenon for finding critical points of the corresponding optimization problem, i.e., those points defined by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Moreover, we characterize the limiting alignments between the estimated signals corresponding to a critical point of the likelihood and the ground truth signals. With the help of these results, we propose a new estimator of the rank-$r$ tensor weights by solving a system of polynomial equations, which is asymptotically unbiased contrary the maximum likelihood estimator.</description>

Abstract: For continuous mixtures of random variables, we provide a simple criterion -- generating-function accessibility -- to extend previously known kernel-based identifiability (or unidentifiability) results to new kernel distributions. This criterion, based on functional relationships between the relevant kernels' moment-generating functions or Laplace transforms, may be applied to continuous mixtures of both discrete and continuous random variables. To illustrate the proposed approach, we present results for several specific kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13183v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that a Lorenz curve, derived from the distribution function of a random variable, can itself be viewed as a probability distribution function of a new random variable [4]. We prove the surprising result that a sequence of consecutive iterations of this map leads to a non-corner case convergence, independent of the initial random variable. In the primal case, both the limiting distribution and its parent follow a power-law distribution with exponent equal to the golden section. In the reflected case, the limiting distribution is the Kumaraswamy distribution with a conjugate value of the exponent, while the parent distribution is the classical Pareto distribution. Potential applications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Metastability and time scales for parabolic equations with drift 2: the general time scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&amp;\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &amp;u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t&gt;0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales
  $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our proof relies on the full tree-structure characterization of the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.</description>

      <title>A simple proof of almost sure convergence for the largest singular value of a product of Gaussian matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $m \geq 1$ and consider the product of $m$ independent $n \times n$ matrices $\mathbf{W} = \mathbf{W}_1 \dots \mathbf{W}_m$, each $\mathbf{W}_{i}$ with i.i.d. normalised $\mathcal{N}(0, n^{-1/2})$ entries. It is shown in Penson et al. (2011) that the empirical distribution of the squared singular values of $\mathbf{W}$ converges to a deterministic distribution compactly supported on $[0, u_m]$, where $u_m = \frac{{(m+1)}^{m+1}}{m^m}$. This generalises the well-known case of $m=1$, corresponding to the Marchenko-Pastur distribution for square matrices. Moreover, for $m=1$, it was first shown by Geman (1980) that the largest squared singular value almost surely converges to the right endpoint (the so-called ``soft edge'') of the support, i.e. $s_1^2(\mathbf{W}) \xrightarrow{a.s.} u_1$. Herein, we present a proof for the general case $s_1^2(\mathbf{W}) \xrightarrow{a.s.} u_m$ for $m\geq 1$. Although we do not claim novelty for our result, the proof is simple and does not require familiarity with modern techniques of free probability.</description>

      <title>Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local-unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of independent unitary matrices. We consider both the mixed case of a tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, which includes the random tensor models extensively studied in the physics literature.
  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined using correlations of certain invariant polynomials encoded by $D$-tuples of permutations, up to relabeling equivalence. Finite size free cumulants associated to the expectations of these invariants are defined through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.
  Two important cases are considered asymptotically: pure random tensors that scale like a complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants associated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas involving summations over non-crossing permutations. The pure and mixed cases involve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the distribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a sum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of higher orders is provided.
  Tensor freeness is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order tensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic moments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic construction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative probability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of these spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor freeness of the subspaces they generate.</description>

      <title>Fast exact recovery of noisy matrix from few entries: the infinity norm approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The matrix recovery (completion) problem, a central problem in data science and theoretical computer science, is to recover a matrix $A$ from a relatively small sample of entries.
  While such a task is impossible in general, it has been shown that one can recover $A$ exactly in polynomial time, with high probability, from a random subset of entries, under three (basic and necessary) assumptions: (1) the rank of $A$ is very small compared to its dimensions (low rank), (2) $A$ has delocalized singular vectors (incoherence), and (3) the sample size is sufficiently large.
  There are many different algorithms for the task, including convex optimization by Candes, Tao and Recht (2009), alternating projection by Hardt and Wooters (2014) and low rank approximation with gradient descent by Keshavan, Montanari and Oh (2009, 2010).
  In applications, it is more realistic to assume that data is noisy. In this case, these approaches provide an approximate recovery with small root mean square error. However, it is hard to transform such an approximate recovery to an exact one.
  Recently, results by Abbe et al. (2017) and Bhardwaj et al. (2023) concerning approximation in the infinity norm showed that we can achieve exact recovery even in the noisy case, given that the ground matrix has bounded precision. Beyond the three basic assumptions above, they required either the condition number of $A$ is small (Abbe et al.) or the gap between consecutive singular values is large (Bhardwaj et al.).
  In this paper, we remove these extra spectral assumptions. As a result, we obtain a simple algorithm for exact recovery in the noisy case, under only the three basic assumptions. This is the first such algorithm. To analyse this algorithm, we introduce a contour integration argument which is totally different from all previous methods and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Conjunctions of Three "Euler Constants" in Poisson-Related Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three mathematical constants bear the name of the venerable Leonhard Euler: Euler's number, $e=2.718281\ldots$; the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577216\ldots$; and the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347\ldots$. In the present work, we consider two joint appearances of these constants, one in a well-known equation of Hardy (interpretable in connection with inverse second moments of the Poisson probability distribution), and the other from a sequence of probabilities generated by recursively conditional Exponential (i.e., Poisson-event waiting-time) distributions. In both cases, we explore extensions of the initial observations to offer more comprehensive results.</description>
