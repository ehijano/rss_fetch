      <title>Odderon in the light of collider low-$t$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odderon is the $C$-odd amplitude that does not fall (or decrease very slowly) with energy. The expected amplitude is small and mainly real. Therefore, extracting it from the data on top of a much larger $C$-even contribution is challenging. The only chance is to consider the very low $|t|$ region of Coulomb nuclear interference or the diffractive dip region. Here we perform the analysis of elastic scattering $pp$ and $\bar pp$ data at low momentum transfer $|t| &lt; 0.1$ GeV$^2$ within large collider energy interval $\sqrt s = 50$ GeV $-$ 13 TeV in order to evaluate quantitatively the possible Odderon contribution. We use the two-channel eikonal model, which naturally accounts for the screening of the Odderon amplitude by the $C$-even (Pomeron) exchanges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy behavior of the elastic scattering amplitude using the eikonal and $U$-matrix unitarization schemes. This work extends the analysis in [1] by exploring the sensitivity of the Pomeron and Odderon parameters to the inclusion of differential cross-section data over an extended range of $|t|$.</description>

      <title>Simple Scaling Laws for Energy Correlators in Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collider experiments involving nuclei provide a direct means of studying exotic states of nuclear matter. Recent measurements of energy correlators in both proton-nucleus (p-A) and nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions reveal sizable modifications, attributable to nuclear effects, compared to proton-proton (p-p) collisions. Energy correlators, and their associated light-ray operator product expansion (OPE), allow scaling behaviors of the measured spectrum to be directly mapped to properties of the underlying quantum field theory. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how this mapping occurs in nuclear collisions, and highlight how the light-ray OPE characterizes leading nuclear effects. We show that the leading modification to the energy correlator distribution is characterized by an enhancement of the expectation value of twist-4 light-ray operators, resulting in a scaling for the ratio of the two-point correlator in nuclear matter to that in vacuum of $\sim 1+a\theta^2$ up to quantum corrections. We verify that this leading twist-4 correction accurately describes recent A-A and p-A data, and is thus sufficient to capture the scaling behavior within the angular range measured for jet radii used in nuclear experiments. Our light-ray OPE based approach lays the groundwork for a rigorous characterization of nuclear modification to energy correlator observables.</description>

      <title>Probing Lepton Number Violation at Same-Sign Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Same-sign lepton colliders offer a promising environment to probe lepton number violation. We study processes that change lepton number by two units in the context of Majorana heavy neutral leptons and neutrinophilic scalars at $\mu$TRISTAN, a proposed same-sign muon collider. Our work shows that such colliders, with modest energy and luminosity requirements, can either reveal direct evidence of lepton number violation or significantly constrain unexplored regions of parameter space, especially in the case of a neutrinophilic scalar.</description>

      <title>The Seiberg-Witten Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully calculable UV complete toy model of a Peccei-Quinn (PQ) axion coupled to magnetic monopoles as well as electric charges. The theory has manifest electric-magnetic duality built in. We find that the axion-photon coupling contains the usual anomaly term, plus periodic corrections which can also become large if the monopole is light, without violating the discrete axion shift symmetry. These additional periodic terms can be identified as the non-perturbative corrections due to the monopoles (and other BPS states), but can also be interpreted as a sum over instanton corrections. The key aspect helping reconcile axion coupling quantization with electric-magnetic duality is the fact that the axion itself undergoes a non-linear transformation under electric-magnetic duality. The theory analyzed here is just the original $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$ Seiberg-Witten theory, which contains a PQ axion due to an anomalous spontaneously broken global $R$-symmetry, as well as massless fermionic monopoles and dyons at special points in the moduli space. Hence the entire machinery of the Seiberg-Witten solution can be applied to reliably calculate the photon-axion coupling in different duality frames. We show explicitly that the physically observable axion-photon amplitude is duality invariant, as it had to be.</description>

      <title>Precise predictions for $t \bar t H$ production at the LHC: inclusive cross section and differential distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD calculation for the production of a top-antitop quark pair in association with a Higgs boson ($t \bar t H$) at hadron colliders. The computation is exact, except for the finite part of the two-loop virtual contribution, which we estimate using two different methods that yield consistent results within their respective uncertainties. The first method relies on a soft-Higgs factorisation formula that we develop up to the three-loop order. The second is based on a high-energy expansion in the small top-mass limit. Combining the newly computed corrections with the complete set of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD+EW results provides the most advanced perturbative prediction currently available at the LHC for both inclusive and differential $t \bar t H$ cross sections. The uncertainties due to the missing exact two-loop contribution are conservatively estimated to be below the percent level, both for the total cross section and for most of the differential distributions, and therefore significantly smaller than the residual perturbative uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Kaon Distribution Functions from Empirical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using available information from Drell-Yan data on pion and kaon structure functions, an approach is described which enables the development of pointwise profiles for all pion and kaon parton distribution functions (DFs) without reference to theories of hadron structure. The key steps are construction of structure-function-constrained probability-weighted ensembles of valence DF replicas and use of an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. The DFs obtained express qualitatively sound features of light-meson structure, e.g., the effects of Higgs boson couplings into QCD and the size of heavy-quark momentum fractions in light hadrons. In order to improve the results, additional and more precise data on the $u$-quark-in-kaon, $u^K$, to $u$-quark-in-pion, $u^\pi$, DF ratio would be necessary. Of greater value would be extraction of $u^K$ alone, thereby avoiding inference from the ratio: currently, the data-based form of $u^K$ is materially influenced by results for $u^\pi$.</description>

      <title>Scale-invariant total decay width $\Gamma(H\to b\bar{b})$ using the novel method of characteristic operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method of using the characteristic operator (CO) ${\cal \hat{D}}_{n_{\gamma},n_{\beta}}$ to formalize the principle of maximum conformality (PMC) procedures. Using the CO formulism, we are able to facilitate the derivation of complex scenarios within a structured theoretical framework, leading to simpler procedures and more compact expressions. Using the CO formulism, together with the renormalization group equation of $\alpha_s$ and/or the quark-mass anomalous dimension, we reproduce all previous formulas, moreover, we are able to achieve a scheme-and-scale invariant perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) series by fixing correct effective magnitude of $\alpha_s$ and the running mass simultaneously. Both of them are then matched well with the expansion coefficients of the series, leading to the wanted scheme-and-scale invariant conformal series.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the nature of axial-vector charm-antibottom tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the electromagnetic characteristics of unconventional states may offer new insights into their internal structures. In particular, the magnetic moment attributes may serve as a crucial physical observable for differentiating exotic states with disparate configurations or spin-parity quantum numbers. As a promising avenue for research, encompassing both opportunities and challenges, an in-depth examination of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is crucial for advancing our understanding of unconventional states. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of $ \rm{I(J^{PC})} = 1(1^{+ \pm})$ $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states are analyzed in the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules by considering the diquark-antidiquark approximation, designated as type $3_c \otimes \bar 3_c$. Even though the $ \rm{I(J^{PC})} = 1(1^{+-})$ and $ \rm{I(J^{PC})} = 1(1^{++})$ $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states under examination in this study have an almost identical mass, the results of the magnetic moments show a discrepancy. This may facilitate the differentiation between quantum numbers associated with states with identical quark content. The results show that heavy quarks overcoming light quarks can determine both the sign and the magnitude of the magnetic moments of these tetraquark states. The numerical results obtained in this study suggest that the magnetic moments of $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may reveal aspects of their underlying structure, which could distinguish between their spin-parity quantum numbers and their internal structure. The results obtained regarding the magnetic moments of the $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may be checked within the context of different phenomenological approaches.</description>

      <title>High-lying states in the charmonium family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of high-lying states within the charmonium family remains incomplete, particularly in light of recent observations of charmonium states at energies above 4 GeV. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of several high-lying charmonia, focusing on the $D$-, $F$-, and $G$-wave states. A mass spectrum analysis is conducted, incorporating the unquenched effects. We then present a detailed study of the strong decay properties, including partial decay widths for two-body strong decays permitted by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule. Additionally, we explore the primary radiative decay channels associated with these states. Theoretical predictions provided here aim to guide future experimental searches for high-lying charmonium states, particularly at BESIII, Belle II and LHCb.</description>

      <title>Note on a BCS analogy of Majorana neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss an analogy between the BCS theory and the seesaw model of neutrinos. We believe that the analogy indicates some fundamental aspects of Majorana neutrinos. A paper on the issue has been recently presented, and we would like to describe the background of the paper together with our personal views on the problem. In essence, the conventional construction of a Majorana neutrino from a chiral fermion is too simplified, and we argue that one would actually have to go through a Bogoliubov-type canonical transformation to generate two Majorana fermions from an effective single Dirac fermion in the seesaw model.</description>

      <title>Tiny yet detectable WIMP-nucleon scattering cross sections in a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNG) dark matter (DM) model based on a gauged $SU(2)_x$ and a global $SU(2)_g$ symmetries. These symmetries are spontaneously broken to a global $U(1)_D$ symmetry by a vacuum expectation value of an $SU(2)_x \times SU(2)_g$ bi-fundamental scalar field. The global $SU(2)_g$ symmetry is also softly broken to a global $U(1)_D$ symmetry. Under the setup, a complex pNG boson arises. It is stabilized by $U(1)_D$ and is a DM candidate. Its scattering cross section off a nucleon is highly suppressed by small momentum transfer and thus evades the stringent constraints from DM direct detection experiments. Assuming all the couplings in the dark sector are real, a discrete symmetry arises. Consequently, in addition to the pNG DM, the lighter one of an $SU(2)_x$ gauge boson $V^0$ and a CP-odd scalar boson $a_0$ from the bi-fundamental scalar field can also serve as a DM candidate. Therefore, the model provides two-component DM scenarios. We find that the relic abundance of the DM candidates explains the measured value of the DM energy density. We also find that the pNG DM is the dominant DM component in large regions of the parameter space. In contrast to the pNG DM, both $V^0$ and $a_0$ scatter off a nucleon, and their scattering cross sections are not suppressed. However, their scattering event rates are suppressed by their number densities. Thus, the scattering cross section is effectively reduced. We show that the effective WIMP-nucleon scattering cross sections in the two-component scenarios are smaller than the current upper bounds and above the neutrino fog.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the near-side ridge structure in pp collisions via Momentum-Kick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-side ridge structure has been observed in the long-range two-particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions, such as AuAu collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and PbPb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Hydrodynamic models have successfully explained the ridge structure in heavy-ion collisions, indicating the presence of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Interestingly, similar ridge structures have been detected in high-multiplicity proton-proton and proton-lead collisions, which are classified as small systems in the LHC experiments. Because small systems have been considered insufficient to generate QGP, the applicability of theories developed for heavy-ion collisions to small systems remains controversial. Assuming that kinematic effects play a more significant role in small systems, we propose that a model based solely on kinematics can effectively describe the ridge structure. The Momentum-Kick Model (MKM) utilizes pure kinematics through momentum transfer. This model elucidates the long-range and near-side ridge structure in dihadron $\Delta\eta-\Delta\phi$ correlation by explaining that jet particles kick and rearrange medium partons along the direction of the jets. In this study, we apply the MKM to explain high multiplicity proton-proton collisions at both 13 TeV and 7 TeV in the LHC over various ranges of momenta. Furthermore, we introduce multiplicity dependence in the model to account for the 13 TeV data at various multiplicity ranges. We conclude that the MKM effectively explains the near-side ridge structure observed in proton-proton collisions. The LHC experiments have entered Run 3, achieving higher center-of-mass energies and better luminosity than Run 2. We offer $\Delta\phi$ correlation predictions for pp collisions at 14 TeV, and we suggest possible extensions of the MKM for future studies.</description>

      <title>Type I seesaw mechanism at TeV scale or below with minimal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel scenario is presented within the Type-I seesaw mechanism in which no other beyond Standard Model fields except three heavy right handed neutrinos, have been considered. Light neutrino masses around sub eV scale, could be possible at low seesaw scale around TeV or even below that. At the leading order, 6x6 seesaw mass matrix reproduces three massless neutrinos. The Dirac mass matrix with one loop corrections, breaks that massless texture and it is possible to get massive neutrinos. We have obtained the expression of mixing and Dirac CP violating phase for light neutrino mass matrix with one loop corrections. Only unknown parameters are the Yukawa couplings related to right handed neutrinos and their masses. These parameters satisfy the ATLAS, CMS experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>A revamped understanding of Cosmic Rays and Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interesting data on Gamma Ray Burts (GRBs) and Cosmic Rays (CRs) have recently been made public. GRB221009A has a record ``peak energy". The CR electron spectrum has been measured to unprecedented high energies and exhibits a ``knee" akin to the ones in all-particle or individual-element CR nuclei. IceCube has not seen high-energy neutrinos associated with GRBs. AMS has published a CR positron spectrum conducive to much speculation. We examine these data in the light of the ``CannonBall Model" of GRBs and CRs, in which they are intimately related and which they do strongly validate.</description>

      <title>Rare $ \Lambda_c $ decays and new physics effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental progress on baryonic rare decays has spurred a deeper investigation on flavor-changing neutral current transitions in the baryon sector. Within the framework of QCD sum rules, we derive a complete set of form factors for the $ \Lambda_c\to p $ process in the large recoil region and use the $z$-series parametrization to extrapolate them across the full physical range. Employing these form factors and flavor symmetries, we compute branching fractions for the decays $\Lambda_c \to p e^+ e^-$ and $\Lambda_c \to p \mu^+ \mu^-$, as well as for rare $ \Xi_c $ decay modes. We examine as well the new physics effects through specific angular observables such as the lepton forward-backward asymmetry and the fraction of longitudinally polarized dileptons. Results indicate that new physics models may be testified in baryonic rare decays, with immense data collected in running and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $B_{(s)}\rightarrow T(J^P=2^-)$ transition in light cone QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semileptonic $B_{(s)} \rightarrow T(J^P=2^-)l^+l^-$ decays induced by flavor changing neural currents are investigated within the light cone QCD sum rule method. We apply the $B$ meson distribution amplitudes up to twist-4 and calculate the relevant form factors of the $B_{(s)} \rightarrow T$ transitions, where $T=K_2,~a_2,~f_2,~\phi_2$ with $J^P=2^-$. The obtained results of the form factors then adopted in the calculations of the corresponding widths. The present results can be used in future experiments for studying the properties of $J^P=2^-$ tensor mesons.</description>

      <title>Can plasma physics establish a significant bound on long range dark matter interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter has been theorized to be charged under its own "dark electromagnetism" (dark-EM). Under this hypothesis, dark matter can behave like a cold collisionless plasma of self-interacting dark matter particles, and exhibit plasma-like instabilities with observational consequences. Using the results published in [1], which studied the degree of slowdown between two interpenetrating $e^-\,e^+$ plasma clouds due to plasma instabilities, estimates of similar interactions for colliding "dark plasmas" are explored. Comparison with astronomical observations reveals strong new constraints on dark-EM with the dark electromagnetic self-interaction $\alpha_{D} &lt; 4 \times 10^{-25}$.</description>

      <title>Drell-Yan Transverse-Momentum Spectra at N$^3$LL$'$ and Approximate N$^4$LL with SCETlib</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide state-of-the-art precision QCD predictions for the fiducial $W$ and $Z$ boson transverse momentum spectra at the LHC at N$^3$LL$'$ and approximate N$^4$LL in resummed perturbation theory, matched to available $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ fixed-order results. Our predictions consistently combine all information from across the spectrum in a unified way, ranging from the nonperturbative region of small transverse momenta to the fixed-order tail, with an emphasis on estimating the magnitude of residual perturbative uncertainties, and in particular of those related to the matching. Parametric uncertainties related to the strong coupling, the collinear PDFs, and the nonperturbative transverse momentum-dependent (TMD) dynamics are studied in detail. To assess the latter, we explicitly demonstrate how the full complexity of flavor and Bjorken $x$-dependent TMD dynamics can be captured by a single, effective nonperturbative function for the resonant production of any given vector boson at a given collider. We point out that the cumulative $p_T^Z$ cross section at the level of precision enabled by our predictions provides strong constraining power for PDF determinations at full N$^3$LO.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) can form a stable equilibrium configuration, the so-called FDM soliton. In principle, given the FDM particle mass, the profile of FDM soliton is fixed. In practice, however, there is a great diversity of structures in the Universe. In this paper, we enumerate some possible causes of such diversity, such as the effects of the gravitoelectric field, the gravitomagnetic field, an extra denser and compact FDM soliton and an ellipsoidal baryon background. And we find that the effects of the gravitomagnetic field are very weak but the effects of the others are considerable.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum effects in neutron decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intriguing phenomenon of beta decay of a free neutron in a non-plane-wave(structured) state. Our analysis covers three types of states: unpolarized vortex (Bessel) neutrons that possess nonzero orbital angular momentum (OAM), Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets, and spin-correlated OAM (spin-orbit) states characterized by unique polarization patterns. These states are of particular interest as they have recently been generated in neutron optics experiments and have promising applications in studies of quantum magnetic materials. The spectral-angular distributions (SAD) of the emitted electrons and protons are examined. We show that the high sensitivity of the protons SAD to the structure of the neutron wave packet can be used as a tool to extract the distinctive features of the non-plane-wave neutron states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the angular distribution of the emitted particles serves as a reflection of the spatial symmetries inherent to the neutron wave packet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy physics requires the generation of large numbers of simulated data samples from complex but analytically tractable distributions called matrix elements. Surrogate models, such as normalizing flows, are gaining popularity for this task due to their computational efficiency. We adopt an approach based on Flow Annealed importance sampling Bootstrap (FAB) that evaluates the differentiable target density during training and helps avoid the costly generation of training data in advance. We show that FAB reaches higher sampling efficiency with fewer target evaluations in high dimensions in comparison to other methods.</description>

      <title>New parameter region in sterile neutrino searches: a scenario to alleviate cosmological neutrino mass bound and its testability at oscillation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-precision cosmological data tighten the bound to neutrino masses and start rising a tension to the results of lab-experiment measurements, which may hint new physics in the role of neutrinos during the structure formation in the universe. A scenario with massless sterile neutrinos was proposed to alleviate the cosmological bound and recover the concordance in the measurements of neutrino masses. We revisit the scenario and discuss its testability at oscillation experiments. We find that the scenario is viable with a large active-sterile mixing that is testable at oscillation experiments. We present a numerical estimation of the sensitivity reach of the IceCube atmospheric neutrino observation to a sterile neutrino with a mass lighter than active neutrinos for the first time. IceCube shows a good sensitivity to the active-sterile mixing at the mass-square difference with a size of $\sim 0.1$ eV$^{2}$ in the case of the \textit{inverted-mass-ordering sterile neutrino}, which is forbidden under the assumption of the standard cosmology but is allowed thanks to the alleviation of the cosmological bound in this scenario.</description>

      <title>Conformal Mapping in Matching Quark Correlation Functions to Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, extracting parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the divergent nature of perturbative expansions at high orders. The presence of renormalon singularities in the Borel plane further hinders the accurate determination of PDFs, especially in the context of lattice QCD and effective field theory approaches like Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). This study explores the application of conformal mapping as a technique to improve the convergence of perturbative series for matching kernels. By transforming the Borel plane to map singularities onto the unit disk, this method mitigates the effects of divergent behavior in high-order perturbative expansions of matching kernels. The numerical analysis focuses on the matching kernel for quark correlation functions (QCFs), using the CT18NNLO PDFs for u-quarks and d-quarks, along with N3LO hard kernel inputs. The results demonstrate that conformal mapping enhances the stability of the perturbative series, reducing the root-mean-square (RMS) error by up to $40\%$ compared to conventional $\alpha_s$ series. These findings highlight the potential of conformal mapping to enhance the precision of PDFs and reduce theoretical uncertainties in high-order QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>How well does nonrelativistic QCD factorization work at next-to-leading order?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a thorough investigation of the universality of the long distance matrix elements (LDMEs) of nonrelativistic QCD factorization based on a next-to-leading order (NLO) fit of $J/\psi$ color octet (CO) LDMEs to high transverse momentum $p_T$ $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ production data at the LHC. We thereby apply a novel fit-and-predict procedure to systematically take into account scale variations, and predict various observables never studied in this context before. In particular, the LDMEs can well describe $J/\psi$ hadroproduction up to the highest measured values of $p_T$, as well as $\Upsilon(nS)$ production via potential NRQCD based relations. Furthermore, $J/\psi$ production in $\gamma \gamma$ and $\gamma p$ collisions is surprisingly reproduced down to $p_T=1$ GeV, as long as the region of large inelasticity $z$ is excluded, which may be of significance in future quarkonium studies, in particular at the EIC and the high-luminosity LHC. In addition, our summary reveals an interesting pattern as to which observables still evade a consistent description.</description>

      <title>Analytical Solution of the Nonlinear Boltzmann Equation with Non-isotropic Scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a massless gas with a non-isotropic cross section is given in a homogeneous spacetime. By employing a trial solution, we construct a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments and solve this set exactly. Our analytical solution with nontrivial scattering angle dependence contained can be mapped onto the BKW solution of a homogeneous nonrelativistic gas of Maxwell molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a feasible region determined by physical requirements. The analytical solution with parameters within the feasible region admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution of the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic moment of a hadron is an important spectroscopic parameter as its mass and encodes valuable information about its internal structure. In this present study, we systematically study magnetic moments of the $P_{c}(4457)$ and its related hidden-charm pentaquark states with and without strangeness employing a comprehensive analysis that encompasses diquark-diquark-antiquark scheme with $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$, $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \frac{5}{2}^-$ quantum numbers. Some of the obtained magnetic moments agree well with the available theoretical results. The predicted magnetic moment values together with alongside results existing in the literature, may offer insights into their underlying structures, and consequently their spin-parity quantum numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consideration is being given to upgrade the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider with the introduction of electron beam polarization as a means of accessing a unique precision electroweak physics program. The upgrade would enable Belle II to make a number of precise measurements, one of which is the left-right asymmetry present in the e+e-$\rightarrow$e+e- Bhabha scattering process. The expected level of precision in such a measurement will require the theoretical values of the asymmetry to be calculated at least to the next-to-leading order (NLO) level, and the implementation of simulation event generators with a similar level of precision. In this paper we compare the calculations of the ReneSANCe generator to those of an independent NLO calculation as well as make projections for the uncertainties expected in SuperKEKB/Belle II upgraded with polarized electron beams.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation group evolution of the shape function $g_{17}$ in $\bar{B}\to X_s \gamma$ and $\bar{B} \to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ at subleading power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and solve the renormalisation-group (RG) equation of the shape function $g_{17}(\omega,\omega_1;\mu)$, which appears at subleading power in the factorization of the inclusive decays $\bar{B} \to X_s \gamma$ and $\bar B \to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$. Our results provide the first ingredient for a next-to-leading order analysis of the respective resolved-photon ${Q}^{c}_{1} - {Q}_{7\gamma}$ interference contribution, whose current uncertainties are among the largest ones in both inclusive penguin modes. As a by-product of our study, we find that the analytic properties of the soft anomalous dimension as well as the jet functions in a factorization theorem allow for a simplified renormalisation of operators in Heavy-Quark Effective Theory that are composed of fields smeared along distinct light-cone directions. Their hadronic matrix elements become relevant in various inclusive and exclusive $B$-decays beyond leading power in the heavy-quark and large-energy expansion. Using these insights, we derive and solve a simpler ``reduced'' RG equation of an amplitude-level soft function that describes the long-distance QCD dynamics for penguin contributions to exclusive $\bar{B}_{d,s} \to \gamma \gamma$ decays, and which has recently been discussed in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) involves the identification of rare signals over conventional backgrounds. Thus binary classification tasks are ubiquitous in analyses of the vast amounts of LHC data. We develop a Lie-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lie-EQGNN), a quantum model that is not only data efficient, but also has symmetry-preserving properties. Since Lorentz group equivariance has been shown to be beneficial for jet tagging, we build a Lorentz-equivariant quantum GNN for quark-gluon jet discrimination and show that its performance is on par with its classical state-of-the-art counterpart LorentzNet, making it a viable alternative to the conventional computing paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a procedure for handling asymmetric errors. Many results in particle physics are presented as values with different positive and negative errors, and there is no consistent procedure for handling them. We consider the difference between errors quoted using pdfs and using likelihoods, and the difference between the rms spread of a measurement and the 68\% central confidence region. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the possibilities, and software tools to enable their use.</description>

      <title>Condensation of Magnetic Fluxes and Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I discuss new non-perturbative solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation representing the superposition of oppositely oriented chromomagnetic flux tubes (vortices) similar in their form to a lattice of superposed Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen chromomagnetic vortices. These solutions represent highly degenerate classical vacua of the Yang Mills theory that are separated by potential barriers and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. It is suggested that the solutions describe a lattice of dense chromomagnetic vortices representing a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor.</description>

      <title>Effective Theory Building and Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manifold learning and effective model building are generally viewed as fundamentally different types of procedure. After all, in one we build a simplified model of the data, in the other, we construct a simplified model of the another model. Nonetheless, I argue that certain kinds of high-dimensional effective model building, and effective field theory construction in quantum field theory, can be viewed as special cases of manifold learning. I argue that this helps to shed light on all of these techniques. First, it suggests that the effective model building procedure depends upon a certain kind of algorithmic compressibility requirement. All three approaches assume that real-world systems exhibit certain redundancies, due to regularities. The use of these regularities to build simplified models is essential for scientific progress in many different domains.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free determination of critical exponents and chiral phase transition temperature in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to quantify the universal properties of the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we make use of an improved, renormalized order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking which is obtained as a suitable difference of the $2$-flavor light quark chiral condensate and its corresponding light quark susceptibility. Having no additive ultraviolet as well as multiplicative logarithmic divergences, we use ratios of this order parameter constructed from its values for two different light quark masses. We show that this facilitates determining in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ which, for sufficiently small values of the light quark masses, controls the quark mass dependence of the order parameter at $T_c$. We present first results of these calculations from our numerical analysis performed with staggered fermions on $N_\tau=8$ lattices.</description>

      <title>Critical fluid dynamics in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a numerical method for simulating stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the Ising universality class. This theory is known as model H, and is expected to govern the non-equilibrium dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) near a possible critical endpoint of the phase transition between a hadron liquid and the quark-gluon plasma. The numerical algorithm is based on a Metropolis scheme, and automatically ensures that the distribution function of the hydrodynamic variables in equilibrium is independent of the transport coefficients and only governed by the microscopic free energy. We verify dynamic scaling near the critical point of a two and three-dimensional fluid and extract the associated critical exponent $z$. We find $z\simeq 3$ in three dimensions, and $z\simeq 2$ for a two-dimensional fluid. In a finite system, we observe a crossover between the mean field value $z=4$ and the true critical exponent $z\simeq 3$ ($z \simeq 2$ in $d=2$). This crossover is governed by the values of the correlation length and the renormalized shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Disruption of Axion Minihalos by Multiple Stellar Encounters in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If QCD axion dark matter formed post-inflation, axion miniclusters emerged from isocurvature fluctuations and later merged hierarchically into minihalos. These minihalos, potentially disrupted by stellar encounters in the Milky Way, affect axion detectability. We extend prior analyses by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential.
  Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for.
  The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This work highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.</description>

Abstract: We study a spatial-temporal structure of quantum fluctuations in the stress-energy tensor of zero-point modes for a scalar field in order to formulate a covariant model. The model describes an invariant vacuum contribution to the cosmological constant in the non-stationary coherent state in a finite volume.

      <title>Wiggly dilaton: a landscape of spontaneously broken scale invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dilaton emerges as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) associated with the spontaneous breaking of scale invariance in a nearly conformal field theory (CFT). We show the existence of a wiggly dilaton potential that contains multiple vacuum solutions in a five-dimensional (5D) holographic formulation. The wiggly feature originates from boundary potentials of a 5D axion-like scalar field, whose naturally small bulk mass parameter corresponds to a marginally-relevant deformation of the dual CFT. Depending on the energy density of a boundary $3$-brane, our model can be used to generate a light dilaton or provide a relaxion potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation function observed in high-energy collision experiments encodes critical information about the emitted source and hadronic interactions. While the proton-proton interaction potential is well constrained by nucleon-nucleon scattering data, these measurements offer a unique avenue to investigate the proton-emitting source, reflecting the dynamical properties of the collisions. In this Letter, we present an unbiased approach to reconstruct proton-emitting sources from experimental correlation functions. Within an automatic differentiation framework, we parameterize the source functions with deep neural networks, to compute correlation functions. This approach achieves a lower chi-squared value compared to conventional Gaussian source functions and captures the long-tail behavior, in qualitative agreement with simulation predictions.</description>

      <title>The non-linear dynamics of axion inflation: a detailed lattice study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the fully inhomogeneous non-linear dynamics of axion inflation, identifying three regimes: weak-, mild-, and strong-backreaction, depending on the duration of inflation. We use lattice techniques that explicitly preserve gauge invariance and shift symmetry, and which we validate against other computational methods of the linear dynamics and of the homogeneous backreaction regime. Notably, we demonstrate that the latter fails to accurately describe the truly local dynamics of strong backreaction. We investigate the convergence of simulations of local backreaction, determining the requirements to achieve an accurate description of the dynamics, and providing useful parametrizations of the delay of the end of inflation. Additionally, we identify key features emerging from a proper local treatment of strong backreaction: the dominance of magnetic energy against the electric counterpart, the excitation of the longitudinal mode, and the generation of a scale-dependent chiral (im)balance. Our results underscore the necessity to accurately capture the local nature of the non-linear dynamics of the system, in order to correctly assess phenomenological predictions, such as e.g. the production of gravitational waves and primordial black holes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic solutions for expanding bubbles in cosmological first-order phase transitions going beyond local thermal equilibrium approximation. Under the assumption of a tangenosidal field profile, we supplement the matching conditions with the entropy produced due to the interaction of the bubble wall with ambient plasma. This allows us to analytically compute the corresponding fluid profiles and find bubble-wall velocity. We show that due to the entropy production, two stable solutions corresponding to a deflagration or hybrid and a detonation can coexist. Finally, we use numerical real-time simulations of bubble growth to show that in such cases it is typically the faster detonation solution which is realised. This effect can be explained in terms of the fluid profile not being fully formed into the predicted steady-state solution as the wall accelerates past this slower solution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $R_D$ and $R_{D^*}$ anomalies in a low scale left-right symmetric model based on $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ with a simplified Higgs sector consisting of only one bidoublet and one $SU(2)_R$ doublet. The Wilson coefficients relevant to the transition $b\to c\tau \nu$ are derived by integrating out the charged Higgs $H^\pm$ boson, which gives the dominant contributions. We emphasize that the charged Higgs effects, with the complex right-handed quark mixing matrix, can account for both $R_D$ and $R_{D^*}$ anomalies simultaneously, while adhering to a set of significant constraints including, for instance, ${\rm BR}(B^-_c \to \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau) $ and $B_{s(d)}-\bar B_{s(d)}$ mixing. In relation to this, we show that the predicted values of the $D^\ast$, $\tau$ longitudinal polarizations and $P_\tau (D)$ can be affected for the set of the parameters of the model resolving the $R_{D,D^\ast}$ anomalies.</description>

Abstract: The MUST (Mass Unspecific Supervised Tagging) method has proven to be successful in implementing generic jet taggers capable of discriminating various signals over a wide range of jet masses. We implement the MUST concept by using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers instead of neural networks (NNs) as previously done. We build both fully-generic and specific multi-pronged taggers, to identify 2, 3, and/or 4-pronged signals from SM QCD background. We show that XGBoost-based taggers are not only easier to optimize and much faster than those based in NNs, but also show quite similar performance, even when testing with signals not used in training. Therefore, they provide a quite efficient alternative machine-learning implementation for generic jet taggers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can undergo significant growth through superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale and transforming black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between boson fields and fermions may lead to parametric production or Schwinger pair production of fermions, with efficiencies significantly exceeding those of perturbative decay processes. Additionally, the spatial gradients of scalar clouds and the electric components of vector clouds can accelerate fermions, resulting in observable fluxes. This study considers both Standard Model neutrinos and dark sector fermions, which could contribute to boosted dark matter. Energy loss due to fermion emissions can potentially quench the exponential growth of the cloud, leading to a saturated state. This dynamic provides a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, previously constrained by neutrino self-interaction considerations. In the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to accelerate fermions to TeV energies, producing fluxes that surpass those from atmospheric neutrinos near black holes. These fluxes open new avenues for observations through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection efforts focused on targeted black holes.</description>

Abstract: The continued interest in placing bounds on the neutron's Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) is due to the implications regarding the characteristics of the strong interaction and, in particular, its behavior under the CP symmetry. In this work, we discuss the apparent tension resulting from the discrepancy of about 13 orders of magnitude between the current bounds and the expected quantum uncertainty in the relevant quantity. We offer a resolution of the "puzzle" in terms of the notion of a weak measurement, using a version of the corresponding formalism adapted to consideration of the nEDM experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</description>

Abstract: As electromagnetic showers may alter the abundance of Helium, Lithium, and Deuterium, we can place severe constraints on the lifetime and amount of electromagnetic energy injected by long-lived particles. Considering up-to-date measurements of the light element abundances that point to $Y_p=0.245\pm 0.003$, $({\rm D/H})= (2.527\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-5}$, and the baryon-to-photon ratio obtained from the Cosmic Microwave Background data, $\eta=6.104 \times 10^{-10}$, we derive upper limits on the fraction of electromagnetic energy produced by long-lived particles.

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark states in a mass splitting model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treating the $X(4140)$ as a compact $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ state and using its mass as a reference scale, we systematically estimate the masses of doubly heavy tetraquark states $QQ\bar{q}\bar{q}$ where $Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d,s$. Their decay properties are studied with a simple rearrangement scheme. Based on our results, the lowest $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$ state is a stable tetraquark about 20 MeV below the $\bar{B}^*\bar{B}$ threshold. The mass and width of the low-mass $0(1^+)$ $cc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ ($n=u,d$) tetraquark are compatible with the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ observed by the LHCb Collaboration. The location of the lowest $0(0^+)$ and $0(1^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ states are found to be close to the $\bar{B}D$ and $\bar{B}^*D$ thresholds, respectively. We hope that the predicted ratios between partial widths of different channels may be helpful to identify compact tetraquark states from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Fermionic UV models for neutral triple gauge boson vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for anomalous neutral triple gauge boson couplings (NTGCs) provide important tests for the gauge structure of the standard model. In SMEFT ("standard model effective field theory") NTGCs appear only at the level of dimension-8 operators. While the phenomenology of these operators has been discussed extensively in the literature, renormalizable UV models that can generate these operators are scarce. In this work, we study a variety of extensions of the SM with heavy fermions and calculate their matching to d = 8 NTGC operators. We point out that the complete matching of UV models requires four different CP-conserving d = 8 operators and that the single CPC d = 8 operator, most commonly used by the experimental collaborations, does not describe all possible NTGC form factors. Despite stringent experimental constraints on NTGCs, limits on the scale of UV models are relatively weak, because their contributions are doubly suppressed (being d = 8 and 1-loop). We suggest a series of benchmark UV scenarios suitable for interpreting searches for NTGCs in the upcoming LHC runs, obtain their current limits and provide estimates for the expected sensitivity of the high-luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Effects of gravitational particle production on Higgs portal dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational interaction is ubiquitous and the effect of gravitational particle production necessarily contributes to the dark matter abundance. A simple candidate of dark matter is a scalar particle, whose only renormalizable interaction is the Higgs portal coupling. We show that the abundance of Higgs portal dark matter is significantly affected by the gravitational production effect. In particular, the gravitational production from the coherently oscillating inflaton field during the reheating often gives dominant contribution.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter direct detection experiments are going to touch the neutrino floor with a good chance to measure coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) and a probe of neutrino-related new physics ($\nu$NP). In this study, we emphatically investigate the simultaneous presence of dark matter and $\nu$NP revealing a response resembling of Standard Model neutrino backgrounds in Xenon-based dark matter experiments. Demonstrated by three U(1) extension models, we figure out that dark matter signals can be distinguished from an excess or a depletion of neutrino contributions from $\nu$NP by a statistically defined distinction method in nuclear and electronic recoil spectra. We also present the influence of $\nu$NP on the exclusion limits for spin-independent dark matter-nucleon interactions. Our work might pave the way for new physics discrimination in future dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Aligned Yet Large Dipoles: a SMEFT Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-universal flavor scenario at the level of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, according to which the matrix of Wilson coefficients $c_{uW}$ of an up-type electroweak quark dipole operator is aligned with the up-type Yukawa coupling. Such an alignment usually follows from the assumption of Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV), away from which we step by allowing the entries of $c_{uW}$ to be sizable along the first quark generations. A particular example, which we refer to as ``inverse hierarchy MFV", features Wilson coefficients inversely proportional to quark masses, and arises from BSM models respecting MFV and containing heavy fields that replicate the mass hierarchy of SM quarks. We then analyze the phenomenology driven by $c_{uW}$ at colliders and at lower-energy flavor experiments. We show that precision measurements of the process $pp\rightarrow W h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma\ell\nu$ at FCC-$hh$ could set an upper bound on $|c_{uW}|\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})(\Lambda/{\rm TeV})^{2}$, with $\Lambda$ the cutoff of the effective field theory. This bound is an order of magnitude stronger than the existing LHC bounds. Moreover, we estimate that $W h\rightarrow b\bar b \ell\nu$ at HL-LHC could also give competitive bounds. In the low-energy regime, we consider bounds arising from rare kaon decays, which turn out to be loose, $|c_{uW}^{11}|&lt;\mathcal{O}(1)(\Lambda/{\rm TeV})^{2}$. We finally demonstrate that our flavor and operator assumptions can be derived from a weakly-coupled UV model, which we choose to simultaneously illustrate the UV origin of inverse hierarchy MFV.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the L3 BEC at Z$^0$-pole -- Comparison of the conventional formula against the $\tau$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The L3 Collaboration reported data on 2-jet and 3-jet Bose--Einstein correlations (BECs) with the results obtained through the $\tau$-model in 2011. In this study, we analyze these correlations using the conventional formula with the Gaussian long-range correlation (${\rm CF_I\times LRC_{(Gauss)}}$). The estimated ranges of interactions for 2-jet and 3-jet, $R_{\rm 2-jet}$ and $R_{\rm 3-jet}$, are almost the same magnitude as those by $\tau$-model: $R_{\rm 2-jet}=0.83\pm 0.05$ (stat) fm and $R_{\rm 3-jet}=1.09\pm 0.04$ (stat) fm. The anticorrelation in BEC (less than 1.0) observed by the L3 Collaboration is related to the partially negative density profile ($\rho_{\rm \tau, BE}(\xi)$ in $\xi$ space) in the $\tau$-model and the ${\rm LRC_{(Gauss)}}=1/(1+\alpha e^{-\beta Q^2})$ in ${\rm CF_I\times LRC_{(Gauss)}}$, respectively. Remarkably, the probability $P_{\tau}(\xi)$ calculated from the Levy canonical form exhibits partially negative behavior.</description>

      <title>Seeking a coherent explanation of LHC excesses for compressed spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most recent searches by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in final states with soft leptons and missing transverse energy show mild excesses predominantly associated with dilepton invariant masses of about 10-20 GeV, which can result from decays of electroweakinos that are heavier than the lightest neutralino by O(10) GeV. On the other hand, these analyses are insensitive to electroweakino mass splittings smaller than about 5 GeV. In previous work, we demonstrated that while recent searches in the monojet channel can exclude some of the smallest O(1) GeV mass splitting configurations for electroweakinos, they also exhibit excesses that can overlap with the soft-lepton excesses in certain models, including a simplified scenario with pure higgsinos. In this work we dive deeper into these excesses, studying the analyses in detail and exploring an array of models that go beyond the simplified scenarios considered by the experimental collaborations. We show that, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the overlapping excesses are not unique to the pure-higgsino limit, instead persisting in realistic parameter space featuring a bino-like lightest supersymmetric particle with some wino admixture. On the other hand, for the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with a singlino-like lightest supersymmetric particle and higgsino-like next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle(s), the excess in the two-lepton channel fits rather well with the parameter space predicting the correct relic abundance through freeze out, but the monojet fit is much poorer. Interestingly, the excesses either do not overlap or do not exist at all for two non-supersymmetric models seemingly capable of producing the correct final states.</description>

Abstract: One of purposes for High Energy accelerator experiments is confrontation of theory and measurements in ever new realms. Any new agreement extends theory applicability domain, any discrepancy hints to unexplained. That calls for better calculations or new, deeper theory. Often one has to search for small contributions over large Standard Model background. Multi-dimensional signatures and complex background subtraction cuts imply that Monte Carlo techniques are indispensable.

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram and the Finite Volume Fireball: A Model Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental investigations of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter involve collisions of heavy ions at ultrarelativistic velocities. The medium created in such a collision is often of dimensions a few fermi, in particular in the Beam Energy Scan experiments. An understanding of the effect of the finite volume and the boundary is important for connecting the experimental results to the phase diagram.
  Using the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model, an effective theory for the chiral transition of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), we have studied the effect of the finite volume of the fireball on the transition line at finite temperature and density using the MIT boundary condition to mimic the condition that the system is deconfined inside. The shift of the transition temperature for finite volume and finite volume effect on number density and its susceptibilities are studied. The volume effects should be considered when looking for signatures of the phase diagram in experiments.</description>

Abstract: This report summarizes the latest developments in the CTEQ-TEA global analysis of parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the nucleon. The focus is on recent NNLO fits to high-precision LHC data at 8 and 13 TeV, including Drell-Yan, jet, and top-quark pair production, pursued on the way toward the release of the new generation of CTEQ-TEA general-purpose PDFs. The report also discusses advancements in statistical and numerical methods for PDF determination and uncertainty quantification, highlighting the importance of robust and replicable uncertainties for high-stakes observables. Additionally, it covers phenomenological studies related to PDF determination, such as the interplay of experimental constraints, exploration of correlations between high-$x$ nucleon sea and low-energy parity-violating measurements, fitted charm in the nucleon, the photon PDF in the neutron, and simultaneous SMEFT-PDF analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the scalar and Dirac fields perturbation of Schwarzschild-de Sitter-like black hole in bumblebee gravity model. The effective potentials, greybody factors and quasinormal modes of the black hole are investigated by using the Klein-Gordon equation and Dirac equation. To compute the greybody factors for scalar and Dirac fields, we use the general method of rigorous bound. We also investigate the quasinormal mode using the third order WKB approximation method and P\"{o}schl-Teller fitting method. The impact of Lorentz invariance violation parameter $L$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to the effective potential, greybody factors and quasinormal modes are analyzed for different modes. Increasing the parameters $\Lambda$ and $L$ lower the effective potentials and consequently increases the rigorous bound on the greybody factors. Our findings show that the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease with increasing $L$. We analyze the Hawking temperature, power spectrum and sparsity of Hawking radiation. Both the peak of power spectrum and total power emitted decrease with increasing $L$. The effect of $L$ on the shadow radius is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Final-state rescattering mechanism of charmed baryon decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical studies on the non-leptonic weak decays of charmed baryons are always challenging, due to the large non-perturbative contributions at the charm scale. In this work, we develop the final-state rescattering mechanism to study the two-body non-leptonic decays of charmed baryons. The final-state interaction is a physical picture of long-distance effects. Instead of using the Cutkosky rule to calculate the hadronic triangle diagrams which can only provide the imaginary part of decay amplitudes, we point out that the loop integral is more appropriate, as both the real parts and the imaginary parts of amplitudes can be calculated completely. In this way, it can be obtained for the non-trivial strong phases which are essential to calculate CP violations. With the physical picture of long-distance effects and the reasonable method of calculations, it is amazingly achieved that all the nine existing experimental data of branching fractions for the $\Lambda_c^+$ decays into an octet light baryon and a vector meson can be explained by only one parameter of the model. Besides, the decay asymmetries and CP violations are not sensitive to the model parameter, since the dependence on the parameter is mainly cancelled in the ratios, so that the theoretical uncertainties on these observables are lowered down.</description>

Abstract: Photons impinging on strong electromagnetic fields can change both momentum and helicity state, due to quantum vacuum polarisation. We investigate these effects in the collision of photons with impulsive PP-waves, which describe e.g. the fields of ultra-boosted charge distributions. We connect our results to vacuum birefringence and quantum reflection in both QED and SUSY QED. We also compare with helicity flip in plane wave backgrounds, exploring how and when known tree-level relations, relating amplitudes in PP-waves and in plane waves, extend to one-loop corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The seven-gluon two-loop full-color Yang-Mills amplitude is presented in a compact analytic form where we use the methods of four-dimensional unitarity cuts to obtain the polylogarithmic pieces and augmented recursion to obtain the rational pieces. Furthermore, an $n$-point form for the full-color polylogarithmic piece is presented. We use these results to probe for potential relations amongst the two-loop partial amplitudes.</description>

      <title>A comparison of Bayesian sampling algorithms for high-dimensional particle physics and cosmology applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For several decades now, Bayesian inference techniques have been applied to theories of particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics to obtain the probability density functions of their free parameters. In this study, we review and compare a wide range of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling techniques to determine their relative efficacy on functions that resemble those encountered most frequently in the particle astrophysics literature. Our first series of tests explores a series of high-dimensional analytic test functions that exemplify particular challenges, for example highly multimodal posteriors or posteriors with curving degeneracies. We then investigate two real physics examples, the first being a global fit of the $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmic microwave background data from the Planck experiment, and the second being a global fit of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model using a wide variety of collider and astrophysics data. We show that several examples widely thought to be most easily solved using nested sampling approaches can in fact be more efficiently solved using modern MCMC algorithms, but the details of the implementation matter. Furthermore, we also provide a series of useful insights for practitioners of particle astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos are neutral in the Standard Model, but they have tiny charge radii generated by radiative corrections. In theories Beyond the Standard Model, neutrinos can also have magnetic and electric moments and small electric charges (millicharges). We review the general theory of neutrino electromagnetic form factors, which reduce, for ultrarelativistic neutrinos and small momentum transfers, to the neutrino charges, effective charge radii, and effective magnetic moments. We discuss the phenomenology of these electromagnetic neutrino properties and we review the existing experimental bounds. We briefly review also the electromagnetic processes of astrophysical neutrinos and the neutrino magnetic moment portal in the presence of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Hilbert series for quark flavor invariants and CP violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work delves into the study of flavor invariants and, in special, invariants capable of detecting CP (Charge-Parity) violation. Through the mathematical tool of the Hilbert series, we systematically enumerate and explore flavor invariants that are unchanged under weak basis transformations. After reviewing the Hilbert series and the flavor invariants of the SM quark sector, we apply the tool of Hilbert series to the SM extended by a singlet vector-like quark (VLQ) of down-type. The introduction of these hypothetical particles leads to a simple extension of the SM that can be motivated by many problems, including the need for new sources of CP violation to explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. We were successful in calculating the Hilbert series for the VLQ extension in the mass basis of the VLQ, where the spurion transformations are simpler. Based on the Hilbert series, we build and enumerate the basic flavor invariants with which all invariants can be constructed. For a generic basis, where the spurion transformations involve a larger group, we could only get the first few terms of the Hilbert series.</description>

We also compute the square of this current and discuss the resulting color correlations, featuring dipole correlations and three-parton correlations.

      <title>Effect of invisible neutrino decay on neutrino oscillation at long baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effect of invisible neutrino decay of the third neutrino state for accelerator neutrino experiments at two different baselines, 1300 km with a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detector (similar to DUNE) and 2588 km with a water Cherenkov detector (similar to P2O). For such baselines, the matter effect starts to become important. Our aim is to ascertain the sensitivity to mass hierarchy and octant of $\theta_{23}$ in these two experiments in the presence of a decaying neutrino state. We compare and contrast the results of the two experimental setups. We find that, in general, hierarchy sensitivity decreases in the presence of decay. However, if we consider decay only in the opposite hierarchy (test scenario), in the 2588 km setup, the hierarchy sensitivity with the true hierarchy as IH is larger than the no decay case. We also study the dependence of hierarchy sensitivity with true $\theta_{23}$. We find that the dominant muon background in P2O plays an important role in how the hierarchy sensitivity depends on $\theta_{23}$. The octant sensitivity for both setups increases in the presence of decay except for the LArTPC setup in case true $\theta_{23}=49^\circ$. To understand the octant sensitivity results in the two setups, we check the synergy in sensitivity between electron and muon channels as a function of test $\theta_{23}$. We also study the degeneracies in the test $\theta_{23}-\delta_{CP}$ plane and find that combined analysis of the two setups removes all the degeneracies in the test $\theta_{23}-\delta_{CP}$ plane at $5\sigma$ significance.</description>

      <title>Copositive criteria for a two-component dark matter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-component scalar dark matter model in this work, where the scalars are stabilized by extra $Z_2 \times Z'_2$ symmetry. To guarantee the stability of the vacuum, we consider the copositive criteria and different choices of the signs of the couplings will contribute to different viable parameter spaces. Based on the copositive criteria, we systematically analyze the possible conditions and pick up 17 different cases with fixing some parameters to be negative. We randomly scan the parameter space under dark matter relic density constraint and direct detection constraint and focus on the quartic couplings with $\lambda_{13}$,$\lambda_{23}$,$\lambda_{14}$ and $\lambda_{24}$. The shapes of the viable parameter space for $|\lambda_{14}|-|\lambda_{24}|$ are almost similar among these cases, while for $|\lambda_{13}|$ and $|\lambda_{23}|$, the larger value are excluded as long as $\lambda_{13}\leqslant 0$ and $\lambda_{23}\leqslant 0$ due to the large interference effect of the $2 \to 2$ processes.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ evolution of dipole amplitude in momentum space: forward--off-forward correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have shown that the small-$x$ evolution of the off-forward leading-log dipole scattering amplitudes, both pomeron and odderon, in the momentum space can be completely determined by the evolution of the respective forward amplitudes, with rescaled momenta. In position space, if there is translation symmetry (assumption of a large nucleus), the dipole cross section depends on the positions of quarks and anti-quarks only through their separation. The present study is an equivalent proposition in the momentum space -- where translation symmetry in momentum bifurcates the amplitudes into two translationally symmetric functions along the ${\bf k}$ line in the ${\bf k}-{\bf \Delta}$ plane. It also shows that high energy evolutions of dipole GTMDs can be achieved only by studying the evolution of dipole TMDs at small-$x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic full weak-neutral axial-vector four-current distributions inside a general spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system are systematically studied for the first time, where the second-class current contribution associated with the induced (pseudo-)tensor form factor (FF) is included. For experimental measurements, we explicitly derive the first exact full tree-level unpolarized differential cross sections of both (anti)neutrino-nucleon and (anti)neutrino-antinucleon elastic scatterings. We clearly demonstrate that the 3D axial charge distribution in the Breit frame, being purely imaginary and parity-odd, is in fact related to the induced (pseudo-)tensor FF $G_T^Z(Q^2)$ rather than the axial FF $G_A^Z(Q^2)$. We study the frame-dependence of full axial-vector four-current distributions for a moving system, and compared them with their light-front counterparts. We clarify the role played by Melosh rotations, and classify the origin of distortions in light-front distributions into three key sources using the lemma that we have proposed and verified in this work. In particular, we show that the second-class current contribution, although explicitly included, does not contribute in fact to the mean-square axial and spin radii. We finally illustrate our results in the case of a proton using the weak-neutral axial-vector FFs extracted from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Insights into Quark-Antiquark Interactions: Probing Field Distributions and String Tension in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between quark-antiquark pairs is essential for elucidating quark confinement within the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the field distribution patterns that arise between these pairs by employing advanced machine learning techniques, namely multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN), to analyze data obtained from lattice QCD simulations. The models developed through this training are then applied to calculate the string tension and width associated with chromo flux tubes, and these results are rigorously compared to those derived from lattice QCD. Moreover, we introduce a preliminary analytical expression that characterizes the field distribution as a function of quark separation, utilizing the KAN methodology. Our comprehensive quantitative analysis underscores the potential of integrating machine learning approaches into conventional QCD research.</description>

      <title>Separation of Infrared and Bulk in Thermal QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new thermal regime of QCD, featuring decoupled scale-invariant infrared glue, has been proposed to exist both in pure-glue (N$_f$=0) and ``real-world" (N$_f$=2+1 at physical quark masses) QCD. In this {\it IR phase}, elementary degrees of freedom flood the infrared, forming a distinct component independent from the bulk. This behavior necessitates non-analyticities in the theory. In pure-glue QCD, such non-analyticities have been shown to arise via Anderson-like mobility edges in Dirac spectra ($\lambda_{\rm IR} \!=\! 0$, $\pm \lambda_\text{A} \!\neq\! 0$), as manifested in the dimension function $d_{\rm IR} (\lambda)$. Here, we present the first evidence, based on lattice QCD calculation at $a$=0.105 fm, that this mechanism is also at work in real-world QCD, thus supporting the existence of the proposed IR regime in nature. An important aspect of our results is that, while at $T\!=\!234\,$MeV we find a dimensional jump between zero modes and lowest near-zero modes very close to unity ($d_{\rm IR} \!=\!3$ to $d_{\rm IR} \!\simeq\! 2$), similar to the IR phase of pure-glue QCD, at $T\!=\!187\,$MeV we observe a continuous $\lambda$-dependence. This suggests that thermal states just {\it above} the chiral crossover are non-analytically (in $T$) connected to thermal state at $T\!=\!234\,$MeV, supporting the key original proposition that the transition into the IR regime occurs at a temperature strictly above the chiral crossover.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Reactor Safeguarding with Neutrino Detection for MOX Loading Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resurgence of interest in nuclear power around the world highlights the importance of effective methods to safeguard against nuclear proliferation. Many powerful safeguarding techniques have been developed and are currently employed, but new approaches are needed to address proliferation challenges from emerging advanced reactor designs and fuel cycles. Building on prior work that demonstrated monitoring of nuclear reactor operation using neutrino detectors, we develop and present a simple quantitative statistical test suitable for analysis of measured reactor neutrino data and demonstrate its efficacy in a semi-cooperative reactor monitoring scenario. In this approach, a moderate-sized neutrino detector is placed near the reactor site to help monitor possible MOX fuel diversion independent of inspection-based monitoring. We take advantage of differing time-dependent neutrino count rates during the operating cycle of a reactor core to monitor any deviations of measurements from expectations given a declared fuel composition. For a five-ton idealized detector placed 25m away from a hypothetical 3565 MWth reactor, the statistical test is capable of detecting the diversion of ~80kg plutonium at the 95% confidence level 90% of the time over a 540-day observation period.</description>

      <title>Probing modified Hawking evaporation with gravitational waves from the primordial black hole dominated universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that Hawking evaporation might slow down after a black hole has lost about half of its mass. Such an effect, called "memory burden", is parameterized as a suppression in the mass loss rate by negative powers $n$ of the black hole entropy and could considerably extend the lifetime of a black hole. We study the impact of memory burden on the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario. Modified PBH evaporation leads to a significantly longer PBH dominated stage. Requiring that PBHs evaporate prior enough to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis shrinks the allowed PBH mass range. Indeed, we find that for $n&gt;2.5$ the PBH reheating scenario is not viable. The frequency of the Gravitational Waves (GWs) induced by PBH number density fluctuations is bound to be larger than about a Hz, while the amplitude of the GW spectrum is enhanced due to the longer PBH dominated phase. Interestingly, we show that, in some models, the slope of the induced GW spectrum might be sensitive to the modifications to Hawking evaporation, proving it may be possible to test the "memory burden" effect via induced GWs. Lastly, we argue that our results could also apply to general modifications of Hawking evaporation.</description>

      <title>Robust inference of gravitational wave source parameters in the presence of noise transients using normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection is of paramount importance in fundamental physics and GW astronomy, yet it presents formidable challenges. One significant challenge is the removal of noise transient artifacts known as glitches, which greatly impact the search and identification of GWs. Recent research has achieved remarkable results in data denoising, often using effective modeling methods to remove glitches. However, for glitches from uncertain or unknown sources, current methods cannot completely eliminate them from the GW signal. In this work, we leverage the inherent robustness of machine learning to obtain reliable posterior parameter distributions directly from GW data contaminated by glitches. Our network model provides reasonable and rapid parameter inference even in the presence of glitches, without needing to remove them. We also investigate various factors affecting the rationality of parameter inference in our normalizing flow network, including glitch and GW parameters. The results demonstrate that the normalizing flow can reasonably infer the source parameters of GWs even with unknown contamination. We find that the nature of the glitch itself is the only factor that can affect the rationality of the inferred results. With improvements to our model, we anticipate accelerating the localization of electromagnetic counterparts and providing priors for more accurate deglitching, thereby speeding up subsequent data processing procedures.</description>

      <title>Holographic drag force with translational symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to investigate how the drag force is affected by translational symmetry breaking (TSB), we utilize a holographic model in which the background metric remains translational symmetric while a graviton mass or other fields in the theory break this symmetry. We calculate analytically the drag force, considering an asymptotic $AdS_5$ in which parameter {\alpha} arises from TSB. This parameter can be intuitively understood as a measure of TSB strength and we anticipate that non-zero values of it will affect the drag force. In this asymptotic AdS5 background, we will demonstrate that a decrease in {\alpha} results in a reduction of the drag force. Moreover, we study the diffusion constant, which falls with increasing {\alpha}. It will eventually be shown that at lower values of {\alpha} or {\mu} (chemical potential), the transverse diffusion coefficient is larger than the longitudinal one, and the speed of the heavy quark has minimal impact on the ratio.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario in a type II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant (mirror AdS-dS transition) in the late universe at $z\sim1.7$, known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a promising scenario for alleviating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, in the absence of a fully predictive model, implementing this fit required conjecturing that the dynamics of the linear perturbations are governed by general relativity. Recent work embedding the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model with the Lagrangian of a type II minimally modified gravity known as VCDM has propelled $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to a fully predictive model, removing the uncertainty related to the aforementioned assumption; we call this new model $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM. In this work, we demonstrate that not only does $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM fit the data better than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the new model, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM, performs even better in alleviating cosmological tensions while also providing a better fit to the data, including CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, and cosmic shear measurements. Our findings highlight the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework, particularly the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM model, as a compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, especially by successfully alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Additionally, these models predict higher values for $\sigma_8$, indicating enhanced structuring, albeit with lower present-day matter density parameter values and consequently reduced $S_8$ values, alleviating the $S_8$ tension as well. This demonstrates that the data are well fit by a combination of background and linear perturbations, both having dynamics differing from those of $\Lambda$CDM. This paves the way for further exploration of new ways for embedding the sign-switching cosmological constant into other models.</description>

      <title>$\omega$ meson from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many excited states in the hadron spectrum have large branching ratios to three-hadron final states. Understanding such particles from first principles QCD requires input from lattice QCD with one-, two-, and three-meson interpolators as well as a reliable three-body formalism relating finite-volume spectra at unphysical pion mass values to the scattering amplitudes at the physical point. In this work, we provide the first-ever calculation of the resonance parameters of the $\omega$ meson from lattice QCD, including an update of the formalism through matching to effective field theories. The main result of this pioneering study, the pole position of the $\omega$ meson at $\sqrt{s_\omega}= (778.0(11.2)-i\,3.0(5) )\,\mathrm{MeV}$, agrees reasonably well with experiment. In addition we provide an estimate of the $\omega-\rho$ mass difference as $29(15)\,\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Global Bases for Nonplanar Loop Integrands, Generalized Unitarity, and the Double Copy to All Loop Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method for defining a global loop-integrand basis for scattering amplitudes, encompassing both planar and nonplanar contributions. Our approach utilizes a graph-based framework to establish a well-defined, non-redundant basis of integrands. This basis, constructed from a chosen set of non-redundant graphs together with a selection of irreducible scalar products, provides clear insights into various physical properties of scattering amplitudes and proves useful in multiple contexts, such as on-shell Ward identities and manifesting gauge-choice independence. A key advantage of our integrand basis is its ability to streamline the generalized unitarity method. Specifically, we can directly read off the coefficients of basis elements without resorting to ansatze or solving linear equations. This novel approach allows us to lift generalized unitarity cuts -- expressed as products of tree amplitudes -- to loop-level integrands, facilitating the use of the tree-level double copy to generate complete gravitational integrands at any loop order. This method circumvents the difficulties in identifying complete higher-loop-order gauge-theory integrands that adhere to the color-kinematics duality. Additionally, our cut-based organization is well-suited for expansion in hard or soft limits, aiding in the exploration of ultraviolet or classical limits of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Holographic thermodynamic relation for dissipative and non-dissipative universes in a flat FLRW cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To clarify a holographic modified thermodynamic relation, the present study applies a general formulation for cosmological equations in a flat FLRW universe to the first law of thermodynamics, using the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_{\rm{BH}}$ and a dynamical Kodama-Hayward temperature $T_{\rm{KH}}$. For the general formulation, both an effective pressure $p_{e}$ of cosmological fluids for dissipative universes (e.g., bulk viscous cosmology) and an extra driving term $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ for non-dissipative universes (e.g., time-varying $\Lambda (t)$ cosmology) are phenomenologically assumed. When $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ is constant, the modified thermodynamic relation is equivalent to the formulation of the first law in standard cosmology. One side of this modified relation describes thermodynamic quantities in the bulk and can be divided into two time-derivative terms, namely $\dot{\rho}$ and $\dot{V}$ terms, where $\rho$ is the mass density of cosmological fluids and $V$ is the Hubble volume. Using the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm{GH}}$, the other side of this relation, $T_{\rm{KH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$, can be formulated as the sum of $T_{\rm{GH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$ and $[(T_{\rm{KH}}/T_{\rm{GH}}) -1] T_{\rm{GH}} \dot{S}_{\rm{BH}}$, which are equivalent to the $\dot{\rho}$ and $\dot{V}$ terms, respectively, with the magnitude of the $\dot{V}$ term being proportional to the square of the $\dot{\rho}$ term. In addition, the modified thermodynamic relation for constant $f_{\Lambda}(t)$ is examined by applying the equipartition law of energy on the horizon. This modified thermodynamic relation reduces to a kind of extended holographic-like connection when a constant $T_{\rm{KH}}$ universe is considered. The evolution of thermodynamic quantities is also discussed, using a constant $T_{\rm{KH}}$ model, extending a previous analysis [Phys. Rev. D 108, 083515 (2023) (arXiv:2306.11285)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variety of high-energy events can take place in the seconds leading up to a binary neutron-star merger. Mechanisms involving tidal resonances, electrodynamic interactions, or shocks in mass-loaded wakes have been proposed as instigators of these precursors. With a view of gravitational-wave and multimessenger astrophysics more broadly, premerger observations and theory are reviewed emphasising how gamma-ray precursors and dynamical tides can constrain the neutron-star equation of state, thermodynamic microphysics, and evolutionary pathways. Connections to post-merger phenomena, notably gamma-ray bursts, are discussed together with how magnetic fields, spin and misalignment, crustal elasticity, and stratification gradients impact observables.</description>

      <title>Magnetogenesis from axion-SU(2) inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel proposal for inflationary magnetogenesis by identifying the non-Abelian sector of Spectator Chromo Natural Inflation (SCNI) with the $\rm{SU(2)}_{\rm L}$ sector of the Standard Model. This mechanism relies on the recently discovered attractor of SCNI in the strong backreaction regime, where the gauge fields do not decay on super-horizon scales and their backreaction leads to a stable new trajectory for the rolling axion field. The large super-horizon gauge fields are partly transformed after the electroweak phase transition into electromagnetic fields. The strength and correlation length of the resulting helical magnetic fields depend on the inflationary Hubble scale and the details of the SCNI sector. For suitable parameter choices we show that the strength of the resulting magnetic fields having correlation lengths around $1\, {\rm {Mpc}}$ are consistent with the required intergalactic magnetic fields for explaining the spectra of high energy $\gamma$ rays from distant blazars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed through the gravitational collapse of cosmological perturbations that were generated and stretched during the inflationary era, later entering the cosmological horizon during the decelerating phase, if their amplitudes were sufficiently large. In this article, we will briefly introduce the basic concept of PBHs and review the formation dynamics through this mechanism, the estimation of the initial spins of PBHs and the time evolution of type II fluctuations, with a focus on the radiation-dominated and (early) matter-dominated phases.</description>

      <title>Mixed Warm Dark Matter Constraints using Milky Way Satellite Galaxy Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warm dark matter has been strongly constrained in recent years as the sole component of dark matter. However, a less-explored alternative is that dark matter consists of a mixture of warm and cold dark matter (MWDM). In this work, we use observations of Milky Way satellite galaxies to constrain MWDM scenarios where the formation of small-scale structure is suppressed either by generic thermal relic warm dark matter or a sterile neutrino produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism. To achieve this, we model satellite galaxies by combining numerical simulations with semi-analytical models for the subhalo population, and use a galaxy--halo connection model to match galaxies onto dark matter subhalos. By comparing the number of satellites predicted by MWDM models to the observed satellite population from the Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1, we constrain the fraction of warm dark matter, $f_{\rm WDM}$, as a function of its mass, $m_{\rm WDM}$. We exclude dark matter being composed entirely of thermal relic warm dark matter with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 6.6 $ keV at a posterior ratio of 10:1, consistent with previous works. However, we find that warm dark matter with smaller mass is allowed when mixed with cold dark matter, and that the $f_{\rm WDM}$ constraints strengthen with decreasing $m_{\rm WDM}$ until they plateau at $f_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 0.45 $ for $m_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 1.5$ keV. Likewise, in the case of a sterile neutrino with mass of 7 keV produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism, we exclude a fraction of $f_{\nu_s} \lesssim 0.45$, independent of mixing angle. Our results extend constraints on MWDM to a region of parameter space that has been relatively unconstrained with previous analysis.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework for Characterizing Spacetime Microstructure with Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of physics at the Planck scale has garnered significant attention due to its implications for understanding the fundamental nature of the universe. At the Planck scale, quantum fluctuations challenge the classical notion of spacetime as a smooth continuum, revealing a complex microstructure that defies traditional models. This study introduces a novel scaling-based framework to investigate the properties of spacetime microstructures. By deriving a scaling-characterized metric tensor and reformulating fundamental equations--including the geodesic, Einstein field, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equation--into scaling forms, the research reveals new properties of local spacetime dynamics. Remarkably, the golden ratio emerges naturally in linear scale measurements, offering a potential explanation for the role of the Planck length in resolving ultraviolet (UV) divergence. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how scale invariance in spacetime can restore classical geometric stability through the renormalization group equations. These findings significantly revise classical geometric intuitions, providing a fresh lens for understanding quantum fluctuations and offering promising insights for advancing quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic \textit{ab initio} study of the low-lying states in beryllium isotopes from $^7\text{Be}$ to $^{12}\text{Be}$ using nuclear lattice effective field theory with the N$^3$LO interaction. Our calculations achieve excellent agreement with experimental data for energies, radii, and electromagnetic properties. We introduce a novel, model-independent method to quantify nuclear shapes, uncovering a distinct pattern in the interplay between positive and negative parity states across the isotopic chain. Our geometrical analysis reveals prominent two-center cluster structures, the emergence of one-neutron halo, and complex nuclear molecular dynamics, underscoring the strong clustering features inherent to beryllium isotopes.</description>
