      <title>Biomolecular crystallization in microfluidic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter presents an overview of microfluidic devices reported in the literature, used to develop methodologies for nucleation of biomolecules, with crystal size control, and for collecting thermodynamic and kinetic data. Part I is dedicated to the properties of microfluidic devices through materials used for their fabrication and for crystals analysis. Part II describes the variety of microfluidic devices available and how to handle them to produce flows, droplets and/or wells of micrometer size. These devices use crystallization methods inspired by batch processes and they are mainly used for protein crystallization. Part III focuses on fundamental properties of biomolecule crystallization determined using droplet-based microfluidics: nucleation kinetics, nucleation rate and effective interfacial energy crystal/solution. Part IV explains how the kinetic effect of confinement due to micrometer size, and so nanovolumes, leads to isolation of different phases. These latter are characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and methods to minimize manual handling of crystals for XRD are also presented, with appropriate equipment to store the crystals.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the full potential of jumping condensation on microstructured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces can generate spontaneous droplet jumping, enabling rapid condensate removal and improved thermal and mass transfer. Although this effect has been extensively demonstrated on densely packed nanostructures, the capability of microscale textures to support jumping condensation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that engineered microscale conical arrays can achieve efficient microdroplet jumping and reveal a previously unreported spacing-dependent critical transition between jumping and non-jumping regimes. In the jumping regime, by varying only the cone pitch, we identify a geometric threshold below which sub-10 micron droplets are rapidly removed, and above which jumping is suppressed, resulting in slower dynamics and larger departing droplets. In situ optical and environmental scanning electron microscopies reveal the mechanistic origin of this transition: dense arrays favour full Cassie droplets, which depart cleanly, while wider spacing favours partial Cassie droplets that retain a localized wet region initiating new nucleation. From these results, we construct a geometry-wetting design map linking microstructure spacing, droplet morphology, and nucleation density. These findings establish design principles for scalable, mechanically robust microstructured surfaces capable of high-performance condensation management for anti-fogging, water harvesting, and heat-transfer applications.</description>

      <title>Understanding Structural Representation in Foundation Models for Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the relative scarcity of training data to the lack of standardized benchmarks, the development of foundation models for polymers face significant and multi-faceted challenges. At the core, many of these issues are tied directly to the structural representation of polymers and here, we present a new foundation model using a SMILES-based polymer graph representation. This approach allows representation of critical polymer architectural features and connectivity that are not available in other SMILES-based representations. The developed polymer foundation model exhibited excellent performance on 28 different benchmark datasets. Critical evaluation of the developed representation against other variations in control experiments reveals this approach to be a highly performant method of representing polymers in language-based foundation models. These control experiments also reveal a strong invariance of all SMILES representations, with many variations achieving state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance, including those which are chemically or semantically invalid. Examination of error sources and attention maps for the evaluated representations corroborate the findings of the control experiments, showing that chemistry language models based on SMILES interpolate over all sequence space for prediction tasks, not only those of semantically valid inputs. Overall, this work highlights the importance of control experiments as a check on human-imposed assumptions that can limit rational design of both chemistry foundation models and their underlying structural representations.</description>

      <title>Soft-Lubrication Drainage and Rupture in Particle-Driven Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deformation and rupture of a lipid vesicle due to the forced normal approach of an inclusion are essential for optimizing the design of magnetic giant unilamellar vesicles [magGUVs, Malik et al., Nanoscale 17, 13720 (2025)], with implications for active colloid-membrane interactions and cellular-scale chemical delivery. Here, we investigate vesicles propelled by a force-driven rigid inclusion and reveal a robust elastohydrodynamic mechanism: the inclusion outpaces the vesicle, sustaining a thinning film that drains symmetrically and self-similarly, largely independent of initial shape. For soft membranes and small inclusions, coupling drives a monotonic tension increase that can exceed the lysis tension. Evaluating the maximal tension over a delivery distance, we map an operating window in vesicle reduced area and size relative to the inclusion.</description>

      <title>Soft Colloidal Robots: Magnetically Guided Liquid Crystal Torons for Targeted Micro-Cargo Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticles in liquid crystals, such as torons and skyrmions, represent a new class of topologically protected solitonic excitations, offering a promising route toward soft microrobotics. Here we demonstrate that torons can be propelled by modulated electric fields and magnetically steered with full directional control, thus achieving programmable trajectories without net liquid flow. Within microfluidic architectures, we guide ensembles of torons through confined channels and realize targeted pick-up, transport, and release of colloidal cargo. By combining experiments and numerical simulations, we uncover how magnetic alignment reshapes toron structure, speed, and stability, while confinement within microchannels gives rise to novel transport regimes. Unlike conventional colloidal inclusions, torons are intrinsically uniform, soft, and reconfigurable, establishing them as both an ideal model system for studying emergent phenomena in active topological matter and a versatile platform for next-generation soft robots, adaptive delivery systems, and smart active matter.</description>

      <title>Morphogenesis of bacterial colonies in liquid crystalline environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural bacterial habitats are often complex fluids with viscoelastic and anisotropic responses to stress; for example, they can take the form of liquid crystals (LCs), with elongated microscopic constituents that collectively align while still retaining the ability to flow. However, laboratory studies typically focus on cells in simple liquids or complex fluids with randomly-oriented constituents. Here, we show how interactions with LCs shape bacterial proliferation in multicellular colonies. Using experiments, we find that in a nematic LC, cells generically form aligned single-cell-wide "chains" as they reproduce. As these chains lengthen, they eventually buckle in a highly localized manner. By combining our measurements with a continuum mechanical theory, we demonstrate that this distinctive morphogenetic program emerges because cells are kept in alignment due to the LC's elasticity; as each chain lengthens, growth-induced viscous stresses along its contour eventually overcome the elasticity of the surrounding nematic, leading to buckling. Our work thus reveals and provides mechanistic insight into the previously-overlooked role of LCs in sculpting bacterial life in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the energy landscape of the logarithmic potential: local minima and stationary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a detailed exploration of the energy landscape for configurations of points on the sphere, interacting via the logarithmic potential, and corresponding to local minima of the total energy, up to $N = 160$. The growth of $N_{\rm conf}$ (number of distinct configurations) is exponential, as for the Thomson problem, although weaker. Using the techniques described in our previous paper~\cite{Amore25} we have also explored the solution landscape of this problem for $N \leq 24$, and found that the number of stationary states is growing exponentially.</description>

      <title>Field-Particle Interactions in Curved Flows for Shape-Asymmetric Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that curvatures in general ambient flow profiles can align shape-asymmetric active particles, revealing a previously overlooked competition with externally applied aligning fields. Focusing on the ubiquitous case of channel flows, we then investigate the fundamental consequences of this competition for the dynamics of shape-asymmetric active particles in microchannels in the presence of orienting fields. We find that this interplay gives rise to novel mechanisms for controlling particle dynamics, with potentially broad applications, and suggests exciting possibilities such as active-particle analogs of electronic systems.</description>

      <title>A constitutive framework for tension-compression failure asymmetry in soft materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft materials often exhibit pronounced tension-compression asymmetry (TCA) in their softening and failure behavior, a feature that conventional hyperelastic and continuum-damage formulations fail to capture within a unified framework. This work presents a Lode-invariant-based hyperelastic softening model that explicitly incorporates deformation-mode dependence through a bi-failure construction with distinct tensile and compressive energy limiters. The proposed model extends Volokh's classical energy-limiting approach by embedding a Lode-angle-dependent weighting function, which ensures a smooth and thermodynamically consistent transition of failure behavior across distortion modes, achieved directly within the constitutive description of the bulk response, without introducing internal damage variables. Agarose hydrogels (1, 2, and 3% w/v) serve as the model system for validation. The framework accurately reproduces experimental stress-stretch responses in uniaxial tension and compression, capturing concentration-dependent stiffness and failure energetics. Using parameters calibrated solely from combined uniaxial data, the model predicts pure shear behavior, including softening and failure, demonstrating strong cross-mode generalizability. To further assess thermodynamic stability and deformation-mode sensitivity, the model's energy landscape was analyzed across the Lode-invariant space, confirming stable behavior under diverse loading conditions. Parameter evolution with concentration follows power-law scaling, enabling interpolation and predictive validation at intermediate concentrations (2.5% w/v). By establishing a physically interpretable damage framework over the Lode invariant space, this work provides a unified framework for tension-compression-asymmetric softening and lays the foundation for distortional-mode-sensitive, three-dimensional failure mapping of soft materials.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to predicting plasticity in disordered solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that vortex-like topological defects with negative winding number in the vibrational modes of a two-dimensional glass under quasistatic shear correlate strongly with plastic events, offering a promising route to predict them. However, many of these vortices, a number that actually grows quadratically with mode frequency, are entirely unrelated to plasticity and arise simply from the underlying plane-wave structure of the modes. This raises doubts about the fundamental relevance of such defects to plastic rearrangements and limits their predictive power. Here, we introduce a geometrical filter based on the Nye dislocation density that, when applied to the vibrational modes, removes these spurious defects and reveals the true plastic precursors. Using simulations of a two-dimensional model glass, we show that this filtered approach consistently outperforms the conventional vortex-based method, particularly at small strains and when focusing on genuine plastic stress drops, offering a more robust tool to predicting plasticity in glasses from their undeformed initial state.</description>

      <title>Transmembrane transport of polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles into giant vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles have significant application value in fields such as gene therapy and targeted drug delivery. A profound understanding of the interaction mechanisms between these particles and cell membranes represents a critical scientific challenge in biophysics. Using the Self-Consistent Field Theory, this work systematically explores the transmembrane transport of polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles into giant vesicles. The impacts of critical parameters-polymer brush grafting density, nanoparticle size, and giant vesicle membrane thickness-on transport behavior are comprehensively elucidated. The findings reveal two distinct transmembrane transport mechanisms for polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles, which are governed by membrane thickness and grafting density. At high grafting density, the nanoparticles undergo direct transmembrane translocation; at low grafting density, transport occurs via endocytosis. Thermodynamic analysis identifies entropy as the dominant driving force for this process.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of a Fluctuation-Induced Dynamical Crossover in Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field theories of the glass transition predict a phase transition to a dynamically arrested state, yet no such transition is observed in experiments or simulations of finite-dimensional systems. We resolve this long-standing discrepancy by incorporating critical dynamical fluctuations into a microscopic mode-coupling framework. We show that these fluctuations round off the mean-field singularity and restore ergodicity at all finite densities (or temperatures) without invoking activated dynamics or facilitation. The resulting effective theory describes the order parameter as a stochastic process with self-induced, annealed disorder, determined self-consistently at the mean-field level. In the $\beta$-relaxation regime it reduces to stochastic beta-relaxation theory, thereby unifying mode-coupling and replica-based approaches beyond mean-field. All parameters of the stochastic $\beta$-relaxation theory are fixed by the static structure, enabling parameter-free predictions that extend mean-field theory into finite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Vertex Model Mechanics Explain the Emergence of Centroidal Voronoi Tiling in Epithelia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epithelia are confluent cell layers that self-organize into polygonal networks whose geometry encodes their mechanical state. A principal driver is the tunable contractility of the actomyosin cortex, which links cell-junction tension to tissue architecture. Notably, epithelial tilings frequently resemble centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs), yet the physical origin of this resemblance has remained unclear. Here, using a minimal vertex model that relates cell shape to a mechanical energy, we show that CVT-like patterns arise naturally in the solid (rigid) regime of tissues. Analytical theory reveals that isotropic strain minimization drives cell centroids toward Voronoi configurations, a result we corroborate with a analytical mean-field formulation of the vertex model. We further demonstrate that physiologically relevant perturbations -- such as cyclic stretch -- shift tissues into distinct, geometrically disordered CVT states, and that these shifts provide quantitative, image-based readouts of mechanical state. Together, our results identify a mechanical origin for CVT-like organization in epithelia and establish a geometric framework that infers tissue stresses directly from morphology, offering broadly applicable metrics for assessing rigidity and remodeling in living tissues.</description>

      <title>Inferring intraciliary dynamics from the gliding motility of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is widely recognized as a premier model living microswimmer for physicists and biophysicists. However, the interest around C. reinhardtii goes beyond its swimming capabilities. In fact, light can drastically alter its behavior: under blue illumination, the cell attaches to a nearby surface and intermittently glides on it. Such a gliding motility is powered by molecular-motor proteins operating on the cell's cilia, and the related machinery has established the cell as a prime reference for the study of intraciliary-transport mechanisms. This is what we focus on in the present work, by combining in-line holographic microscopy -which leads to unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions on the gliding dynamics -and statistical inference. We show that, while gliding, the cells exhibit anomalous-diffusive features, including Lorentzian-like distributions of displacements, which are reminiscent of enhanced search strategies. The latter may be exploited by the cells to facilitate colony formation, or, more broadly, by organisms possessing an intraciliary-transport machinery for the transport of cargo molecules and signaling. Furthermore, gliding trajectories, by being intermittent, are valid candidates to infer forces at the molecular-motor scale that are necessary for the cells to move, or symetrically, to transport cargo molecules. We report a gliding threshold of about 20 pN, compatible with the activity of single molecular motors.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled filament layers in drying sessile droplets: from morphology to electrical conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the deposition of filaments, such as nanowires and nanotubes, from evaporating droplets is critical for the performance of emerging technologies like flexible sensors and printed electronics. The final deposit morphology strongly governs functional properties, such as electrical conductivity, yet remains challenging to control. In this work, we numerically investigate how filament length, stiffness, and concentration affect deposition patterns during the drying process. We compare reaction-limited and diffusion-limited evaporation regimes, demonstrating that their distinct velocity fields and flow magnitudes fundamentally alter filament arrangement. While diffusion-limited evaporation drives the ``coffee-ring effect", compromising network uniformity, reaction-limited evaporation suppresses edge accumulation, promoting centered conductive deposits. We map out the spatial variation of filament alignment - tangential at the contact line, radial in the intermediate region, and random near the center. Longer filaments tend to favour more tangential alignment overall and suppress edge accumulation. We find that by tuning the evaporation regime, filament deposition can lead to significantly lower percolation thresholds and significantly higher conductivity exponents. These results quantify the link between evaporation kinetics and microstructure, providing guidelines for optimizing conductive network formation in printed electronics.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws and Universal Features of Tethered Polymer Distributions in Confined Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified scaling framework for the end-position distributions of tethered polymers confined in finite cylindrical geometries. Two observables are analysed: the longitudinal distribution P(x), along the confinement axis, and the transverse distribution P(y), perpendicular to the confinement axis. Using exact Fourier-sine and image-method representations with adaptive numerical schemes, we construct and test six scaling strategies for P(x) and five for P(y), encompassing geometric similarity, tether-position sweeps, confinement-strength crossovers, persistence-length effects, boundary-layer scaling near absorbing walls, and tether-centered coil scaling. Quantitative collapse diagnostics such as RMS residuals on common support, modal-energy fractions, and survival probabilities are combined with limiting-regime analysis and direct numerical evaluation to distinguish genuine universality from visually misleading overlap.
  From these tests we obtain a kappa-based confinement diagram and a two-parameter (kappa, a/L) regime map that link classical theories such as Flory/de Gennes blobs, Odijk deflection segments, and wormlike-chain behaviour within a single spectral picture. Gaussian, multimode, and eigenmode-dominated regimes are identified by explicit thresholds in modal composition and collapse error, providing operational criteria for when Gaussian or single-mode descriptions are valid and when full multimode structure is required. The resulting framework provides a compact, reproducible toolkit for analysing confined-polymer statistics, with applications to simulations and experiments on DNA, chromatin, and other biopolymers where confinement, stiffness, and tethering jointly control spatial organization.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoretic migration of colloidal particles in sucrose gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusiophoresis (DP) refers to the migration of particles driven by a solute concentration gradient in a liquid. Observations in the case of molecular neutral solutes are rather scarce, due to the low drift velocities in dilute solutions, and the difficulty in distinguishing DP from other phenomena in concentrated solutions. We investigated experimentally DP of dispersed colloids driven by concentration gradients of sucrose in water at relatively high concentrations, $C \simeq 1$ mol L$^{-1}$. More precisely, we designed a microfluidic chip to impose a time-dependent sucrose gradient in dead-end microchannels with minimized parasitic flows. Significant migration of the particles toward the regions of low sucrose concentration has been observed, with velocities up to a few $\mu$m s$^{-1}$. Particle tracking and Raman confocal spectroscopy were used to measure individual trajectories and the unsteady sucrose concentration profile respectively. The latter is correctly described by a diffusion equation, but with an interdiffusion coefficient that significantly depends on $C$ in the range of concentrations investigated. We then showed that a model of DP based on a steric exclusion of sucrose molecules from the particle surface with an exclusion length $R_i = 5 \pm 0.9$ angstrom (close to the characteristic size of the sucrose molecule), accounts for the observed trajectories. Possible sources for the observed scattering of our experimental data are finally discussed: Brownian motion and advection of the particles by bulk flows driven by diffusioosmosis at the channel walls and buoyancy.</description>

      <title>Towards Animate Droplets: Active, Adaptive, and Autonomous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets, sub-millilitre liquid volumes with at least one interface, have traditionally served as compartments for storing, transporting, and delivering materials. Beyond familiar applications in food, coatings, and consumer goods, they find cutting-edge use in energy storage, sensing, and tissue engineering. The next frontier is their integration into animate matter, emerging materials defined by their levels of activity, adaptiveness, and autonomy. Easy to produce and dispense or print into complex structures, and with enormous chemical versatility, droplets are ideal building blocks for animate matter. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for advancing animacy in droplets and call for a more concerted effort to integrate novel mechanisms for motility, sensing, and decision-making into droplet design. Although research on active droplets spans more than a century, achieving true autonomy, where droplets process multiple stimuli and respond without external control, remains a central challenge. We hope to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration towards applications in consumer goods, microfluidics, adaptive optics, tissue engineering, and soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Kovacs-like memory effect in strain stiffening collagen networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials driven far from equilibrium can encode memories of past deformations through long-lived structural reorganisations. Such memory effects-reflecting parameters such as deformation direction, magnitude, and duration have been widely explored in soft amorphous solids. Here, we report a Kovacs-like memory effect manifested as a non-monotonic stress relaxation in vitro biopolymer networks formed by collagen, an essential component of the mammalian extracellular matrix. Using shear rheology combined with in-situ optical imaging, we find that this memory effect emerges exclusively in the nonlinear strain-stiffening regime, and persists over a much broader range of strain amplitudes than previously reported for other viscoelastic amorphous materials. Furthermore, we uncover a strong correlation between the memory response and the development of negative normal stresses and associated strain fields, highlighting the unique nonequilibrium mechanics underlying memory formation in biopolymer networks.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation Beyond Turing: Physical Principles of Mass-Conserving Reaction--Diffusion Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracellular protein patterns govern essential cellular functions by dynamically redistributing proteins between membrane-bound and cytosolic states, conserving their total numbers. This review presents a theoretical framework for understanding such patterns based on mass-conserving reaction--diffusion systems. The emergence, selection, and evolution of patterns are analyzed in terms of mass redistribution and interface motion, resulting in mesoscale laws of coarsening and wavelength selection. A geometric phase-space perspective provides a conceptual tool to link local reactive equilibria with global pattern dynamics through conserved mass fluxes. The Min protein system of \emph{Escherichia coli} provides a paradigmatic example, enabling direct comparison between theory and experiment. Successive model refinements capture both the robustness of pattern formation and the diversity of dynamic regimes observed \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro}. The Min system thus illustrates how to extract predictive, multiscale theory from biochemical detail, providing a foundation for understanding pattern formation in more complex and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of the $\beta$-Relaxation Beyond Mode-Coupling Theory: A Microscopic Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic extension of mode-coupling theory (MCT) that incorporates critical dynamical fluctuations. Starting from a microscopic diagrammatic theory, we identify dominant classes of divergent diagrams near the mode-coupling transition and show that the corresponding asymptotic series dominates the mean-field below an upper critical dimension $d_c=8$. To resum these divergences, we construct a mapping to a stochastic dynamical process in which the order parameter evolves under random spatiotemporal fields. This reformulation provides a controlled, fully dynamical derivation of an effective theory for the $\beta$-relaxation which remarkably coincides with stochastic beta-relaxation theory [T. Rizzo, EPL 106, 56003 (2014)]. All coupling constants of the latter theory are expressed microscopically in terms of the liquid static structure factor and are computed for the paradigmatic hard-sphere system. The analysis demonstrates that fluctuations alone restore ergodicity and replace the putative mean-field transition by a smooth crossover. Our results establish a predictive framework for structural relaxation beyond mean-field.</description>

      <title>Flow topology classification of limit cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent topological tools offer a powerful way to classify how phases of nonlinear bosonic resonators are organized. Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Near surface concentration profile of sheared semi-dilute polymer solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the structure of polymer solutions near a solid surface is crucial for many industrial processes, as it significantly impacts solution flow and influences slip at the interface. To date, only a few techniques have been developed to experimentally investigate this type of interface at the nanometric scale of solid/liquid interaction. In this study, we probe the interface between a smooth sapphire surface and a semi-diluted polystyrene solution, using neutron reflectivity. A special setup for flow measurements under shear has been designed and optimized. Our results show that, at rest, polymer chains are globally depleted from the solid surface. Contrary to common assumptions, some polystyrene chains do adsorb onto the wall. Under flow conditions, we experimentally demonstrate that the depletion layer remains stable, a finding that has been hypothesized but only vaguely confirmed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Work and Activation in a Nematic Polymer Network Ribbon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spontaneous deformations of a ribbon made of nematic polymer networks and activated under the action of a mechanical load. We show that when such ribbons are activated appropriately, the deformations produced can pull back and perform work against the externally applied load. We perform two numerical experiments to demonstrate this effect: (1) the \emph{pulling} experiment, where the ribbon is pulled longitudinally by a point force, and (2) the \emph{bending} experiment, where the ribbon is bent out of plane by a terminally applied point force. We quantify the capacity of the ribbon to work against external loads, and compute its dependence on both the ribbon thickness and the imprinted nematic texture (that is, the distribution of the nematic directors across the ribbon's length). Finally, we compute the efficiency of the activation process. Building on the outcomes of our numerical explorations, we formulate two educated conjectures on how the activation efficiency can in general be improved by acting on both the applied load and the imprinted nematic texture.</description>

      <title>Dual effect of cholesterol on interfacial water dynamics in lipid membranes: Interplay between membrane packing and hydration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water contained within biological membranes plays a critical role in maintaining the separation between intracellular and extracellular environments and facilitating biochemical processes. Variations in membrane composition and temperature lead to phase state changes in lipid membranes, which in turn influence the structure and dynamics of the associated interfacial water. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on binary membranes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM) mixed with cholesterol (Chol). To elucidate the effects of Chol on interfacial water, we examined the orientation and hydrogen-bonding behavior of water molecules spanning from the membrane interior to the interface. As the Chol concentration increased, a transient slow down in water dynamics was observed in the ripple phase at 303 K. Conversely, at higher Chol concentrations, water dynamics were accelerated relative to pure lipid membranes across all temperatures studied. Specifically, at a Chol concentration of 50%, the hydrogen bond lifetime in DPPC membranes decreased to approximately 0.5-0.7 times that of pure lipid membranes. This nonmonotonic behavior is attributed to the combined effects of membrane packing induced by Chol and a reduced density of lipid molecules in the hydrophilic region, offering key insights for modulating the dynamical properties of interfacial water.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. As a confluent epithelial layer becomes progressively more jammed, two interpenetrating networks emerge: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells percolating within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of the compression network was found to be susceptible to both specific molecular stimulus and to injury-induced unjamming. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that was well-captured by preferential network theory. Together, these findings demonstrate the existence of a network-based inhibition of proliferation (NIP) that is self-organizing and poised in proximity to criticality.</description>
