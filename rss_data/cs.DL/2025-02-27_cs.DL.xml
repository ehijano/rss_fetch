      <title>Sustaining Knowledge Infrastructures: Asking Questions and Listening for Answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustaining knowledge infrastructures (KIs) remains a persistent issue that requires continued engagement from diverse stakeholders. This is due to the complexity of KIs and sustainability, as well as to new questions and values that are arising in relation to KI maintenance. In this commentary, we draw on existing literature and our experiences at a workshop for researchers exploring KI evaluation to pose five directions of thinking which are especially relevant for KI project managers to consider when thinking about how to make their KIs stand the test of time.</description>

      <title>Behavioural Predictors that Influence Digital Legacy Management Intentions among Individuals in South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An emerging phenomenon, digital legacy management explores the management of digital data individuals accumulate throughout their lifetime. With the integration of digital systems and data into people's daily lives, it becomes crucial to understand the intricacies of managing data to eventually form one's digital legacy. This can be understood by investigating the significance of behavioral predictors in shaping digital legacy management.
  The objective of this study is to explore how behavioral predictors influence the intentions of individuals in South Africa towards managing their digital legacy. This entailed:
  Investigating the impact of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on these intentions. Exploring the perceived usefulness of digital legacy management systems. Understanding the implications of response cost and task-technology fit on individuals' inclinations towards digital legacy planning. Data were collected (n = 203 valid responses) from South African residents using an online survey and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation analysis (PLS-SEM). Results indicate that attitudes, peer opinions, personal resources, and skills are significant positive influences on digital legacy management intention. Recognizing and understanding these behavioral predictors is key when developing region-specific and culturally sensitive digital legacy management tools, awareness campaigns, and policies. Furthermore, it could pave the way for more tailored strategies, ensuring effective transfer of post-mortem data, reducing potential conflicts, and providing clarity when dealing with post-mortem data.</description>

      <title>BatteryLife: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Battery Life Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery Life Prediction (BLP), which relies on time series data produced by battery degradation tests, is crucial for battery utilization, optimization, and production. Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.4 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 80 chemical systems, 12 operating temperatures, and 646 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in a series of neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains. BatteryLife is available at https://github.com/Ruifeng-Tan/BatteryLife.</description>

      <title>Sampling nodes and hyperedges via random walks on large hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a fundamental framework for representing complex systems involving interactions among three or more entities. As empirical hypergraphs grow in size, characterizing their structural properties becomes increasingly challenging due to computational complexity and, in some cases, restricted access to complete data, requiring efficient sampling methods. Random walks offer a practical approach to hypergraph sampling, as they rely solely on local neighborhood information from nodes and hyperedges. In this study, we investigate methods for simultaneously sampling nodes and hyperedges via random walks on large hypergraphs. First, we compare three existing random walks in the context of hypergraph sampling and identify an advantage of the so-called higher-order random walk. Second, by extending an established technique for graphs to the case of hypergraphs, we present a non-backtracking variant of the higher-order random walk. We derive theoretical results on estimators based on the non-backtracking higher-order random walk and validate them through numerical simulations on large empirical hypergraphs. Third, we apply the non-backtracking higher-order random walk to a large hypergraph of co-authorships indexed in the OpenAlex database, where full access to the data is not readily available. Despite the relatively small sample size, our estimates largely align with previous findings on author productivity, team size, and the prevalence of open-access publications. Our findings contribute to the development of analysis methods for large hypergraphs, offering insights into sampling strategies and estimation techniques applicable to real-world complex systems.</description>

      <title>ZuantuSet: A Collection of Historical Chinese Visualizations and Illustrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historical visualizations are a valuable resource for studying the history of visualization and inspecting the cultural context where they were created. When investigating historical visualizations, it is essential to consider contributions from different cultural frameworks to gain a comprehensive understanding. While there is extensive research on historical visualizations within the European cultural framework, this work shifts the focus to ancient China, a cultural context that remains underexplored by visualization researchers. To this aim, we propose a semi-automatic pipeline to collect, extract, and label historical Chinese visualizations. Through the pipeline, we curate ZuantuSet, a dataset with over 71K visualizations and 108K illustrations. We analyze distinctive design patterns of historical Chinese visualizations and their potential causes within the context of Chinese history and culture. We illustrate potential usage scenarios for this dataset, summarize the unique challenges and solutions associated with collecting historical Chinese visualizations, and outline future research directions.</description>

      <title>Towards a Knowledge Graph for Models and Algorithms in Applied Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematical models and algorithms are an essential part of mathematical research data, as they are epistemically grounding numerical data. In order to represent models and algorithms as well as their relationship semantically to make this research data FAIR, two previously distinct ontologies were merged and extended, becoming a living knowledge graph. The link between the two ontologies is established by introducing computational tasks, as they occur in modeling, corresponding to algorithmic tasks. Moreover, controlled vocabularies are incorporated and a new class, distinguishing base quantities from specific use case quantities, was introduced. Also, both models and algorithms can now be enriched with metadata. Subject-specific metadata is particularly relevant here, such as the symmetry of a matrix or the linearity of a mathematical model. This is the only way to express specific workflows with concrete models and algorithms, as the feasible solution algorithm can only be determined if the mathematical properties of a model are known. We demonstrate this using two examples from different application areas of applied mathematics. In addition, we have already integrated over 250 research assets from applied mathematics into our knowledge graph.</description>

      <title>Automatic Detection of Research Values from Scientific Abstracts Across Computer Science Subfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of Computer science (CS) has rapidly evolved over the past few decades, providing computational tools and methodologies to various fields and forming new interdisciplinary communities. This growth in CS has significantly impacted institutional practices and relevant research communities. Therefore, it is crucial to explore what specific research values, known as basic and fundamental beliefs that guide or motivate research attitudes or actions, CS-related research communities promote. Prior research has manually analyzed research values from a small sample of machine learning papers. No prior work has studied the automatic detection of research values in CS from large-scale scientific texts across different research subfields. This paper introduces a detailed annotation scheme featuring ten research values that guide CS-related research. Based on the scheme, we build value classifiers to scale up the analysis and present a systematic study over 226,600 paper abstracts from 32 CS-related subfields and 86 popular publishing venues over ten years.</description>
