      <title>A filter-dependent granular temperature model from large-scale CFD-DEM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational study of strongly-coupled, gas-solid flows at scales relevant to most environmental and engineering applications requires the use of `coarse-grained' methodologies such as the two-fluid model, particle-in-cell approach or the multiphase Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. While these strategies enable computations at desirable length- and time-scales, they rely heavily on models to capture important flow physics that occur at scales smaller than the mesh. To date, the models that do exist are based on a limited set of flow conditions, such as very dilute particle phase. To this end, we leverage the most large-scale repository of CFD-DEM data to date to develop a filter-size dependent model for granular temperature -- a key quantity for accurately predicting gas-solid flows. This filter-size dependence then translates directly to grid-size dependence in the context of coarse-grained approaches. In addition, we leverage the CFD-DEM dataset to propose an improved model for the mean variance in particle volume fraction, a quantity that characterizes the degree of clustering in the flow.</description>

      <title>Optimized Designs for High-Efficiency Particle Sorting in Serpentine Microfluidic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient particle sorting in microfluidic systems is vital for advancements in biomedical diagnostics and industrial applications. This study numerically investigates particle migration and passive sorting in symmetric serpentine microchannels, leveraging inertial and centrifugal forces for label-free, high-throughput separation. Using a two-dimensional numerical model, particle dynamics were analyzed across varying flow rates, diameter ratios (1.2, 1.5, and 2), and channel configurations. The optimized serpentine geometry achieved particle separation efficiencies exceeding 95% and throughput greater than 99%.A novel scaling framework was developed to predict the minimum number of channel loops required for efficient sorting. Additionally, the robustness of the proposed scaling framework is demonstrated by its consistency with findings from previous studies, which exhibit the same trend as predicted by the scaling laws, underscoring the universality and reliability of the model. Additionally, the study revealed the significant influence of density ratio ({\alpha}) on sorting efficiency, where higher {\alpha} values enhanced separation through amplified hydrodynamic forces. Optimal flow rates tailored to particle sizes were identified, enabling the formation of focused particle streaks for precise sorting. However, efficiency declined beyond these thresholds due to particle entrapment in micro-vortices or boundary layers. This work provides valuable insights and design principles for developing compact, cost-effective microfluidic systems, with broad applications in biomedical fields like cell sorting and pathogen detection, as well as industrial processes requiring precise particle handlin</description>

      <title>Autonomous real-time control of turbulent dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mastering turbulence remains one of physics' most intractable challenges, with its chaotic, multi-scale dynamics driving energy dissipation across transport and energy systems. Here we report REACT (Reinforcement Learning for Environmental Adaptation and Control of Turbulence), a fully autonomous reinforcement learning framework that achieves real-time, adaptive, closed-loop turbulence control in real-world environments. Deployed on a road vehicle model equipped solely with onboard sensors and servo-actuated surfaces, REACT learns directly from sparse experimental measurements in a wind tunnel environment, bypassing intractable direct numerical simulations and empirical turbulence models. The agent autonomously converges to a policy that reduces aerodynamic drag while achieving net energy savings. Without prior knowledge of flow physics, it discovers that dynamically suppressing spatio-temporally coherent flow structures in the vehicle wake maximizes energy efficiency, achieving two to four times greater performance than model-based baseline controllers. Through a physics-informed training that recasts data in terms of dimensionless physical groups and parametric input spaces, REACT synthesizes offline a single generalizable agent that transfers across speeds without retraining. These results move agentic learning beyond simulation to robust, interpretable real-world control of high-Reynolds turbulence, opening a path to self-optimizing physical systems in transport, energy and environmental flows.</description>

      <title>Understanding the effect of wall elasticity in turbulent channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares turbulent channel flows over elastic walls with those over rough walls, to explore the role of the dynamic change of shape of the wall on turbulence. The comparison is made meaningful by generating rough walls from instantaneous configurations of the elastic cases. The aim of this comparison is to individually understand the role of fluid-structure interaction effects and the role of wall shape/undulations in determining the overall physics of flow near elastic walls. With an increase in the compliance of the wall, qualitatively similar trends for many of the effects produced by a rough wall are also seen in the elastic wall. However, specific features can be observed for the elastic wall cases only, arising from the mutual interaction between the solid and fluid, leading to a further increase in drag. To understand them, we look at the turbulent structures, which exhibit clear differences across the various configurations: roughness induces only a slight reduction of streamwise coherency, resulting in a situation qualitatively similar to what is found in classical turbulent channel flows, whereas elasticity causes the emergence of a novel dominant spanwise coherency. Additionally, we explored the effect of vertical disturbances on elastic wall dynamics by comparing with permeable walls having similar (average) wall-normal velocity fluctuations at the interface. The permeable walls were found to have minimal similarities with elastic walls. Overall, we can state that the wall motion caused by the complex fluid-structure interaction contributes significantly to the flow and must be considered when modeling it. In particular, we highlight the emergence of strong wall-normal fluctuations near the wall, which result in strong ejection events, an attribute not observed for rigid walls.</description>

      <title>Multi-Partitioned Meshfree Quantum Finite Particle Method: A Hybrid Quantum Framework for Fluid Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study established a quantum-classical hybrid framework that integrates quantum computing paradigm with meshfree finite particle method. By harnessing quantum superposition and entanglement, it hybridized the critical computational kernels (termed as quantum finite particle method). A resource-efficient quantum computational strategy on multi-partitioned zones was proposed, which leverages a fixed small-scale quantum circuit as a fundamental processing unit to handle inner product for arbitrarily sized arrays. This approach employs iterative nesting of the quantum-core operation to accommodate varying input dimensions while maintaining hardware feasibility throughout. Motivated with developed quantum framework, the novel numerical discretization for hybrid quantum computational particle dynamics can be derived commonly and applied in fluid flows. Through a sequence of numerical experiments purposefully, the proposed numerical model was thoroughly validated and analyzed. Results demonstrate that integrating quantum computing to hybridize conventional linear combinations of particle dynamics serves as an effective high performance computing paradigm. By further extending into the numerical investigation of viscoelastic, highly elastic, and purely elastic fluids under high Weissenberg number conditions, the applicability of quantum-hybrid framework is significantly broadened. These advances provide critical insights facilitating the transition of quantum-enhanced fluid simulation toward practical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Turbulent wind thrust control to reduce pitch motion of floating wind platforms with improved rotor operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the dynamic analysis of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) in realistic operating environment, this paper develops a coupled aero-hydro-mooring-servo model applicable to turbulent wind and irregular sea states with high computational efficiency. A modified rotor control strategy with platform motion feedback is proposed with a novel gain-scheduling technique to mitigate the negative damping effect on platform motions and decouple the rotor dynamics from the platform dynamics for better rotor operating performance. Firstly, the performance for the bottom-fixed wind turbine in steady uniform wind is validated and the turbulent wind tests show that using the rotor-disk-averaged wind speed for control is beneficial for reducing fluctuations of wind thrust and operational parameters compared with using the hub-height wind speed. For the FOWT, the negative damping phenomenon at above-rated wind speeds when using the baseline control is demonstrated through a range of wind and wave scenarios, and effects of control strategy and turbulent wind are investigated. The results indicate that the modified control strategy eliminates the negative damping effect on the platform pitch while maintaining small variations in rotor speed. Though the control including the blade pitch compensation from platform motion feedback with a constant gain can also eliminate the negative damping effect, it produces much larger fluctuations in rotor speed and causes larger overspeed exceeding the safety threshold of 20% at large wind speeds. Compared to steady wind, turbulent wind yields significantly larger low-frequency platform responses and increases the maximum rotor speed by 7.9% to 23.7% for the wind speeds considered.</description>

      <title>Scale-by-scale kinetic energy budgets in multiphase turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work aims at exploring the scale-by-scale kinetic energy exchanges in multiphase turbulence. For this purpose, we derive the K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin equation which accounts for the variations of density and viscosity across the two phases together with the effect of surface tension. We consider both conventional and phase conditional averaging operators. This framework is applied to numerical data from detailed simulations of forced homogeneous and isotropic turbulence covering different values for the liquid volume fraction, the liquid/gas density ratio, the Reynolds, and Weber numbers. We confirm the existence of an additional transfer term due to surface tension. Part of the kinetic energy injected at large scales is transferred into kinetic energy at smaller scales by classical non-linear transport while another part is transferred to surface energy before being released back into kinetic energy, but at smaller scales. The overall kinetic energy transfer rate is larger than in single phase flows. Kinetic energy budgets conditioned in a given phase show that the scale-by-scale transport of turbulent kinetic energy due to pressure is a gain (loss) of kinetic energy for the lighter (heavier) phase. Its contribution can be dominant when the gas volume fraction becomes small or when the density ratio increases. Building on previous work, we hypothesize the existence of a pivotal scale above which kinetic energy is stored into surface deformation and below which the kinetic energy is released by interface restoration. Some phenomenological predictions for this scale are discussed.</description>

      <title>Oscillating Heat Transfer Prediction in Porous Structures Using Generative AI-Assisted Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting and interpreting thermal performance under oscillating flow in porous structures remains a critical challenge due to the complex coupling between fluid dynamics and geometric features. This study introduces a data-driven wGAN-LBM-Nested_CV framework that integrates generative deep learning, numerical simulation based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), and interpretable machine learning to predict and explain the thermal behavior in such systems. A wide range of porous structures with diverse topologies were synthesized using a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (wGAN-GP), significantly expanding the design space. High-fidelity thermal data were then generated through LBM simulations across various Reynolds (Re) and Strouhal numbers (St). Among several machine learning models evaluated via nested cross-validation and Bayesian optimization, XGBoost achieved the best predictive performance for the average Nusselt number (Nu) (R^2=0.9981). Model interpretation using SHAP identified the Reynolds number, Strouhal number, porosity, specific surface area, and pore size dispersion as the most influential predictors, while also revealing synergistic interactions among them. Threshold-based insights, including Re &gt; 75 and porosity &gt; 0.6256, provide practical guidance for enhancing convective heat transfer. This integrated approach delivers both quantitative predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering actionable guidelines for designing porous media with improved thermal performance under oscillatory flow conditions.</description>

      <title>Rheological Insights from the Oscillation Dynamics of Viscoelastic Sessile Drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the oscillation behavior of a sessile drop placed on a hydrophobic substrate subjected to vertical vibrations with varying frequencies and amplitudes. We examined the responses of both Newtonian and viscoelastic drops. For viscoelastic samples, image analysis techniques were employed to correlate the drop dynamics with the rheological properties of the material. Overall, we demonstrate that this drop-based method allows for oscillatory shear experiments at frequencies that are difficult to access using conventional rheometers. The results reveal that the essential features of the drop response can be explained by the ratio of two characteristic time scales: the internal polymer relaxation time ($t_{p}$) and the external forcing time scale ($1/f$). This ratio defines the Deborah number ($De$). When the two time scales are comparable ($De \approx 1$), viscous dissipation dominates, which is observed in Lissajous curves and the drop's profile. At very low Deborah numbers ($De \ll 1$), the drop behaves like a Newtonian fluid (having a peak around natural frequency of the drop), while at high Deborah numbers ($De \gg 1$), it exhibits an elastic response. Furthermore, we show that increasing the applied deformation drives the system into the nonlinear viscoelastic regime. In this regime, unlike traditional rheology measurements, we observe the presence of $even$ and $odd$ harmonics in the drop response. This is attributed to the inherent geometric asymmetry of the drop setup, which breaks the symmetric assumptions typically present in standard rheological techniques.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Simulations of Two Miscible Fluids in Small Scale Turbulent Mixers Using a Variational Multiscale Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent mixers have been widely used in industrial settings for chemical production and increasingly for therapeutic nanoparticle formulation by antisolvent precipitation. The quality of the product is closely related to the fluid and mixing dynamics inside the mixers. Due to the rapid time scales and small sizes of many turbulent mixing geometries, computational fluid dynamics simulations have been the primary tool used to predict and understand fluid behavior within these mixers. In this study, we used the residual-based variational multiscale finite element method to perform high-fidelity turbulent simulations on two commonly used turbulent mixers: the multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) and the confined impinging jets mixer (CIJM). We simulated two geometric variations, two-inlets and four-inlets, of the MIVM and two different inflow ratios of the CIJM. Through detailed turbulence results, we identify differences in turbulence onset, total energy, and mixing performance of the two MIVM configurations. With the CIJM results, we demonstrate the effect of the flow rate ratio on the impingement behavior, and as a result, on the mixing performance and turbulence. The cross-comparison between the two mixers shows key differences in turbulence and mixing behaviors, such as the turbulence onset, the energy decay, and the output mixing index. This study demonstrates the importance of a high-accuracy numerical scheme in simulating the turbulent mixers and understanding the similarities and differences among mixers. Furthermore, the results show potential for optimizing the operating conditions to achieve the best mixing performance.</description>

      <title>The power spectrum of compressible turbulence: A story in symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a theoretical study of the scaling properties of the kinetic energy spectrum in compressible turbulence. From the fundamental symmetries and linear transformations of the microscopic action, we derive exact relations between the correlation functions and their generators. These relations put strong constraints on the possible scaling relations in the system as a function of scale. One of the main results of this study is that the action can be split between an incompressible part, which is the same as in the usual stochastic Navier-Stokes theory whatever the value of the Mach number, and a longitudinal part, whose behavior is to be compared to the three dimensional Burgers equation, which presents a much richer phase diagram as its usually discussed one dimensionalcounterpart.</description>

      <title>Superresolving Non-linear PDE Dynamics with Reduced-Order Autodifferentiable Ensemble Kalman Filtering For Turbulence Modeling and Flow Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately reconstructing and forecasting high-resolution (HR) states from computationally cheap low-resolution (LR) observations is central to estimation-and-control of spatio-temporal PDE systems. We develop a unified superresolution pipeline based on the reduced-order autodifferentiable Ensemble Kalman filter (ROAD-EnKF). The method learns a low-dimensional latent dynamics model and a nonlinear decoder from latent variables to HR fields; the learned pair is embedded in an EnKF, enabling simultaneous state estimation and control-oriented forecasting with quantified uncertainty. We evaluate on three benchmarks: 1-D viscous Burgers equation (shock formation), Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation (chaotic dynamics), and 2-D Navier-Stokes-Kraichnan turbulence (NSKT) (vortex decaying dynamics at Re 16,000). LR data are obtained by factors of 4-8 downsampling per spatial dimension and are corrupted with noise. On Burgers and KS, the latent models remain stable far beyond the observation window, accurately predicting shock propagation and chaotic attractor statistics up to 150 steps. On 2-D NSKT, the approach preserves the kinetic-energy spectrum and enstrophy budget of the HR data, indicating suitability for control scenarios that depend on fine-scale flow features. These results position ROAD-EnKF as a principled and efficient framework for physics-constrained superresolution, bridging LR sensing and HR actuation across diverse PDE regimes.</description>

      <title>IGA-LBM: Isogeometric lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann method has become a widely adopted approach in computational fluid dynamics, offering unique advantages in mesoscopic kinetic modeling, intrinsic parallelism, and simple treatment of boundary conditions. However, its conventional reliance on Cartesian grids fundamentally limits geometric fidelity in flows involving curved boundaries, introducing stair-step artifacts that propagate as spurious forces and boundary-layer inaccuracies.
  To address these challenges, we propose the isogeometric lattice Boltzmann method, which seamlessly integrates Isogeometric Analysis with LBM, leveraging the geometric precision of non-uniform rational B-Splines to construct body-fitted computational grids. Unlike conventional Cartesian-based LBM, the proposed approach eliminates stair-step boundary artifacts by providing sub-element geometric accuracy while maintaining the efficiency of LBM. Furthermore, the higher-order continuity of NURBS improves gradient resolution, reducing numerical diffusion in high-Reynold's-number flows. The parametric grid adaptation of IGA enables $h$-, $p$-, and $k$-refinement strategies, allowing for localized resolution enhancement in boundary layers and regions with high solution gradients. Additionally, the diffeomorphic mapping properties of IGA ensure intrinsic conservation, preserving advection invariants and suppressing numerical oscillations, leading to enhanced stability.
  Benchmark simulations on flows with curved and complex geometries demonstrate that IGA-LBM delivers significantly more accurate boundary-layer predictions and pressure/force estimates than standard Cartesian LBM, while preserving its computational efficiency and scalability. By combining geometric exactness with the algorithmic simplicity of LBM, IGA-LBM offers a practical route to high-fidelity simulations in engineering and scientific applications.</description>

Abstract: Dimensional analysis is one of the most fundamental tools for understanding physical systems. However, the construction of dimensionless variables, as guided by the Buckingham-$\pi$ theorem, is not uniquely determined. Here, we introduce IT-$\pi$, a model-free method that combines dimensionless learning with the principles of information theory. Grounded in the irreducible error theorem, IT-$\pi$ identifies dimensionless variables with the highest predictive power by measuring their shared information content. The approach is able to rank variables by predictability, identify distinct physical regimes, uncover self-similar variables, determine the characteristic scales of the problem, and extract its dimensionless parameters. IT-$\pi$ also provides a bound of the minimum predictive error achievable across all possible models, from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning techniques, naturally enabling a definition of model efficiency. We benchmark IT-$\pi$ across different cases and demonstrate that it offers superior performance and capabilities compared to existing tools. The method is also applied to conduct dimensionless learning for supersonic turbulence, aerodynamic drag on both smooth and irregular surfaces, magnetohydrodynamic power generation, and laser-metal interaction.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resonance of rotating particles in turbulence</title>

Abstract: The chaotic dynamics of small-scale vorticity plays a key role in understanding and controlling turbulence, with direct implications for energy transfer, mixing, and coherent structure evolution. However, measuring or controlling its dynamics remains a major conceptual and experimental challenge due to its transient and chaotic nature. Here we use a combination of experiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of different densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics, can act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its smallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally controllable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale turbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we present the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in turbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise, counterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external forcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational phase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity of small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking mechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity remarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean vorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in "surfing" the magnetic field. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in complex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for measuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic fields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Analytical Turbulence Closures for Quasi-Geostrophic Ocean Flows with Coastal Boundaries</title>

Abstract: Numerical turbulence simulations typically involve parameterizations such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Applications to geophysical flows, especially ocean flows, are further complicated by the presence of complex topography and interior landforms such as coastlines, islands, and capes. In this work, we extend pseudo-spectral quasi-geostrophic (QG) numerical schemes and GPU-based solvers to simulate flows with coastal boundaries using the Brinkman volume penalization approach. We incorporate sponging and a splitting scheme to handle inflow and aperiodic boundary conditions. We evaluate four analytical sub-grid-scale (SGS) closures based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis: the standard Smagorinsky and Leith closures, and their dynamic variants. We show applications to QG flows past circular islands and capes with the beta-plane approximation. We perform both a priori analysis of the SGS closure terms as well as a posteriori assessment of the SGS terms and simulated vorticity fields. Our results showcase differences between the various closures, especially their approach to phase and feature reconstruction errors in the presence of coastal boundaries.</description>

      <title>Distributed force element decomposition with method of fundamental solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07783</link>

Abstract: Quantifying the contribution of vortex structures to pressure stress is useful for designing flow control strategies to mitigate low or drag. The traditional force-element method focuses on the contribution of vortex structures to the resultant force. However, the contribution of vortex structures to the distributed force can not be identified. To address this problem, a distributed force element method is proposed. This method projects the Navier-Stokes equation to a divergence-free space and obtain a Poisson equation for pressure. The Green's function is employed to express pressure stress on the solid boundary as a combination of volume and surface integrals. Contributions to the distributed source are divided into acceleration surface elements, vorticity surface elements, convection volume elements. The method of fundamental solutions and singular value decomposition are used to efficiently solve the Green's functions. The distributed force element method is validated using laminar flows around a stationary circular cylinder and oscillating circular cylinder, and three-dimensional laminar and turbulent flows around a sphere. In laminar flow over a circular cylinder, fluctuation of forces mainly originate from volume sources, while in flow over an oscillating circular cylinder, inertial and volume source terms may cancel out, suppressing lift fluctuation. In flows over a sphere, a strong negative volume source in the boundary layer on the sphere creates low-pressure regions, while pressure in the separated shear layer is close to zero.</description>

      <title>Impact of Small-Scale Gravity Waves on Tracer Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small-scale gravity waves, with horizontal wavelengths of up to a few hundred kilometers and vertical wavelengths of up to a few kilometers, play a crucial role in atmospheric tracer transport. However, their effects remain unresolved in climate models and must be parameterized. This study investigates how gravity waves influence large-scale tracer distributions, utilizing a multiple-scale analysis to systematically identify the governing terms of gravity wave-induced tracer fluxes. The analysis reveals both leading-order and next-order impacts: the former being the inertia-gravity wave-induced tracer Stokes drift, which acts perpendicular to both the large-scale tracer gradient and the wave number, while the latter becomes significant at lower latitudes where Coriolis effects diminish. A numerical framework is developed to incorporate these fluxes into a gravity wave parameterization model, potentially enhancing climate model accuracy without requiring explicit resolution of small-scale wave dynamics. Model validation against high-resolution wave-resolving simulations confirms the effectiveness of this approach. By improving the representation of gravity wave-induced tracer transport, this research advances the accuracy of climate simulations, particularly in their depiction of microphysics and radiative processes.</description>
