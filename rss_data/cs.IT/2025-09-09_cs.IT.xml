      <title>Efficient Low-Memory Fast Stack Decoding with Variance Polarization for PAC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes have recently emerged as a promising class of error-correcting codes, achieving near-capacity performance particularly in the short block-length regime. In this paper, we propose an enhanced stack decoding algorithm for PAC codes that significantly improves parallelization by exploiting specialized bit nodes, such as rate-0 and rate-1 nodes. For a rate-1 node with $N_0$ leaf nodes in its corresponding subtree, conventional stack decoding must either explore all $2^{N_0}$ paths, or, same as in fast list decoding, restrict attention to a constant number of candidate paths. In contrast, our approach introduces a pruning technique that discards wrong paths with a probability exponentially approaching zero, retaining only those whose path metrics remain close to their expected mean values. Furthermore, we propose a novel approximation method for estimating variance polarization under the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel. Leveraging these approximations, we develop an efficient stack-pruning strategy that selectively preserves decoding paths whose bit-metric values align with their expected means. This targeted pruning substantially reduces the number of active paths in the stack, thereby decreasing both decoding latency and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that for a PAC(128,64) code, our method achieves up to a 70% reduction in the average number of paths without degrading error-correction performance.</description>

      <title>Single and Multi-Frequency Path Loss Models for Indoor Hotspot Scenario Based on Measurements Conducted at 6.75, 16.95, 28, 73 and 142 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation of single and multi-frequency large-scale path loss model parameters for the close-in (CI) free space reference distance, CI free space reference distance with cross-polarization (CIX), floating-intercept (FI), CI free space reference distance with frequency-dependent path loss exponent (CIF), CI free space reference distance with frequency-dependent path loss exponent and cross-polarization (CIFX), alpha-beta-gamma (ABG), and alpha-beta-gamma with cross-polarization (ABGX) models for specific frequencies and across frequency ranges of 7-24 GHz, 0.5-100 GHz, and 0.5-150 GHz. The analysis is based on extensive real-world measurements conducted by NYU WIRELESS at 6.75 GHz, 16.95 GHz, 28 GHz, 73 GHz, and 142 GHz, using a 1 GHz wideband time-domain based sliding correlation channel sounder in the indoor hotspot (InH) scenario in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel conditions. Specifically, the derived CI, FI, and ABG path loss model parameters for 7-24 GHz and 0.5-100 GHz frequency ranges in this article were submitted in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to validate Technical Report (TR) 38.901 InH path loss models, as part of the release (Rel) 19 study on "Channel Model Validation of TR 38.901 for 7-24 GHz." Furthermore, the results in this paper provide critical insights into understanding large-scale path loss, comparing different path loss models, and extending the path loss models standardized by 3GPP and ITU for the InH scenario, which is essential for advancing next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation Driven Semantic NOMA for Image Transmission with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a promising 6G enabler beyond conventional bit-level transmission, semantic communication can considerably reduce required bandwidth resources, while its combination with multiple access requires further exploration. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD) semantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for multi-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust feature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop a ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with enhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise ratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image restoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on interference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature affinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a diffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform initial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions. These results highlight the advantages in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual metrics, effectively mitigating interference and enabling high-quality image recovery.</description>

      <title>SKR Analysis of MIMO FSO Systems with One- and Two-way CV-QKD Protocols in Hybrid Quantum Noise Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) free-space optical (FSO) communication system is considered in this paper, which supports the secret key transmission between two legitimate users, Alice and Bob, by employing continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). The wireless channels are subjected to the effects of atmospheric turbulence that lead to beam spreading, pointing error, and turbulence-induced fading, which, along with the presence of hybrid quantum noise, negatively impact the secret key exchange between Alice and Bob. Furthermore, the security of the communication system is considered to be compromised due to the intervention of an eavesdropper, Eve, employing a collective Gaussian attack to intercept the secret key exchange. For this system, novel one-way and two-way protocols are proposed to enhance the security of the transmitted keys. The transmissivity of the FSO channels is mathematically formulated, and the bounds on the mutual information between the transmitted and received coherent states are obtained, using which, novel expressions for the secret key rates (SKRs) for the one-way and two-way protocols are derived. Asymptotic expressions for the SKRs and numerical results corroborating the analytical framework are also presented, which demonstrate the SKR gains obtained by employing MIMO and the two-way protocol for the FSO CV-QKD system.</description>

      <title>Tesla meets Helstrom: a Wireless-Powered Quantum Optical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates a novel wireless-powered quantum optical communication system, in which a batteryless quantum transmitter harvests energy from a classical radio-frequency source to transmit quantum coherent states. The transmission employs M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) modulation over an optical channel impaired by thermal noise, and the fundamental detection performance is evaluated using the Helstrom bound. An optimization framework is proposed that jointly determines the optimal quantum measurement and the energy-harvesting time fraction to maximize the effective rate under a block time constraint. Analytical expressions are derived for special cases, while semidefinite programming techniques are employed for the general M-PSK scenario. Numerical results validate the unimodal nature of the effective rate function and demonstrate the impact of the optimal design parameters.</description>

      <title>Linear time encodable binary code achieving GV bound with linear time encodable dual achieving GV bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of what we term ``fast good codes'' with ``fast good duals.'' Specifically, we consider the task of constructing a binary linear code $C \leq \mathcal{F}_2^n$ such that both it and its dual $C^\perp :=\{x \in \mathcal{F}_2^n:\forall c \in C, \langle x,c\rangle=0\}$ are asymptotically good (in fact, have rate-distance tradeoff approaching the GV bound), and are encodable in $O(n)$ time. While we believe such codes should find applications more broadly, as motivation we describe how such codes can be used the secure computation task of encrypted matrix-vector product, as studied by Behhamouda et al (CCS 2025, to appear).
  Our main contribution is a construction of such a fast good code with fast good dual. Our construction is inspired by the repeat multiple accumulate (RMA) codes of Divsalar, Jin and McEliece (Allerton, 1998). To create the rate 1/2 code, after repeating each message coordinate, we perform accumulation steps -- where first a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the prefix-sum mod 2 is applied -- which are alternated with discrete derivative steps -- where again a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the previous two coordinates are summed mod 2. Importantly, these two operations are inverse of each other. In particular, the dual of the code is very similar, with the accumulation and discrete derivative steps reversed.
  Our analysis is inspired by a prior analysis of RMA codes due to Ravazzi and Fagnani (IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, 2009). The main idea is to bound the input-output weight-enumerator function: the expected number of messages of a given weight that are encoded into a codeword of a given weight. We face new challenges in controlling the behaviour of the discrete derivative matrix (which can significantly drop the weight of a vector), which we overcome by careful case analysis.</description>

      <title>Multi-Static Target Position Estimation and System Optimization for Cell-Free mMIMO-OTFS ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates multi-static position estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) architectures, where orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is used as an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signal. A maximum likelihood position estimation scheme is proposed, where the required search space is reduced by employing a common reference system. Closed-form expressions for the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and the position error bound (PEB) in multi-static position estimation are derived, providing quantitative evaluations of sensing performance. These theoretical bounds are further generalized into a universal structure to support other ISAC signals. To enhance overall system performance and adapt to dynamic network requirements, a joint AP operation mode selection and power allocation algorithm is developed to maximize the minimum user communication spectral efficiency (SE) while ensuring a specified sensing PEB requirement. Moreover, a decomposition method is introduced to achieve a better tradeoff between complexity and ISAC performance. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, demonstrating the superiority of the OTFS signal through a nearly twofold SE gain over the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. These findings highlight promising advantages of the CF-ISAC systems from a novel parameter estimation perspective, particularly in high-mobility vehicle-to-everything applications.</description>

      <title>RAQ-MIMO: MIMO for Multi-Band Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) are capable of receiving multi-band radio-frequency (RF) signals simultaneously, which are expected to break Chu's limit for classical electronic antennas. However, signals from different users will interfere with each other in the optical intermediate frequency (IF) domain of the multi-band quantum receiver, which is termed the IF interference (IFI) problem. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQ-MIMO) by exploiting the additional spatial diversity of MIMO receivers. Specifically, by applying the dynamic signal model of RAQRs, we clarify the physical relationship between the quantum local oscillator (LO) configurations and the multi-band gains with the concept of quantum transconductance. Then, with the quantum transconductance-based signal model, we formulate the spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem and further propose the quantum weighted minimum mean square error (qWMMSE) algorithm, which jointly optimizes the quantum LO configurations and the classical precoder/combiner matrices. Furthermore, we test the qWMMSE algorithm within the standard space division multiple access (SDMA) scheme and the frequency division multiple access (FDMA) scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the qWMMSE optimization framework can significantly improve the SE of RAQ-MIMO systems for both multiple access schemes, and that RAQ-MIMO systems can outperform classical electronic receiver-based multi-user MIMO systems by eliminating the mutual coupling effect between classical antennas.</description>

      <title>Cross-field SNR Analysis and Tensor Channel Estimation for Multi-UAV Near-field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems. We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model, within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor, enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP, while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.</description>

      <title>Measuring Uncertainty in Transformer Circuits with Effective Information Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is deferred.</description>

      <title>Besting Good--Turing: Optimality of Non-Parametric Maximum Likelihood for Distribution Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When faced with a small sample from a large universe of possible outcomes, scientists often turn to the venerable Good--Turing estimator. Despite its pedigree, however, this estimator comes with considerable drawbacks, such as the need to hand-tune smoothing parameters and the lack of a precise optimality guarantee. We introduce a parameter-free estimator that bests Good--Turing in both theory and practice. Our method marries two classic ideas, namely Robbins's empirical Bayes and Kiefer--Wolfowitz non-parametric maximum likelihood estimation (NPMLE), to learn an implicit prior from data and then convert it into probability estimates. We prove that the resulting estimator attains the optimal instance-wise risk up to logarithmic factors in the competitive framework of Orlitsky and Suresh, and that the Good--Turing estimator is strictly suboptimal in the same framework. Our simulations on synthetic data and experiments with English corpora and U.S. Census data show that our estimator consistently outperforms both the Good--Turing estimator and explicit Bayes procedures.</description>

      <title>Beyond Rebalancing: Benchmarking Binary Classifiers Under Class Imbalance Without Rebalancing Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification, particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance. The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.</description>

      <title>ExSEnt: Extrema-Segmented Entropy Analysis of Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Extrema-Segmented Entropy (ExSEnt), a feature-decomposed framework for quantifying time-series complexity that separates temporal from amplitude contributions. The method partitions a signal into monotonic segments by detecting sign changes in the first-order increments. For each segment, it extracts the interval duration and the net amplitude change, generating two sequences that reflect timing and magnitude variability, respectively. Complexity is then quantified by computing sample entropy on durations and amplitudes, together with their joint entropy. This decomposition reveals whether overall irregularity is driven by timing, amplitude, or their coupling, providing a richer and more interpretable characterization than unidimensional metrics. We validate ExSEnt on canonical nonlinear dynamical systems (Logistic map, Rossler system, Rulkov map), demonstrating its ability to track complexity changes across control parameter sweeps and detect transitions between periodic and chaotic regimes. Then, we illustrate the empirical utility of ExSEnt metrics to isolate feature-specific sources of complexity in real data (electromyography and ankle acceleration in Parkinsons disease). ExSEnt thus complements existing entropy measures by attributing complexity to distinct signal features, improving interpretability and supporting applications in a broad range of domains, including physiology, finance, and geoscience.</description>

      <title>Dual of Algebraic Geometry codes from Hirzebruch surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an explicit form for the dual of the algebraic geometry code $C_e(a,b)$ defined on an Hirzebruch surface $\mathcal{H}_e$ and parametrized by the divisor $aS_e + bF_e$, where $a,b\in\mathbb{N}$ and $S_e$ and $F_e$ generate the Picard group $\mathrm{Pic}( \mathcal{H}_e)$. Notably, we compute a lower bound for the minimum distance of $C_e(a,b)^\perp$. One of the main ingredient for our study is a new explicit form of the code $C_e(a,b)$ which we provide at the beginning of the paper. We also investigate some puncturing of $C_e(a,b)$, recovering other previously studied AG codes from toric surfaces. Finally, we provide a sufficient condition for orthogonal inclusions between the codes $C_e(a,b)$, and construct CSS quantum codes from them.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Large-scale Network Optimization: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of large-scale 6G-and-beyond networks demands innovative approaches for multi-objective optimization over vast search spaces, a task often intractable. Quantum computing (QC) emerges as a promising technology for efficient large-scale optimization. We present our vision of leveraging QC to tackle key classes of problems in future mobile networks. By analyzing and identifying common features, particularly their graph-centric representation, we propose a unified strategy involving QC algorithms. Specifically, we outline a methodology for optimization using quantum annealing as well as quantum reinforcement learning. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges that QC algorithms and hardware must overcome to effectively optimize future networks.</description>

      <title>Fast Decoding of Interleaved Linearized Reed-Solomon Codes and Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct $s$-interleaved linearized Reed--Solomon (ILRS) codes and variants and propose efficient decoding schemes that can correct errors beyond the unique decoding radius in the sum-rank metric. The proposed interpolation-based scheme for ILRS codes can be used as a list decoder or as a probabilistic unique decoder that corrects errors of sum-rank up to $t\leq\frac{s}{s+1}(n-k)$, where $s$ is the interleaving order, $n$ the length and $k$ the dimension of the code. Upper bounds on the list size and the decoding failure probability are given where the latter is based on a novel Loidreau--Overbeck-like decoder for ILRS codes. We show how the proposed decoding schemes can be used to decode errors beyond the unique decoding radius in the skew metric by using an isometry between the sum-rank metric and the skew metric.
  We generalize fast minimal approximant basis interpolation techniques to obtain efficient decoding schemes for ILRS codes (and variants) with subquadratic complexity in the code length.
  Up to our knowledge, the presented decoding schemes are the first being able to correct errors beyond the unique decoding region in the sum-rank and skew metric. The performance of the proposed decoding schemes and the tightness of the upper bound on the decoding failure probability are validated via Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Joint Waveform Design for MIMO-OFDM DFRC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) has attracted considerable attention. This paper considers the frequency-selective multipath fading environment and proposes DFRC waveform design schemes based on multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. In the proposed waveform design schemes, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the radar system, the inter-stream interference (ISI) and the achievable rate of the communication system, are respectively considered as the performance metrics. In this paper, we focus on the performance trade-off between the radar system and the communication system, and the optimization problems are formulated. In the ISI minimization based waveform design scheme, the optimization problem is convex and can be easily solved. In the achievable rate maximization based waveform design scheme, we propose a water-filling (WF) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based algorithm to derive the covariance matrix and the precoding matrix. Simulation results validate the proposed DFRC waveform designs and show that the achievable rate maximization based scheme has a better performance than the ISI minimization based scheme.</description>

Abstract: We study the connection between mixing properties for bipartite graphs and materialization of the mutual information in one-shot settings. We show that mixing properties of a graph imply impossibility to extract the mutual information shared by the ends of an edge randomly sampled in the graph. We apply these impossibility results to some questions motivated by information-theoretic cryptography. In particular, we show that communication complexity of a secret key agreement in one-shot setting is inherently uneven: for some inputs, almost all communication complexity inevitably falls on only one party.</description>

      <title>Revisiting XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: When Dual-Wideband Effects Meet Near Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems introduces significant near-field effects, such as spherical wavefront propagation and spatially non-stationary (SnS) properties. When combined with the dual-wideband effects inherent to wideband systems, these phenomena fundamentally alter the channel's sparsity patterns in the angular-delay domain, rendering existing estimation methods insufficient. To address these challenges, this paper reconsiders the channel estimation problem for wideband XL-MIMO systems. Leveraging the spatial-chirp property of array responses, we first quantitatively characterize the angular-delay domain sparsity of wideband XL-MIMO channels, revealing both global block sparsity and local common-delay sparsity. To effectively capture this structured sparsity, we then propose a novel column-wise hierarchical prior model that integrates a precision sharing mechanism and a Markov random field (MRF) structure. Building on this prior model, the channel estimation task is formulated as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-based Bayesian inference problem. Tailored to the complex factor graph induced by this hierarchical prior, we develop a MMV-based hybrid message passing (MMV-HMP) algorithm. This algorithm performs message updates along the edges of the factor graph, and selectively applies either the variational message passing (VMP) or sum-product (SP) rules, depending on the factor-node structure and message tractability. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed column-wise hierarchical prior model through ablation studies and demonstrate that the MMV-HMP algorithm, while maintaining moderate computational complexity, consistently outperforms existing baselines which fail to capture the structured sparsity of wideband XL-MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>A higher-order Otto calculus approach to the Gaussian completely monotone conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaussian completely monotone (GCM) conjecture states that the $m$-th time-derivative of the entropy along the heat flow on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is positive for $m$ even and negative for $m$ odd. We prove the GCM conjecture for orders up to $m=5$, assuming that the initial measure is log-concave, in any dimension. Our proof differs significantly from previous approaches to the GCM conjecture: it is based on Otto calculus and on the interpretation of the heat flow as the Wasserstein gradient flow of the entropy. Crucial to our methodology is the observation that the convective derivative behaves as a flat connection over probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular we prove a form of the univariate Faa di Bruno's formula on the Wasserstein space (despite it being curved), and we compute the higher-order Wasserstein differentials of internal energy functionals (including the entropy), both of which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Matrix Completion in Group Testing: Bounds and Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of group testing is to identify a small number of defective items within a large population. In the non-adaptive setting, tests are designed in advance and represented by a measurement matrix $\mM$, where rows correspond to tests and columns to items. A test is positive if it includes at least one defective item. Traditionally, $\mM$ remains fixed during both testing and recovery. In this work, we address the case where some entries of $\mM$ are missing, yielding a missing measurement matrix $\mG$. Our aim is to reconstruct $\mM$ from $\mG$ using available samples and their outcome vectors.
  The above problem can be considered as a problem intersected between Boolean matrix factorization and matrix completion, called the matrix completion in group testing (MCGT) problem, as follows. Given positive integers $t,s,n$, let $\mY:=(y_{ij}) \in \{0, 1\}^{t \times s}$, $\mM:=(m_{ij}) \in \{0,1\}^{t \times n}$, $\mX:=(x_{ij}) \in \{0,1\}^{n \times s}$, and matrix $\mG \in \{0,1 \}^{t \times n}$ be a matrix generated from matrix $\mM$ by erasing some entries in $\mM$. Suppose $\mY:=\mM \odot \mX$, where an entry $y_{ij}:=\bigvee_{k=1}^n (m_{ik}\wedge x_{kj})$, and $\wedge$ and $\vee$ are AND and OR operators. Unlike the problem in group testing whose objective is to find $\mX$ when given $\mM$ and $\mY$, our objective is to recover $\mM$ given $\mY,\mX$, and $\mG$.
  We first prove that the MCGT problem is NP-complete. Next, we show that certain rows with missing entries aid recovery while others do not. For Bernoulli measurement matrices, we establish that larger $s$ increases the higher the probability that $\mM$ can be recovered. We then instantiate our bounds for specific decoding algorithms and validate them through simulations, demonstrating superiority over standard matrix completion and Boolean matrix factorization methods.</description>

      <title>Limitations to Computing Quadratic Functions on Reed-Solomon Encoded Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of low-bandwidth non-linear computation on Reed-Solomon encoded data. Given an $[n,k]$ Reed-Solomon encoding of a message vector $\mathbf{f} \in \mathbb{F}_q^k$, and a polynomial $g \in \mathbb{F}_q[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k]$, a user wishing to evaluate $g(\mathbf{f})$ is given local query access to each codeword symbol. The query response is allowed to be the output of an arbitrary function evaluated locally on the codeword symbol, and the user's aim is to minimize the total information downloaded in order to compute $g(\mathbf{f})$. This problem has been studied before for \emph{linear} functions $g$; in this work we initiate the study of non-linear functions by starting with quadratic monomials.
  For $q = p^e$ and distinct $i,j \in [k]$, we show that any scheme evaluating the quadratic monomial $g_{i,j} := X_i X_j$ must download at least $2 \log_2(q-1) - 3$ bits of information when $p$ is an odd prime, and at least $2\log_2(q-2) -4$ bits when $p=2$. When $k=2$, our result shows that one cannot do significantly better than the naive bound of $k \log_2(q)$ bits, which is enough to recover all of $\mathbf{f}$. This contrasts sharply with prior work for low-bandwidth evaluation of \emph{linear} functions $g(\mathbf{f})$ over Reed-Solomon encoded data, for which prior work has shown it is possible to substantially improve upon this bound.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Large-Sample Majorization of Pairs of Flat States in Terms of {\alpha}-z Relative Entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We offer the first operational interpretation of the {\alpha}-z relative entropies, a measure of distinguishability between two quantum states introduced by Jak\v{s}i\'c et al. and Audenaert and Datta. We show that these relative entropies appear when formulating conditions for large-sample or catalytic relative majorization of pairs of flat states and certain generalizations of them. Indeed, we show that such transformations exist if and only if all the {\alpha}-z relative entropies of the two pairs are ordered. In this setting, the {\alpha} and z parameters are truly independent from each other. These results also yield an expression for the optimal rate of converting one flat state pair into another. Our methods use real-algebraic techniques involving preordered semirings and certain monotone homomorphisms and derivations on them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Frostman conditions for bivariate random variables and study discretized entropy sum-product phenomena in both independent and dependent regimes. We prove that for any non-degenerate rational quadratic form $\phi(x, y)$ and parameter $0 &lt; s &lt; 1$, there exists a positive constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(\phi,s)$ such that \[ \max\{H_n(X+Y), H_n(\phi(X,Y))\} \geq n(s+\epsilon) \] for sufficiently large $n$, where the precise conditions on $(X,Y)$ depend on the Frostman level. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case.
  As an application, we derive a result on a discretized sum-product type problem. In particular, for a $\delta$-separated set $A\subset [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$, satisfying some non-concentration conditions, and a dense subset $G\subset A\times A$, there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s, \phi)&gt;0$ such that $$ E_\delta(A+_GA) + E_\delta(\phi_G(A, A)) \gg\delta^{-\epsilon}(\#A) $$ for all $\delta$ small enough. Here by $E_\delta(A)$ we mean the $\delta$-covering number of $A$, $\{A+_GA:=\{x+y\colon (x, y)\in G\}$, and $\phi_G(A):=\{\phi(x, y)\colon (x, y)\in G\}$.</description>

      <title>A Novel Image Similarity Metric for Scene Composition Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05037v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc. Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal, neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM), a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely, it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of scene composition.</description>

      <title>Estimating the size of a set using cascading exclusion</title>

Abstract: Let $S$ be a finite set, and $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ an i.i.d. uniform sample from $S$. To estimate the size $|S|$, without further structure, one can wait for repeats and use the birthday problem. This requires a sample size of the order $|S|^\frac{1}{2}$. On the other hand, if $S=\{1,2,\ldots,|S|\}$, the maximum of the sample blown up by $n/(n-1)$ gives an efficient estimator based on any growing sample size. This paper gives refinements that interpolate between these extremes. A general non-asymptotic theory is developed. This includes estimating the volume of a compact convex set, the unseen species problem, and a host of testing problems that follow from the question `Is this new observation a typical pick from a large prespecified population?' We also treat regression style predictors. A general theorem gives non-parametric finite $n$ error bounds in all cases.</description>

      <title>1-Bit Unlimited Sampling Beyond Fourier Domain: Low-Resolution Sampling of Quantization Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) play a critical role in digital signal acquisition across various applications, but their performance is inherently constrained by sampling rates and bit budgets. This bit budget imposes a trade-off between dynamic range (DR) and digital resolution, with ADC energy consumption scaling linearly with sampling rate and exponentially with bit depth. To bypass this, numerous approaches, including oversampling with low-resolution ADCs, have been explored. A prominent example is 1-Bit ADCs with Sigma-Delta Quantization (SDQ), a widely used consumer-grade solution. However, SDQs suffer from overloading or saturation issues, limiting their ability to handle inputs with arbitrary DR. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) addresses this challenge by injecting modulo non-linearity in hardware, resulting in a new digital sensing technology. In this paper, we introduce a novel 1-Bit sampling architecture that extends both conventional 1-Bit SDQ and USF. Our contributions are twofold: (1) We generalize the concept of noise shaping beyond the Fourier domain, allowing the inclusion of non-bandlimited signals in the Fourier domain but bandlimited in alternative transform domains. (2) Building on this generalization, we develop a new transform-domain recovery method for 1-Bit USF. When applied to the Fourier domain, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing time-domain techniques, offering reduced oversampling requirements and improved robustness. Extensive numerical experiments validate our findings, laying the groundwork for a broader generalization of 1-Bit sampling systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fault-Tolerant Surface Code Decoding with Iterative Lattice Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and realistic error decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) on near-term devices. While decoding is a classical post-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum noise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce the Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder, which systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error correction. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting: correlated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional probabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative procedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a hardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in finite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results under circuit-level noise show substantial improvements. For distances $\geq 17$ and physical error rates $\leq 0.001$, IRMWPM reduces logical error rates by over 20x with only a few iterations. It also raises the accuracy threshold from 1% to 1.16%, making it practical for near-term real-time decoding. Extrapolated estimates suggest that to reach logical error rate $10^{-16}$, IRMWPM requires distance $d=31$, while standard MWPM needs $d=50$, implying a major reduction in qubit overhead.</description>
