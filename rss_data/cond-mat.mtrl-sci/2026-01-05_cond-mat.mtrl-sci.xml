      <title>Atomic-Scale Mechanisms of Li-Ion Transport Mediated by Li10GeP2S12 in Composite Solid Polyethylene Oxide Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes incorporating Li$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) nanoparticles show promise for solid-state lithium batteries owing to their enhanced ionic conductivity, though the governing mechanisms remain unclear. We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Spectral Sampling of Boron Diffusion in Ni Alloys: Cr and Mo Effects on Bulk and Grain Boundary Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how light interstitials migrate in chemically complex alloys is essential for predicting defect dynamics and long-term stability. Here, we introduce a spectral sampling framework to quantify boron diffusion activation energies in Ni and demonstrate how substitutional solutes (Cr, Mo) reshape interstitial point defect transport in both the bulk and along crystallographic defects. In the bulk, boron migration energy distributions exhibit distinct modality tied to solute identity and spatial arrangement: both Cr and Mo raise barriers in symmetric cages but induce directional asymmetry in partially decorated environments. Extending this framework to a $\Sigma5\langle100\rangle{210}$ symmetric tilt grain boundary reveals solute-specific confinement effects. Cr preserves low-barrier in-plane mobility while suppressing out-of-plane transport, guiding boron into favorable midplane voids. Mo, by contrast, imposes an across-the-board reduction in boron mobility, suppressing average diffusivity by two additional orders of magnitude at 800 $^\circ$C and reducing out-of-plane transport by five orders of magnitude relative to Cr. Both elements promote segregation by producing negative segregation energies, but their roles diverge: Cr facilitates rapid redistribution and stabilization at interfacial sites, consistent with Cr-rich boride formation, while Mo creates deeper and more uniform segregation wells that strongly anchor boron. Together, these complementary behaviors explain the experimental prevalence of Cr- and Mo-rich borides at grain boundaries and carbide interfaces in Ni-based superalloys. More broadly, we establish spectral sampling as a transferable framework for interpreting diffusion in disordered alloys and for designing dopant strategies that control transport across complex interfaces.</description>

      <title>In context learning Foundation models for Materials Property Prediction with Small datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently shown remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities across diverse scientific domains. In this work, we introduce a unified in-context learning foundation model (ICL-FM) framework for materials property prediction that integrates both composition-based and structure-aware representations. The proposed approach couples the pretrained TabPFN transformer with graph neural network (GNN)-derived embeddings and our novel MagpieEX descriptors. MagpieEX augments traditional features with cation-anion interaction data to explicitly measure bond ionicity and charge-transfer asymmetry, capturing interatomic bonding characteristics that influence vibrational and thermal transport properties. Comprehensive experiments on the MatBench benchmark suite and a standalone lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) dataset demonstrate that ICL-FM achieves competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models with significantly reduced training costs. Remarkably, the training-free ICL-FM outperformed sophisticated SOTA GNN models in five out of six representative composition-based tasks, including a significant 9.93\% improvement in phonon frequency prediction. On the LTC dataset, the FM effectively models complex phenomena such as phonon-phonon scattering and atomic mass contrast. t-SNE analysis reveals that the FM acts as a physics-aware feature refiner, transforming raw, disjoint feature clusters into continuous manifolds with gradual property transitions. This restructured latent space enhances interpolative prediction accuracy while aligning learned representations with underlying physical laws. This study establishes ICL-FM as a generalizable, data-efficient paradigm for materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned potential for amorphous Indium-Tin-Oxide alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned potential-driven molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations are of great value in guiding the design and optimization of memory devices. Amorphous indium-tin-oxide (ITO) is widely used as transparent conducting oxide for flat-panel display and solar cell applications, and also as a capping layer in phase-change-materials-based reconfigurable color display devices. However, atomistic simulations of ITO using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) are limited to systems of a few hundred atoms due to expensive computational costs, which prevents the device-scale modelling of real-world applications. In this work, we develop a machine-learned potential for ITO and its parent phase In2O3 based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework. We generate a comprehensive training dataset using an iterative training protocol. Our MLMD simulations of crystalline, liquid and melt-quenched amorphous ITO models are in great agreement with the AIMD reference. In particular, the ML potential well captures the minority atomic interaction, such as Sn-Sn bonds, which have poor statistics in small-scale AIMD simulations. We demonstrate that the MLMD simulations are 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than AIMD. The training dataset and the fitted GAP potentials for ITO and In2O3 are openly accessible.</description>

      <title>Observation of robust macroscale structural superlubricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural superlubricity (SSL) promises nearly frictionless and wearless sliding, but has until now been considered a special and extreme interfacial phenomenon limited to micro- and nanoscale contacts. Here, we demonstrate robust macroscale SSL within a single sub-millimeter graphite contact. Previously reported near-zero friction coefficients, where friction is nearly independent of normal load, have only been observed at microscale contacts under low loads. Our system expands both contact size and load into the macroscopic regime, exhibiting friction coefficients that fluctuate around zero and reach values as low as $10^{-6}$ across a broad load range from 1 mN to 0.5 N. Negative friction coefficients are also observed. Similar behavior is observed at graphite/MoS$_2$ interfaces, indicating that macroscale SSL is a generalizable phenomenon across flat layered materials. These findings overturn long-standing scaling limitations and establish macroscale SSL as a paradigm-shifting platform for next-generation mechanical and electromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Sample thickness dependence of structural and magnetic properties in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered transition metal trihalide $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has been studied extensively in recent years as a promising candidate for a proximate Kitaev quantum spin liquid state. In high quality samples, a complete structural transition from room-temperature C2/m to low-temperature R$\bar{3}$ is consistently observed, with a single magnetic transition to antiferromagnetic ordering at $\sim$7K. However, magnetic and physical properties have been shown to depend heavily on both sample size and sample quality, with small and damaged samples exhibiting incomplete structural transitions and multiple magnetic anomalies. Although large high quality samples have been well studied, an understanding of the features attributed to low quality or small sample size is limited. Here, we probe the structural and magnetic transitions of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ single crystal samples via magnetic susceptibility through a range of thickness, manipulated through careful mechanical exfoliation. We present a non-destructive protocol for exfoliating crystals and show success to 30 $\mu$m, where sample quality is observed to improve with successive cleaving. Higher temperature magnetic features at 10 K/12 K are found to emerge through cleaving, both with and without induced sample damage. In both cases, we link these additional magnetic features to a persistence of C2/m structure to the low-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Dense Ultrafine-Grained MoW, MoWNb, and MoWNbTa Alloys: Influence of Cobalt Doping on Sintering and Grain Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense ultrafine-grained (UFG) refractory MoW, MoWNb, and MoWNbTa alloys were fabricated by combining high-energy ball milling (HEBM) and spark plasma sintering (SPS), achieving ~92-96% relative densities and ~70-180 nm grain sizes. The effects of 2 at.% cobalt (Co) addition on sintering behavior and high-temperature grain growth resistance were investigated as a function of compositional complexity. Activated sintering was observed, with 2 at.% Co addition increasing relative densities from ~92-96% to ~96-98%. Isothermal grain growth experiments at 1200 {\deg}C and 1300 {\deg}C showed that Co doping suppressed the relative grain growth rate, despite a modest initial grain size increase due to Co-activated sintering, with the effect becoming more pronounced in compositionally complex alloys. The observed trend is consistent with the recently proposed high-entropy grain boundary (HEGB) effect. Notably, Mo24.5W24.5Nb24.5Ta24.5Co2 achieved a 96.4% relative density and maintained an ultrafine grain size, increasing only slightly from ~122 nm to ~127 nm after 5 h annealing at 1200 {\deg}C. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed strong Co segregation at grain boundaries, accompanied by minor depletion of Ta and W, supporting a recently proposed grain boundary segregation model for high-entropy alloys and HEGBs.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of stress tensor around single dislocation in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations are fundamental crystal defects whose stress fields govern a wide range of material properties. The analytical form of the stress tensor around single dislocation was established by elasticity theory more than 80 years ago and has provided a theoretical basis for evaluating essential characteristics of dislocations. However, direct experimental verification has long remained out of reach because it has been difficult to measure the components of the stress tensor with conventional methods. Here, we present the experimental visualization of the stress tensor around single dislocation in diamond. Using quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, we mapped the shear components ($\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{yz}$, $\sigma_{zx}$) together with the trace of the stress tensor ($\sigma_{xx}+\sigma_{yy}+\sigma_{zz}$) around single 45{\deg} dislocation. The observed distributions exhibited good agreement with predictions from elasticity theory, thus providing experimental validation of this theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>High-pressure structural and lattice-dynamics study of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural evolution of two selected compositions of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), with 3mol% (3YSZ) and 8mol% (8YSZ) of Y2O3, have been investigated under pressure using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell up to 40 GPa (at room temperature).The close crystallographic relation between the observed structures and the relatively large difference in the atomic numbers of Y/Zr and O, imposes the simultaneous study using both techniques, aiming to fully elucidate the structural evolution under pressure. The results, by combining both techniques, reveal that for both 3YSZ and 8YSZ, pressure promotes higher-symmetry structures. Under initial compression, the minority at ambient conditions monoclinic phase (m-phase) gradually transforms towards t-phase, a transition that is concluded for both 3YSZ/8YSZ at ~10 GPa. At higher pressures, the solely remaining t-phase of 3YSZ transforms to the t'', that in turns transforms to the c-phase above 28 GPa. Likewise, for 8YSZ the coexistence of t- and t''-phases continue up to 31 GPa, where both transforms towards c-phase, that remains stable up to the highest pressure of this study. Upon pressure release, all observed transitions are fully reversible with negligible hysteresis, with the exception of the practical disappearance of the monoclinic phase at ambient conditions. Our study underscores the significance of simultaneously performing and analyzing the results of both XRD and Raman spectroscopy studies in relevant crystallographic systems. Moreover, it provides a route towards a ``structural purification'' of YSZ through the elimination of the m-phase aiming to improve material properties.</description>

      <title>Tiling by Near Coincidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e patterns of twisted and scaled bilayers have recently emerged as a fertile source of quasiperiodic order in two-dimensional materials. Inspired by these systems, we introduce the \emph{near-coincidence method} for generating quasiperiodic tilings of the plane. The method is intuitive -- admitting pairs of nearly coincident points from superimposed layers -- yet rigorous, as it maps naturally to the well-established cut-and-project formalism. It reproduces classical tilings, including the Ammann--Beenker, the Niizeki--G\"ahler, and the square and hexagonal Fibonacci tilings. It also uncovers new tilings not likely to arise in conventional constructions, with relative frequencies of local configurations that may take transcendental values. The near-coincidence method is algorithmically simple and already realized in an application that generates tilings from specified layer parameters and coincidence conditions. Future extensions include trilayer systems, where preliminary results yield dodecagonal order with square layers, and very small twist angles, where the method may capture the giant moir\'e patterns of bilayer and trilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Engineering Ideal 2D Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals via Stacking and Intercalation of van der Waals Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional type-II topological semimetals (TSMs), characterized by strongly tilted Dirac cones, have attracted intense interest for their unconventional electronic properties and exotic transport behaviors. However, rational design remains challenging due to the sensitivity of band tilting to lattice geometry, atomic coordination, and symmetry constraints. Here, we present a bottom-up approach to engineer ideal type-II nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) in van der Waals bilayers via atomic intercalation. Using monolayer $h$-AlN as a prototype, we show that fluorine-intercalated bilayer AlN (F@BL-AlN) hosts a symmetry-protected type-II nodal loop precisely at the Fermi level, enabled by preserved mirror symmetry ($\mathcal{M}_z$) and tailored interlayer hybridization. First-principles calculations reveal that fluorine not only tunes interlayer coupling but also aligns the Fermi energy with the nodal line, stabilizing the type-II NLSM phase. The system exhibits tunable electronic properties under external electric and strain fields and features a van Hove singularity that induces spontaneous ferromagnetism, realizing a ferromagnetic topological semimetal state. This work provides a versatile platform for designing type-II NLSMs and offers practical guidance for their experimental realization.</description>

      <title>Thermal History-Dependent Coalescence Mechanisms and Sintering Dynamics in Al-6.8%Cu Nanopowders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aluminum-Copper (Al-Cu) alloys are essential materials for weight reduction critical structures in the aerospace and automotive industries, yet achieving their maximum ultrahigh-strength potential remains limited by nanoscale defect control during powder metallurgy processing. We employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Al-6.8%Cu nanoparticles to explore atomic-scale mechanisms governing the full thermal sintering cycle. We demonstrate that while the sintering temperature primarily initiates neck formation, the subsequent cooling rate is the dominant kinetic parameter dictating the final microstructure. Fast cooling rates trap a significantly higher density of stacking faults and can unexpectedly lead to the formation of an amorphous phase at the interparticle interfaces, a feature critically dependent on the rate of thermal dissipation. We confirm a clear shift in the coalescence mechanism from plastic deformation (dislocation slip) at low temperatures (300 K and 450 K) to mass transport via atomic diffusion at high temperatures (600 K). These findings provide essential, atomic-scale guidelines for controlling thermal processing, particularly cooling rates, to design defect-stabilized, high-performance Al-Cu components.</description>

      <title>Doping induced itinerant ferromagnetism and enhanced ferroelectricity in BL-InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in solids remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, with far-reaching implications for multifunctional materials and next-generation electronic devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict emergent sliding ferroelectricity and doping-mediated ferromagnetism in bilayer (BL) InSe. The energetically favored AB stacked BL-InSe spontaneously breaks the out-of-plane mirror symmetry, resulting in a switchable polarization with a saturated component of 0.089 pC/m and a low transition barrier of 28.8 meV per unit cell. Strikingly, low-concentration electrostatic doping enhances rather than suppresses the ferroelectric polarization due to the abnormal layer-dependent electronic occupation in BL-InSe, in contrast to the conventional screening paradigm. In addition, the characteristic Mexican-hat-shaped valence band enables doping-induced itinerant half-metallic ferromagnetism, where the interlayer spin density difference scales linearly with doping concentration and can be reversed by switching the polarization direction. These results demonstrate the coexistence of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders in BL-InSe and establish a viable platform for realizing voltage-tunable multiferroicity through stacking and carrier doping in otherwise nonpolar and nonmagnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cobalt-free high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered interest for nuclear structural applications due to their good mechanical performance, thermal stability, and resistance to radiation-induced degradation, while avoiding long-lived Co radioisotopes. This study presents an experimental and computational investigation of the plastic deformation behavior of a non-equatomic CrMnFeNi alloy, designed to maintain a stability of fcc phase in a large domain of temperatures and to balance stacking fault (SF) energies for enhanced strain hardening and ductility. Tensile tests reveal a temperature-dependent reduction in mechanical strength, attributed to thermally activated deformation mechanisms and microstructural evolution. Molecular dynamics simulations of single- and polycrystals capture dislocation activity, SF formation, and twin nucleation as a function of strain and temperature. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) confirms twin formation and grain boundary activity. The Schmid factor mapping is drawn to interpret local slip activity and anisotropic deformation behavior. The absence of Co leads to enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Cantor alloy.</description>

      <title>Electronic-Entropy-Driven Solid-Solid Phase Transitions in Elemental Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the thermodynamic phase diagram of seventeen elemental metals with hexagonal close-packed (hcp), face-centered cubic (fcc), and body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structures using finite-temperature density functional theory. Helmholtz free-energy differences between competing hcp, fcc, and bcc phases are evaluated as functions of electronic temperature up to 7 eV, allowing us to identify solid-solid phase transitions driven by electronic entropy. The systems studied include Zr, Ti, Cd, Zn, Co, and Mg (hcp), Ni, Cu, Ag, Al, Pt, and Pb (fcc), and Cr, W, V, Nb, and Mo (bcc) in their ground-state structures. From the free-energy crossings, we extract the transition electronic temperatures and analyze systematic trends across the metallic systems. We found that all the studied systems go through one or two solid-solid phase transition caused purely by electronic entropy except Mg and Pb. Our results establish electronic entropy as a key factor governing structural stability in metals under strong electronic excitation.</description>

      <title>Carbogels for sustainable and scalable thermoelectric applications</title>

Abstract: Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) based on commercially used thermal super-insulating materials can facilitate sustainable and large-scale ambient waste heat recovery while bequeathing an added economic and environmental value to thermal insulations in industry. This requires the optimization of the thermoelectric (TE) properties through electrical functionalization of such materials. Moreover, the associated engineering challenges of assembling TEG modules must be overcome. Herein, we propose using super-insulating Resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) carbogels for scalable and sustainable TE applications through their electrical functionalization. Using a combination of a pyrolysis process and carbon fibers insertion, we achieved an increment by 12 orders of magnitude in electrical conductivity as well as ZT whilst retaining their intrinsic ultralow thermal conductivity (&lt;50 mW/mK). A TE module in the form of a thermoelectric vacuum insulation panel (TVIP), was then fabricated using only a p-type material, to demonstrate a proof-of-concept self-powered WiFi-based vacuum-failure detection application in confined spaces in automobiles or aeronautics. Finally, by extrapolating the optimized output power and with a CAD-assisted assembly of a large TEG module (1000 cm2), the potential of scalable low-grade waste heat recovery is discussed.</description>

      <title>New RVE concept in thermoelasticity of periodic composites subjected to compact support loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for linear thermoelastic composites (CMs) with periodic microstructures. The approach is based on an exact new Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), formulated for compactly supported loading conditions, such as body forces and localized thermal effects (for example laser heating). In addition, new general integral equations (GIEs) are established for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading. A unified iterative scheme is developed for solving the static AGIEs, where the compact support of loading serves as a new fundamental training parameter. At the core of the methodology lies a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept that extends Hill classical definition of the RVE. Unlike conventional RVEs, this generalized RVE is not fixed geometrically but emerges naturally from the characteristic scale of localized loading, thereby reducing the analysis of an infinite periodic medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This formulation automatically filters out nonrepresentative subsets of effective parameters while eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite-size sample dependencies. Furthermore, the AGIE-based CAM framework integrates seamlessly with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, supporting the development of accurate, physics-informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an enhanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for the analysis of linear thermoelastic composite materials (CMs) with random microstructure. The proposed approach is grounded in an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), specifically formulated for compactly supported loading, including both body forces and localized thermal changes (such as those from laser heating). New general integral equations (GIEs) for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading are proposed. A unified iterative solution strategy is developed for the static AGIE, applicable to CMs with both perfectly and imperfectly bonded interfaces, where the compact support of loading is introduced as a new fundamental training parameter. Central to this methodology is a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill classical definition. The resulting RVE is not predefined geometrically, but rather emerges from the characteristic scale of the localized loading, effectively reducing the analysis of an infinite, randomly heterogeneous medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This generalized RVE approach enables automatic exclusion of unrepresentative subsets of effective parameters, while inherently eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite size limitations. Moreover, the AGIE-based CAM framework is naturally compatible with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, facilitating the construction of accurate and physically informed surrogate nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Probing the magnetic ground state and magnetoelastic coupling in double perovskite ruthenate: Ca2ScRuO6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ruthenates, materials with a single magnetic Ruthenium (Ru) atom, often display an exotic array of ground states ranging from superconductivity to altermagnetism. In this work, we investigated the magnetic ground state of a least explored member of the 4d3 double perovskite ruthenate series A2ScRuO6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba): Ca2ScRuO6. Interestingly, temperature-dependent bulk susceptibility curve shows ferrimagnetic-like behaviour above the magnetic ordering at around 40 K, which were corroborated by the identification of the mixed valence states, Ru5+ and Ru4+ via X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Structural analysis further revealed atomic-site exchange between the Ru and Sc sites, which results in the Ru mixed valence states. Neutron powder diffraction measurements detected the presence of magnetic Bragg peaks at a low temperature near 4 K and a moderate magnetoelastic coupling near the ordering temperature of 40 K. However, the corresponding symmetry analysis shows a weak Type I antiferromagnetic ground state with a reduced magnetic moment of 1.1{\mu}B/Ru atom. Our findings establish an unusual magnetic ground state in the Mott insulating Ca2ScRuO6, where a long range ordered antiferromagnet coexists with small magnetic clusters, which manifests a ferrimagnetic-like high temperature inverse magnetic susceptibility. This system presents a unique platform to study long-range magnetic order in the presence of antisite disorder.</description>

      <title>Nanocrystal Geometry Governs Phase Transformation Pathways in Palladium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathways and structural dynamics of phase transformations impact performance of materials in energy and information storage technologies. Palladium hydride ($\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $\alpha$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected by the confined geometry of a nanocrystal. However, how nanocrystal geometry influences phase transformation pathways is largely unknown. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize hydrogenation in Pd nanocrystals with two geometries -- a nanocube and a hexagonal nanoplate. Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $\alpha/\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\{100\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces. Theoretical simulations show that geometry determines the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways as the system is driven far from equilibrium during hydrogenation. These findings identify geometry as a fundamental parameter for directing phase transformation pathways, offering design principles for accessing atypical configurations and improving properties of intercalation-based devices.</description>

      <title>Random phase approximation-based local natural orbital coupled cluster theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical applications of fragment embedding and closely related local correlation methods critically depend on a judicious choice of a low-level theory to define the local embedding subspace and to capture long-range electrostatic and correlation effects outside the embedding region. Second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) is by far the most widely used correlated low-level theory; however, its applicability becomes questionable in systems where MP2 is known to fail either quantitatively or qualitatively. In this work, we present the random phase approximation (RPA) as a promising alternative low-level theory to MP2 within the local natural orbital-based coupled-cluster (LNO-CC) framework. We demonstrate that RPA-based LNO-CC closely matches the performance of its MP2-based counterpart for systems with sizable energy gaps, while delivering significantly faster convergence toward the canonical coupled-cluster limit for metallic systems, particularly as the thermodynamic limit is approached. These results highlight the critical role of the low-level theory in fragment embedding and local correlation methods and identify RPA as a compelling alternative to the commonly used MP2.</description>

      <title>Multispectral UV Imaging on Capacitive CMOS Arrays Enabled by Solution-Processed Metal-Oxide Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) imagers are important for a variety of applications, such as quality inspection in the semiconductor industry, forensics and food quality inspection, but are often costly because they require dedicated semiconductor process flows. Here, an imaging chip is introduced that has been fabricated using standard 40 nm complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technology. Instead of using a conventional charge-based photodetection principle, the imager uses a capacitive operation principle where UV-light causes capacitance changes via the photodielectric effect in a functionalization layer, which are measured by the underlying CMOS circuitry. This spin-coated or inkjet-printed functionalization layer consists of solution-processed, wide-bandgap, semiconducting metaloxide nanoparticles, and facilitates multispectral imaging. The sensors exhibit low noiseequivalent powers (17-138 fW Hz^-1/2) across the UV bands. Unlike conventional silicon CMOS imagers, the present capacitive-CMOS platform is inherently visible-blind, providing selective UV detection. This work positions late-functionalized capacitive-CMOS arrays as a route toward reducing the cost of UV imagers, which can lead to their more widespread implementation in consumer and low-volume application-specific products.</description>

      <title>Coupled thermo-chemo-mechanical phase field-based modelling of hydrogen-assisted cracking in girth welds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new computational framework is presented to predict the structural integrity of welds in hydrogen transmission pipelines. The framework combines: (i) a thermo-mechanical weld process model, and (ii) a coupled deformation-diffusion-fracture phase field-based model that accounts for plasticity and hydrogen trapping, considering multiple trap types, with stationary and evolving trap densities. This enables capturing, for the first time, the interplay between residual stresses, trap creation, hydrogen transport, and fracture. The computational framework is particularised and applied to the study of weld integrity in X80 pipeline steel. The focus is on girth welds, as they are more complex due to their multi-pass nature. The weld process model enables identifying the dimensions and characteristics of the three weld regions: base metal, heat-affected zone, and weld metal, and these are treated distinctively. This is followed by virtual fracture experiments, which reveal a very good agreement with laboratory studies. Then, weld pipeline integrity is assessed, estimating critical failure pressures for a wide range of scenarios. Of particular interest is to assess the structural integrity implications of welding defects present in existing natural gas pipelines under consideration for hydrogen transport: pores, lack of penetration, imperfections, lack of fusion, root contraction, and undercutting. The results obtained in hydrogen-containing environments reveal an important role of the weld microstructure and the detrimental effect of weld defects that are likely to be present in existing natural gas pipelines, as they are considered safe in gas pipeline standards.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A defining quantity of a physical system is its energy which is represented by the Hamiltonian. In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, systems are a special class of non-Hermitian ones. They describe open systems but may still have real energy spectrum. The eigenmodes are however not orthogonal in general. This qualitative difference to Hermitian physics has a range of consequences for the physical behaviour of the system in the steady state or when it is subjected to external perturbations. This overview reviews the recent progress in the field of pseudo-Hermitian physics as it unfolds when applied to low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. The focus is mainly on long wave length spin excitations (spin waves) with magnons being the energy quanta of these excitations. Various setups including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, magnonic crystals, and hybride structures with different types of coupling to the environments as well as spatio-temporally engineered systems will be discussed with a focus on the particular aspects that are brought about by the pseudo-Hermiticity such as mode amplifications, non-reciprocal propagation, magnon cloaking, non-Hermitian skin effect, PT-symmetric assisted Floquet engineering, topological energy transfer, and field-induced enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spectral Singularities and Topological Lasers in PT-Symmetric Weyl Semimetals</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the unique properties of PT-symmetric Topological Weyl Semimetals (TWS) within the framework of non-Hermitian physics, focusing on their potential for generating topological lasers. By exploring the role of spectral singularities and their relationship to exceptional points, we examine how these materials, characterized by Weyl nodes and topologically protected surface states, can support novel optical phenomena such as unidirectional propagation and enhanced lasing. Through a theoretical model based on the transfer matrix approach, we reveal how the interplay between the PT symmetry and the axion term introduces new dynamics, leading to 12 distinct topological laser configurations. The study also investigates the impact of the $\theta$-term on spectral singularities, showing how it quantizes the system's gain values and influences the topological properties of the lasers. By applying our model to the TaAs material, a known Weyl semimetal, we uncover previously unreported effects, demonstrating the potential of PT-symmetric TWS materials for advanced optoelectronic applications. We show that the axion-induced cyclotron-like Hall current in a PT-symmetric TWS medium, revealing its topological characteristics and distinct flow patterns in the gain and loss regions, which serve as indicators of the system's topological symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for the development of robust, tunable, and efficient topological lasers with applications in quantum information processing and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Here, we present a systematic first-principles study of hydrogen adsorption on pristine and Janus MX2 and MSSe monolayers (M = Ni, Pd, Pt; X = S, Se), combining density-functional theory (DFT) calculations with finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD). Orbital-resolved electronic-structure analysis reveals that hydrogen binding strength is controlled primarily by the contribution of metal d states near the Fermi level, which increases from Pd and Pt to Ni. Chalcogen substitution from S to Se further modulates adsorption by enhancing surface polarizability. Structure plays a decisive role: metallic 1T phases promote stronger single-molecule adsorption due to enhanced electronic screening, whereas the more open coordination of the 2H phase provides greater configurational freedom at high hydrogen coverage. Janus functionalization introduces chemically inequivalent S- and Se-terminated surfaces, leading to side-dependent adsorption energies, hydrogen-layer thicknesses, and spatial distributions. Hydrogen uptake remains dominated by molecular physisorption across all systems. Finite-temperature AIMD simulations at 300 K demonstrate that hydrogen remains molecular even at high loadings, with no dissociation or irreversible chemisorption. 2H-NiSSe and 2H-PdSSe exhibit the most favorable combination of moderate adsorption energies, stable multilayer hydrogen configurations, and robust thermal stability, whereas Pt-based Janus systems display strong confinement and reduced reversibility. These results establish clear design principles for hydrogen storage in TMDs, showing that optimal performance arises from intermediate physisorption rather than maximal binding strength and highlighting Janus Ni- and Pd-based systems as promising platforms for reversible molecular hydrogen storage.</description>

      <title>Accurate Screening of Functional Materials with Machine-Learning Potential and Transfer-Learned Regressions: Heusler Alloy Benchmark</title>

Abstract: A machine learning-accelerated high-throughput (HTP) workflow for the discovery of magnetic materials is presented. As a test case, we screened quaternary and all-$d$ Heusler compounds for stable compounds with large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ($E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$). Structure optimization and evaluation of formation energy and distance to hull convex were performed using the eSEN-30M-OAM interatomic potential, while local magnetic moments, phonon stability, magnetic stability, and $E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$ were predicted by eSEM models trained on our DxMag Heusler database. A frozen transfer learning strategy was employed to improve accuracy. Candidate compounds identified by the ML-HTP workflow were validated with density functional theory, confirming high predictive precision. We also benchmark the performance of different uMLIPs, discuss the fidelity of local magnetic moment prediction, and demonstrate generalization to unseen elements via transfer learning from a universal interatomic potential.</description>

      <title>Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amorphous interfacial complexions have been shown to restrict grain growth and improve damage tolerance in nanocrystalline alloys, with increased chemical complexity stabilizing the complexions themselves. Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves.</description>

      <title>Coulomb drag driven electron-hole bifluidity in doped graphene</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the notion that a preponderance of Coulomb interactions might lead to hydrodynamics, we carry out an ab initio calculation of the charge carrier transport properties of the electron-hole plasma of doped graphene. We include both the phonon and Coulomb interactions within a momentum and band resolved Boltzmann transport formalism. We find that, under suitable conditions, the strong Coulomb drag effect induces effects like negative conductivity and joint electron-hole hydrodynamics (bifluidity) in the plasma. We also identify the exclusive electron or hole hydrodynamics. We find that there is a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the low doped regimes. Our work elucidates the roles of the microscopic scattering mechanisms that drive these hydrodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced phase heterogeneity and charge localization in SnSe</title>

Abstract: Time-resolved multi-terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is used to observe pump fluence-dependent dynamics in the optical conductivity of photoexcited tin selenide (SnSe) over an ultrabroadband spectral range of 0.5 - 11 THz at fluences from 0.1 - 7.5 mJ/cm$^2$. At pump fluences below 3 mJ/cm$^2$, we observe a free carrier Drude spectrum and broad phonon resonances typical of a photoexcited semiconductor. With increasing fluence, a suppression of the DC photoconductivity is observed, indicating an interruption of long range transport due to phase disorder. Concomitantly, the c-axis polarized $B^2_{1u}$ optical phonon narrows and blueshifts, consistent with a transition to a higher symmetry structure. At intermediate fluences of 3.1 mJ/cm$^2$, a high frequency Lorentzian component appears that red shifts on a 50 ps time scale, where a Drude spectrum is eventually restored. Our results provide evidence for a non-thermal, photo-induced nucleation of higher symmetry, semi-metallic phase domains in SnSe appearing within 200 fs with the system relaxing back to its homogeneous $Pnma$ semiconducting phase on a 200 ps time scale.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Methods for the Investigation of Temperature-Dependence in Conductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature-dependent transport data, including diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivities, are routinely analysed by fitting empirical models such as the Arrhenius equation. These fitted models yield parameters such as the activation energy, and can be used to extrapolate to temperatures outside the measured range. Researchers frequently face challenges in this analysis: quantifying the uncertainty of fitted parameters, assessing whether the data quality is sufficient to support a particular empirical model, and using these models to predict behaviour at extrapolated temperatures. Bayesian methods offer a coherent framework that addresses all of these challenges. This tutorial introduces the use of Bayesian methods for analysing temperature-dependent transport data, covering parameter estimation, model selection, and extrapolation with uncertainty propagation, with illustrative examples from molecular dynamics simulations of superionic materials.</description>

      <title>Temperature and Pressure Dependent Vibrational Properties of Pristine and Doped Vacancy-Ordered Double Perovskite</title>

Abstract: Understanding lattice dynamics and structural transitions in vacancy-ordered double perovskites is crucial for developing lead-free optoelectronic materials, yet the role of dopants in modulatingthese properties remains poorly understood. We investigate the vibrational and optical properties of pristine and Antimony(Sb)-doped Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$ vacancy-ordered double perovskite through temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy (4-273 K), high-pressure studies (0- \~30 GPa), ambient powder XRD, and photoluminescence measurements. Sb doping improves phase purity, reducing impurity-related Raman modes present in pristine samples. Most notably, Sb-doped samples exhibit an anomalous Raman mode M$_1$ appearing exclusively below 100 K at 314-319 cm$^{-1}$, accompanied by changes in the temperature coefficient $\chi$ and anharmonic constant $A$ across this threshold. This behavior is absent in pristine Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$. While these observations suggest possible structural changes at low temperature, the origin of the M$_1$ mode remains unclear and may arise from disorder-activated vibrations, symmetry breaking, or dopant-induced local distortions. Low-temperature structural characterization is needed to confirm the nature of this transition. Photoluminescence shows broad self-trapped exciton emission at 448 nm with broader FWHM in Sb-doped samples (164.73 nm) compared to Bi-doped samples (138.2 nm), consistent with enhanced structural disorder. High-pressure Raman measurements reveal continuous mode hardening to 30 GPa with no phase transitions. These results demonstrate that Sb doping modulates the vibrational properties of Cs$_2$TiCl$_6$, though further investigation is required to establish the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric mechanisms, whose intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Spin-Valley Coupling in Dirac Material BaMnBi2 Probed by Quantum Hall Effect and Nonlinear Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Valleytronics is a rapidly advancing field that explores the use of the valley degree of freedom in electronic systems to encode and process information. It relies on electronic states with spin valley locking, first predicted and observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS2. However, very few bulk materials have been reported to host spin valley locked electronic states. In this work, we present experimental evidence for a predicted, unique spin valley locked electronic state generated by Bi zigzag chains in the layered compound BaMnBi2. We observe remarkable quantum transport properties in this material, including a stacked quantum Hall effect (QHE) and a nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). From the analysis of the QHE, we identify a spin valley degeneracy of four, while the NLHE provides supporting evidence for the anticipated valley contrasted Berry curvature, a typical signature of a spin valley locked state. This spin valley locked state contrasts with that observed in the sister compound BaMnSb2, where the degeneracy is two. This difference arises from significant variations in their orthorhombic crystal structures and spin orbit coupling. These findings establish a new platform for exploring coupled spin valley physics in bulk materials and highlight its potential for valleytronic device applications.</description>
