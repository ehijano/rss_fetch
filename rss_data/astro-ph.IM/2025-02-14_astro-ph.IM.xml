      <title>A unified model of feed rotation in radio telescopes and GNSS antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a model that accounts for the phase rotation that occurs when a receiver or transmitter changes orientation while observing or emitting circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. This model extends work detailing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) carrier phase wind-up to allow us to describe the interaction of changing satellite orientation with phase rotation in observing radio telescopes. This development is motivated by, and a critical requirement of, unifying GNSS and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements at the observation level. The model can be used for either stationary choke ring antennas or steerable radio telescopes observing either natural radio sources or satellites. Simulations and experimental data are used to validate the model and to illustrate its importance. In addition, we rigorously lay out the feed rotation correction for radio telescopes with beam waveguide and full Nasmyth focuses and validate the correction by observing the effect with dual polarization observations. Using this feed rotation model for beam waveguide telescopes, we produce the first phase delay solution for the VLBI baseline WARK30M-WARK12M. We provide a practical guide to using the feed rotation model in Appendix D.</description>

      <title>Altitude Estimation of Radio Frequency Interference Sources via Interferometric Near Field Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency interference (RFI) presents a significant obstacle to current radio interferometry experiments aimed at the Epoch of Reionization. RFI contamination is often several orders of magnitude brighter than the astrophysical signals of interest, necessitating highly precise identification and flagging. Although existing RFI flagging tools have achieved some success, the pervasive nature of this contamination leads to the rejection of excessive data volumes. In this work, we present a way to estimate an RFI emitter's altitude using near-field corrections. Being able to obtain the precise location of such an emitter could shift the strategy from merely flagging to subtracting or peeling the RFI, allowing us to preserve a higher fraction of usable data. We conduct a preliminary study using a two-minute observation from the Murchison-Widefield Array (MWA) in which an unknown object briefly crosses the field of view, reflecting RFI signals into the array. By applying near-field corrections that bring the object into focus, we are able to estimate its approximate altitude and speed to be $11.7$ km and $792$ km/h, respectively. This allows us to confidently conclude that the object in question is in fact an airplane. We further validate our technique through the analysis of two additional RFI-containing MWA observations, where we are consistently able to identify airplanes as the source of the interference.</description>

      <title>Some problems of developing astrophysical equipment and combining it with optical telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of a study of the accuracy characteristics and image quality on the SAO RAS optical telescopes, Zeiss-1000 and BTA, using the recently developed "Telescope Analyzer" device are described: a method for determining the coefficients of the pointing correction system, the position of the aberration axis along the coma in images of star fields, natural frequencies of vibrations of mechanical systems, prospects for the development of the device. Attention is paid to the thermal deformations of the BTA main mirror and measures to reduce them. Mention is made of systems being developed for partial correction of wavefront aberrations due to imperfect mechanics, and plans to modernize the control system of the BTA. The complex of 0.5-meter telescopes "Astro-M" has not been forgotten: hardware and software solutions for automating the first and second telescopes, plans for commissioning of telescopes No 3-5 are described. Links to repositories with developed software and hardware products are provided.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Bayesian Sampling for Massive Black Hole Binaries with Prior Constraints from Conditional Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for parameter inference on massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), considering joint observations from a network of three space-based gravitational wave detectors. Our result demonstrates that the trained CVAE model can estimate the posterior distribution of source parameters in approximately 0.5 seconds, while the standard Bayesian sampling method, utilizing parallel computation across 16 CPU cores, takes an average of 22 hours across 25 MBHB signals. While the CVAE model achieves remarkable efficiency, its estimated distributions exhibit slight differences in shape compared to the standard Bayesian results, particularly showing lighter tails with broader widths. By using CVAE result to constrain the prior range for Bayesian sampling, we reduce the sampling time to $14.0\%$ of the original runtime on average, while maintaining similar Bayesian result.</description>

      <title>The EXO-UV program: lastest advances of experimental studies to investigate the biological impact of UV radiation on exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EXO-UV program is an international, interdisciplinary collaboration between astrophysicists and biologists aimed at expanding the characterization of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) environments on exoplanets. This approach combines astrophysical studies with biological experiments to better understand the potential impacts of UVR on exoplanetary surfaces. UVR is particularly relevant because it reaches the surface of planets and can influence their habitability. The specific wavelengths within the UVR spectrum depend on the planet's atmospheric composition and the spectral energy distribution of its host star. Additionally, high UVR fluxes emitted during flares and superflares are of particular interest due to the limited information available regarding their biological impact. The EXO-UV program has successfully led to the first experimental study examining the biological effects of high UVR fluences, such as those produced by flares and superflares. Future experimental studies aim to investigate the biological effects of repetitive flares. In this paper, we review the latest results from our EXO-UV program.</description>

      <title>$\nu$SpaceSim: An end-to-end simulation package to model the sensitivity of UHECR experiments to upward-moving extensive air showers sourced by cosmic neutrinos interacting in the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos act as probes of hadronic processes and offer a distinctive view into their astrophysical origins at high energies. When reaching energies on the PeV scale, $\nu_\tau$ interactions within the Earth can produce a significant flux of $\tau$-leptons. These $\tau$-leptons subsequently decay, generating upward-moving extensive air showers (EAS). Using the Earth as a target for neutrinos and the atmosphere as a signal generator effectively creates a detector with a mass $\gg$ gigaton. $\nu$SpaceSim is a comprehensive simulation developed to model all the relevant physical processes that describe the neutrino-induced, Earth-emergent lepton chain. The simulation models neutrino interactions inside the Earth that produce leptons, the propagation of the leptons through the Earth into the atmosphere, and their decay, forming composite EAS. Next, it models the generation of air optical Cherenkov and radio signals from these showers, including the propagation and attenuation of these signals through the atmosphere, accounting for effects such as clouds and the ionosphere. Finally, the simulation models the detector response according to the parameters defined by the user (such as altitude, effective area, frequency band...). Through this end-to-end simulation, $\nu$SpaceSim aims to help design the next generation of balloon- and space-based experiments, to estimate the exposure of ground-based experiments to these showers, and to understand the data from recent experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 and ANITA.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Stellar Abundances and atmospheric Parameters Pipeline adapted for M dwarfs I. Atmospheric parameters from the spectroscopic module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M dwarfs are important targets in the search for Earth-like exoplanets due to their small masses and low luminosities. Several ongoing and upcoming space missions are targeting M dwarfs for this reason, and the ESA PLATO mission is one of these. In order to fully characterise a planetary system the properties of the host star must be known. For M dwarfs we can derive effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and abundances of various elements from spectroscopic observations in combination with photometric data. The Stellar Abundances and atmospheric Parameters Pipeline (SAPP) has been developed as a prototype for one of the stellar science softwares within the PLATO consortium, it is aimed at FGK stars. We have modified it to be able to analyse the M dwarf among the PLATO targets. The current version of the pipeline for M dwarfs mostly relies on spectroscopic observations. The data processing is based on the machine learning algorithm The Payne and fits a grid of model spectra to an observed spectrum to derive effective temperature and metallicity. We use spectra in the H-band, as the near-infrared region is beneficial for M dwarfs. A method based on synthetic spectra was developed for the continuum normalisation of the spectra, taking into account the pseudo-continuum formed by numerous lines of the water molecule. Photometry is used to constrain the surface gravity. We tested the modified SAPP on spectra of M dwarfs from the APOGEE survey. Our validation sample of 26 stars includes stars with interferometric observations and binaries. We found a good agreement between our values and reference values from a range of studies. The overall uncertainties in the derived effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity is 100 K, 0.1 dex, and 0.15 dex, respectively. We find that the modified SAPP performs well on M dwarfs and identify possible areas of future development.</description>

      <title>Improving early detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars using CNNs and FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) with possible telescope follow-ups opens a window to ground-breaking discoveries in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. With the improved sensitivity of current and future GW detectors, more BNS detections are expected in the future. Therefore, enhancing low-latency GW search algorithms to achieve rapid speed, high accuracy, and low computational cost is essential. One innovative solution to reduce latency is the use of machine learning (ML) methods embedded in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we present a novel WaveNet-based method, leveraging the state-of-the-art ML model, to produce early-warning alerts for BNS systems. Using simulated GW signals embedded in Gaussian noise from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors' third observing run (O3) as a proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate significant performance improvements. Compared to the current leading ML-based early-warning system, our approach enhances detection accuracy from 66.81% to 76.22% at a 1% false alarm probability. Furthermore, we evaluate the time, energy, and economical cost of our model across CPU, GPU, and FPGA platforms, showcasing its potential for deployment in real-time gravitational wave detection pipelines.</description>

      <title>The Blending ToolKit: A simulation framework for evaluation of galaxy detection and deblending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an open source Python library for simulating overlapping (i.e., blended) images of galaxies and performing self-consistent comparisons of detection and deblending algorithms based on a suite of metrics. The package, named Blending Toolkit (BTK), serves as a modular, flexible, easy-to-install, and simple-to-use interface for exploring and analyzing systematic effects related to blended galaxies in cosmological surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). BTK has three main components: (1) a set of modules that perform fast image simulations of blended galaxies, using the open source image simulation package GalSim; (2) a module that standardizes the inputs and outputs of existing deblending algorithms; (3) a library of deblending metrics commonly defined in the galaxy deblending literature. In combination, these modules allow researchers to explore the impacts of galaxy blending in cosmological surveys. Additionally, BTK provides researchers who are developing a new deblending algorithm a framework to evaluate algorithm performance and make principled comparisons with existing deblenders. BTK includes a suite of tutorials and comprehensive documentation. The source code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/BlendingToolKit.</description>

      <title>Call to Protect the Dark and Quiet Sky from Harmful Interference by Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing number of satellite constellations in low Earth orbit (LEO) enhances global communications and Earth observation, and support of space commerce is a high priority of many governments. At the same time, the proliferation of satellites in LEO has negative effects on astronomical observations and research, and the preservation of the dark and quiet sky. These satellite constellations reflect sunlight onto optical telescopes, and their radio emission impacts radio observatories, jeopardising our access to essential scientific discoveries through astronomy. The changing visual appearance of the sky also impacts our cultural heritage and environment. Both ground-based observatories and space-based telescopes in LEO are affected, and there are no places on Earth that can escape the effects of satellite constellations given their global nature. The minimally disturbed dark and radio-quiet sky is crucial for conducting fundamental research in astronomy and important public services such as planetary defence, technology development, and high-precision geolocation. Some aspects of satellite deployment and operation are regulated by States and intergovernmental organisations. While regulatory agencies in some States have started to require operators to coordinate with their national astronomy agencies over impacts, mitigation of the impact of space objects on astronomical activities is not sufficiently regulated. To address this issue, the CPS urges States and the international community to take steps to protect the dark and quiet sky as specified in this paper.</description>

      <title>First Result for Dark Matter Search by WINERED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identity of dark matter has been a mystery in astronomy, cosmology, and particle theory for about a century. Bessho, Ikeda, and Yin (2022), three of the current authors, proposed using the state-of-the-art infrared spectrographs, including WINERED at $6.5$m Magellan Clay telescope and NIRSpec at James Webb Space Telescope, as efficient detectors for the indirect detection of dark matter with the mass around eV by measuring the line photons from the dark matter two body decays. Applying this concept, we have performed spectrographic observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Leo V and Tucana II using WINERED by utilizing an object-sky-object nodding observation technique for background subtraction. We present the first result from this dark matter search. Employing zero consistent flux data after the sky subtraction, we have established one of the most stringent limits to date on dark matter decaying into line photons in the mass range of $1.8-2.7\,$eV. Our data can also be applied to constrain other spectra of photons from the dSphs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, 5 of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

In particular, we determine the properties of the signal -- signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and source parameters -- such that we are led to falsely identify a ppE deviation in the post-Newtonian (PN) inspiral phase at -1PN, 1PN, or 2PN order, due to neglecting spin precession or higher models in the recovery model. To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute the Bayes factor between the ppE and GR models, and the fitting factor of the ppE model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the signal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the ppE parameters, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are characterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the ppE model. At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for the ppE model and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing asymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does not impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis, therefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which parametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear signal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them by obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the effective cycles incurred due to mismodeling. As a by-product of our analysis, we connect various measures and techniques commonly used to estimate systematic errors -- linear-signal approximation, Laplace approximation, fitting factor, effective cycles, and Bayes factor -- that apply to all studies of systematic uncertainties in gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing hole trap production due to proton irradiation in germanium cross-strip detectors</title>

Abstract: We present an investigation into the effects of high-energy proton damage on charge trapping in germanium cross-strip detectors, with the goal of accomplishing three important measurements. First, we calibrated and characterized the spectral resolution of a spare COSI-balloon detector in order to determine the effects of intrinsic trapping, finding that electron trapping due to impurities dominates over hole trapping in the undamaged detector. Second, we performed two rounds of proton irradiation of the detector in order to quantify, for the first time, the rate at which charge traps are produced by proton irradiation. We find that the product of the hole trap density and cross-sectional area, $[n\sigma]_\mathrm{h}$ follows a linear relationship with the proton fluence, $F_\mathrm{p}$, with a slope of $(5.4\pm0.4)\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{cm/p^{+}}$. Third, by utilizing our measurements of physical trapping parameters, we performed calibrations which corrected for the effects of trapping and mitigated degradation to the spectral resolution of the detector.</description>

      <title>The NCORES Program: Precise planetary masses, null results, and insight into the planet mass distribution near the radius gap</title>

Abstract: NCORES was a large observing program on the ESO HARPS spectrograph, dedicated to measuring the masses of Neptune-like and smaller transiting planets discovered by the TESS satellite using the radial velocity technique. This paper presents an overview of the programme, its scientific goals and published results, covering 35 planets in 18 planetary systems. We present spectrally derived stellar characterisation and mass constraints for five additional TOIs where radial velocity observations found only marginally significant signals (TOI-510.01, $M_p=1.08^{+0.58}_{-0.55}M_\oplus$), or found no signal (TOIs 271.01, 641.01, 697.01 and 745.01). A newly detected non-transiting radial velocity candidate is presented orbiting TOI-510 on a 10.0d orbit, with a minimum mass of $4.82^{+1.29}_{-1.26}M_\oplus$, although uncertainties on the system architecture and true orbital period remain. Combining the NCORES sample with archival known planets we investigate the distribution of planet masses and compositions around and below the radius gap, finding that the population of planets below the gap is consistent with a rocky composition and ranges up to a sharp cut-off at $10M_\oplus$. We compare the observed distribution to models of pebble- and planetesimal-driven formation and evolution, finding good broad agreement with both models while highlighting interesting areas of potential discrepancy. Increased numbers of precisely measured planet masses in this parameter space are required to distinguish between pebble and planetesimal accretion.</description>
