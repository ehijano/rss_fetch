      <title>Reconstructive martensitic phase transitions: intermittency, anti-trasformation, plasticity, irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mechanics of temperature-driven reconstructive martensitic transformations in crystalline materials, within the framework of nonlinear elasticity theory. We focus on the prototypical case of the square-hexagonal transition in 2D crystals, using a modular Ericksen-Landau-type strain energy whose infinite and discrete invariance group originates from the full symmetry of the underlying lattice. In the simulation of quasi-static thermally-driven transitions we confirm the role of the valley-floor network in establishing the strain-field transition-pathways on the symmetry-moulded strain energy landscape of the crystal. We also observe the phase change to progress through abrupt microstructure reorganization via strain avalanching under the slow driving. We reveal at the same time the presence of assisting anti-transformation activity, which locally goes against the overall transition course. Both transformation and anti-transformation avalanches exhibit Gutenberg-Richter like heavy-tailed size statistics. A parallel analysis shows agreement of these numerical results with their counterparts in empirical observations on temperature-induced martensitic transformations. The simulation furthermore shows that, in the present case of a reconstructive transformation, strain avalanching mostly involves lattice-invariant shears (LIS). As a consequence, microstructure evolution is accompanied by slip-induced defect nucleation and movement in the lattice. LIS activity also leads to the development of polycrystal grain-like lattice-homogeneity domains exhibiting high boundary segmentation in the body. All these effects ultimately lead to transformation irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Particle Trajectory Prediction in Discrete Element Simulations using a Graph-Based Interaction-Aware Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the applicability of a graph-based interaction-aware trajectory prediction model, originally developed for the transportation domain, to forecast particle trajectories in three-dimensional discrete element simulations. The model and our enhancements are validated at two typical particle simulation use cases: (i) particle flow in a representative unit cell with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) in combination with sinusoidal velocity profile and (ii) shear flow in a representative unit cell with Lees\texttt{-}Edwards boundary conditions (LEBCs). For the models to learn the particle behavior subjected to these boundary conditions requires additional data transformation and feature engineering, which we introduce. Furthermore, we introduce and compare two novel training procedures for the adapted prediction model, which we call position\texttt{-}centric training (PCT) and velocity\texttt{-}centric training (VCT). The results show that the models developed for the transportation domain can be adapted to learn the behavior of particles in discrete element simulations.</description>

      <title>Robust and tunable oxide nanoscrolls for solar-driven H$_2$ generation and storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen gas is a promising alternative to fossil fuels due to its high energy output and environmentally safe byproducts. Various morphologies of photocatalytic materials have been explored for high-efficiency H$_2$ production, for instance, quasi-1D nanoscroll structures that provide larger surface-to-volume ratio. Recently, we predicted layer-by-layer formation of stable oxide nanoscrolls directly from dichalcogenide precursors, eliminating the need for costly formation of two-dimensional oxides for a roll-up synthesis of nanoscrolls. In this study, we evaluate the suitability of those oxide nanoscroll materials MoO$_3$, WO$_3$, PdO$_2$, HfO$_2$, and GeO$_2$ for solar-driven photocatalytic H$_2$ production and storage. Using excited state theory simulations we discern their electronic properties as a function of interlayer scroll spacing and find them to possess electronic properties that are suitable for photocatalysis. Additionally, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations we show that they are also suitable for H$_2$ storage as the nanoscrolls exhibit effective trapping of hydrogen, even in the presence of defects and vacancies in the oxides. This work thus demonstrates the discovery of robust and tunable oxide nanoscrolls as novel materials for advancing solar-driven hydrogen technologies.</description>

      <title>Current-driven collective control of helical spin texture in van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical control of quantum magnetic states is essential in spintronic science. Initial studies on the ferromagnetic state control were extended to collinear antiferromagnets and, more recently, noncollinear antiferromagnets. However, electrical control mechanisms of such exotic magnetic states remain poorly understood. Here, we report the first experimental and theoretical example of the current control of helical antiferromagnets, arising from the competition between collinear antiferromagnetic exchange and interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in new van-der-Waals (vdW) material Ni1/3NbS2. Due to the intrinsic broken inversion symmetry, an in-plane current generates spin-orbit torque that, in turn, interacts directly with the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our theoretical analyses indicate that a weak ferromagnetic order coexists due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, mediating the spin-orbit torque to collectively rotate the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our Ni1/3NbS2 nanodevice experiments produce current-dependent resistance change consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work widens our understanding of the electrical control of helical antiferromagnets and promotes vdW quantum magnets as interesting material platforms for electrical control.</description>

      <title>Pressure Tuning of Layer-hybridized Excitons in Trilayer WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate dynamic pressure tuning (0-6.6 GPa) of layer-hybridized excitons in AB-stacked trilayer WSe$_2$ via diamond-anvil-cell-integrated reflectance spectroscopy. Pressure-controlled interlayer coupling manifests in enhanced energy-level anti-crossings and oscillator strength redistribution, with Stark shift analysis revealing a characteristic dipole moment reduction of 11%. Notably, the hybridization strength between the intra- and interlayer excitons triples from $\sim$10 meV to above $\sim$30 meV, exhibiting a near-linear scaling of 3.5$\pm$0.2 meV/GPa. Spectral density simulations resolve four distinct components, i.e., intralayer ground/excited and interlayer ground/excited excitons, with their relative weights transitioning from one component dominant to strongly hybridized at higher pressures. Our findings highlight the potential for controlling excitonic properties and engineering novel optoelectronic devices through interlayer compression.</description>

      <title>Exploring 2D/Quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite A$_{n+1}$Hf$_n$S$_{3n+1}$ (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba; n = 1-3) for Optoelectronics using Many-Body Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality engineering in A$_{n+1}$B$_n$X$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite phases has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance optoelectronic properties. These properties are highly material-dependent, requiring detailed exploration of electronic, optical, excitonic, transport, and polaronic characteristics. However, the absence of comprehensive studies continues to impede the rational design of high-performance materials. In this work, we investigate the excitonic and polaronic effects in A$_{n+1}$Hf$_n$S$_{3n+1}$ (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba; n = 1-3) RP phases, examining their relative stability and optoelectronic properties using several first-principles based methodologies within the framework of density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory (GW and BSE). Our study suggests that these compounds are mechanically stable and feature G$_0$W$_0$@PBE bandgaps ranging from 1.43 to 2.14 eV, which are smaller than those of their bulk counterparts. BSE and model-BSE (mBSE) calculations indicate that these RP phases display notable optical anisotropy, with the exciton binding energy decreasing as the thickness of the perovskite layer increases. In addition, intermediate to strong carrier-phonon scattering is observed in these compounds, confirmed through the Fr\"ohlich mechanism near room temperature. Using the Feynman polaron model, the polaron parameters of these RP phases are also computed, and it is found that charge-separated polaronic states are less stable than bound excitons. Finally, a significant increase in electron mobilities is observed in RP phases compared to their bulk counterparts. Overall, the insights gained from this study will enable the rational design of layered perovskite phases for applications in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Role of seed layer in growing atomically flat TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films at the wafer scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) are a leading candidate for advanced memory and computing applications. Epitaxial-like growth of chalcogenide thin films at the wafer scale is important to guarantee the homogeneity of the thin film but is challenging with magnetron sputtering, particularly for the growth of phase-change heterostructure (PCH), such as TiTe2/Sb2Te3. In this work, we report how to obtain highly textured TiTe2/Sb2Te3 heterostructure thin films with atomically sharp interfaces on standard silicon substrates. By combining atomic-scale characterization and ab initio simulations, we reveal the critical role of the Sb2Te3 seed layer in forming a continuous Si-Sb-Te mixed transition layer, which provides a wafer-scale flat surface for the subsequent epitaxial-like growth of TiTe2/Sb2Te3 thin film. By gradually reducing the thickness of the seed layer, we determine its critical limit to be ~2 nm. Non-negligible in-plane tensile strain was observed in the TiTe2 slabs due to the lattice mismatch with the adjacent Sb2Te3 ones, suggesting that the chemical interaction across the structural gaps in the heterostructure is stronger than a pure van der Waals interaction. Finally, we outline the potential choices of chalcogenides for atomically flat seed layers on standard silicon substrates, which can be used for wafer-scale synthesis of other high-quality PCM or PCH thin films.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of High-Performance Sr2CoNbO6-delta Double Perovskite for IT-SOFC Cathode Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the transport of oxygen anions in the cathode while maintaining surface stability is essential for improving the performance of intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). This study investigates a novel cathode material candidate, Sr2CoNbO6-delta (SCNO), using density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and experimental characterization. The redox active Co cation at B-site and less reducible Nb cation at the B'-site together enhance both surface stability and electrocatalytic performance. SCNO is observed to have a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies and increased oxygen diffusivity on the surface. The surface stability of SCNO is further improved when simulated under compressive strain due to the GDC electrolyte substrate. These findings offer new insights into controlling Sr segregation in SCNO, contributing to a better understanding of its enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and high surface stability. Subsequently, SCNO was synthesized to evaluate its potential as a cathode material in SOFCs. To assess its performance, symmetric cells with uniform dense thin films of varying thicknesses (40 and 80 nm) were fabricated using the pulsed laser deposition technique. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and distributed relaxation time analysis indicate that bulk oxygen ion diffusion is a limiting factor for the ORR in SCNO. The polarization resistance for the 40 and 80 nm dense thin film symmetric cells ranged between 0.329 - 0.241 ohm cm2 and 1.095 - 0.438 ohm cm2, respectively, within the temperature range of 773 - 973 K in an air atmosphere. The full cell configuration of NiO-GDC|GDC|SCNO demonstrated a significantly high peak power density of 0.633 W/cm2 at 973 K. This theory-guided design and experimental study suggest that SCNO is a promising candidate for IT-SOFC cathode materials.</description>

      <title>Tailoring of charge carriers with deposition temperature in pulsed laser deposited BiFeO3 thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates the structural, topological, electrical and optical properties of pulsed laser deposited polycrystalline BiFeO3 thin films on silicon and glass substrate at varying deposition temperatures ranging from 400 degC to 700 degC. X-ray diffraction confirm rhombohedral phase and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals stoichiometric BiFeO3 films. The optical bandgap of thin films obtained from absorption spectra increases with the substrate temperature. Photoluminescence emission spectrum reveals the defects and Atomic Force Microscopy analysis bring out the surface topography and crystallinity improvement with temperature. The charge transport studies reveal a transition in conductivity from n-type at lower deposition temperature to p-type at higher deposition temperature, attributed to oxygen and bismuth vacancies respectively. The intricate understanding of conductivity tuning and the leaky nature of BiFeO3 thin film opens avenues for applications in nonvolatile memories, particularly neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>$\textit{In situ}$ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy of shock-loaded magnesiosiderite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbonate minerals are important in Earth's system sciences and have been found on Mars and in meteorites and asteroids, highlighting the importance of impacts in planetary processes. While extensively studied under static compression, the behavior of carbonates under shock compression remains underexplored, with no $\textit{in situ}$ X-ray investigations reported so far. Here we investigate natural magnesiosiderite (Fe$_{0.6}$Mg$_{0.4}$CO$_{3}$) under nanosecond laser-driven shock compression at pressures up to 150 GPa, coupled with $\textit{in situ}$ ultrafast synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The interpretation of the experimental spectra is complemented using first-principles absorption cross-section calculations performed on crystalline phases at different pressures and on a dense liquid phase obtained using density functional theory-based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations. Under laser-driven shock compression, the magnesiosiderite crystal phase remains unchanged up to the melt. Under shock reverberation, the absorption spectra show changes similar to those attributed to a high-spin to low-spin transition observed under static compression. At higher pressures, the laser shock induces the formation of CO$_4$ tetrahedral units in the melt. Upon unloading from the shocked state, only a few nanoseconds later, the original magnesiosiderite phase is recovered.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Graphene-like BeO Sheet: A Promising Deep-Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Materials System with Strong and Highly Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with large band gaps and strong and tunable second-harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients play an important role in the miniaturization of deep-ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) devices. Despite the existence of numerous experimentally synthesized 2D materials, none of them have been reported to meet DUV NLO requirements. Herein, to the first time, an experimentally available graphene-like BeO monolayer only formed by NLO-active [BeO3] unit is suggested as a promising 2D DUV NLO material due to its ultrawide band gap (6.86 eV) and a strong SHG effect (\{chi}_"22" ^((2))(2D) = 6.81 {\AA}\times pm/V) based on the first-principles calculations. By applying stacking, strain, and twist engineering methods, several 2D BeO sheets have been predicted, and the flexible structural characteristics endow them with tunable NLO properties. Remarkably, the extremely stress-sensitive out-of-plane \{chi}_"15" ^((2))(2D) and \{chi}_"33" ^((2))(2D) (exceptional 30% change) and the robust in-plane \{chi}_"22" ^((2))(2D) against large strains can be achieved together in AC-, AAC-, AAE, and ACE-stacking BeO sheets under in-plane biaxial strain, exhibiting emergent phenomena uniquely not yet seen in other known 2D NLO materials. Our present results reveal that 2D BeO systems should be a new option for 2D DUV NLO materials.</description>

      <title>Inefficiency of the orbit Hall effect on spin torque in transition metal/ferromagnet bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric field or current induced spin torque is crucial for spintronic devices, for instance the spin-orbit torque MRAM (magnetic random access memory). In this work, we systematically investigate the spin torque in transition metals(TM)/ferromagnets(FM) bilayers by using first-principles calculations. In order to examine the spin and orbital Hall contribution, the studied transition metals includes heavy metal Pt, W, Au as well as light metals Ti, V, Cr, Cu etc. The ferromagnets have been chosen to be CoFe and Ni, with the former being relevant for SOT-MRAM and the latter may exhibit large orbital Hall contribution. We found that in TM/CoFe bilayers with typical 3d and 5d transition metals, the spin torque on CoFe mainly originates from spin Hall mechanism with the magnitude and sign of spin torque efficiency consistent with the spin Hall conductivity. In TM/Ni bilayers, the spin Hall effect in bulk TM and Ni itself are account for the origin of spin torque. In both systems, we do not see effective contribution from orbital Hall effect in transition metals on the spin torque in TM/FM bilayers.</description>

      <title>Direct Summation of the Madelung Constant using Axial Multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct summation method for the Madelung constant calculation is presented where a crystal lattice is constructed from linear arrays of charges or axial multipoles. An array is designed to have vanishing low order electric moments such that its potential at the origin from a distance $r$ decays at least as fast as $r^{-5}$, but preferably as fast as $r^{-13}$. High potential decay rates render the summation absolutely convergent in up to 6 dimensions. Convergence speed increases with higher decay rates. It is also shown that the limit approached by the summation is independent of the growth geometry. Madelung constants for NaCl bulk, surface, and edge lattice points are calculated, as well as on off-lattice points such as interstitial positions and external neighborhoods of surfaces. In addition, bulk CsCl Madelung constant was calculated. In 1D, 2D, and 3D, accuracy of 13 decimal places are attained within 40 nearest neighbor distance from the reference ion.</description>

      <title>LLM-Fusion: A Novel Multimodal Fusion Model for Accelerated Material Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering materials with desirable properties in an efficient way remains a significant problem in materials science. Many studies have tackled this problem by using different sets of information available about the materials. Among them, multimodal approaches have been found to be promising because of their ability to combine different sources of information. However, fusion algorithms to date remain simple, lacking a mechanism to provide a rich representation of multiple modalities. This paper presents LLM-Fusion, a novel multimodal fusion model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to integrate diverse representations, such as SMILES, SELFIES, text descriptions, and molecular fingerprints, for accurate property prediction. Our approach introduces a flexible LLM-based architecture that supports multimodal input processing and enables material property prediction with higher accuracy than traditional methods. We validate our model on two datasets across five prediction tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to unimodal and naive concatenation baselines.</description>

      <title>Ruddlesden-Popper defects act as a free surface: role in formation and photophysical properties of CsPbI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perovskite semiconductor, CsPbI3, holds excellent promise for solar cell applications due to its suitable bandgap. However, achieving phase-stable CsPbI3 solar cells with high power conversion efficiency remains a major challenge. Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) defects have been identified in a range of perovskite semiconductors, including CsPbI3. However, there is limited understanding as to why they form or their impact on stability and photophysical properties. Here we increase the prevalence of RP defects with increased Cs-excess in vapour-deposited CsPbI3 thin films and observe superior structural stability but inferior photophysical properties. Significantly, using electron microscopy, we find that the atomic positions at the planar defect are comparable to those of a free surface, revealing their role in phase stabilisation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the RP planes are electronically benign, however, antisites observed at RP turning points are likely to be malign. We therefore propose that increasing RP planes while reducing RP turning points could offer a breakthrough for improving both phase stability and photophysical performance. The formation mechanism revealed here may well apply more generally to RP structures in other perovskite systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing GaAs/AlGaAs Growth on GaAs (111)B for Enhanced Nonlinear Efficiency in Quantum Optical Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is an optimization of GaAs and Al$_{0.55}$Ga$_{0.45}$As growth on GaAs (111)B substrates with a surface misorientation of 2{\deg} towards [$\bar{2}$11], aiming to enhance surface morphology. For quantum optical metasurfaces (QOMs) the change from (001) growth to (111) growth will increase the efficiency of the nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). This work identifies key factors affecting surface roughness, including the detrimental effects of traditional thermal oxide desorption, which prevented growth of smooth surfaces. A novel Ga-assisted oxide desorption method using Ga flux "pulses" was developed, successfully removing oxides while preserving surface quality. In-situ characterization techniques, including reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and a novel technique called Diffuse Laser Scattering (DLS), were employed to monitor and control the oxide removal process. Mounting quarter wafers with sapphire substrates as optical diffusers improved surface uniformity by mitigating temperature gradients. The uniformity of the growths was clearly visualized by an in-house technique called black box scattering (BBS) imaging. Indium (In) was tested as a surfactant to promote step-flow growth in GaAs, which resulted in atomic-scale flatness with root mean square (RMS) roughness as low as 0.256 nm. In combination with a higher growth temperature, the RMS roughness of Al$_{0.55}$Ga$_{0.45}$As layers was reduced to 0.302 nm. The optimized growth methods achieved acceptable roughness levels for QOM fabrication, with ongoing efforts to apply these techniques to various devices based on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures with (111) orientation.</description>

      <title>Huge Stress-induced Adiabatic Temperature Change in a High-Toughness All-d-metal Heusler Alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastocaloric effect (eCE), referring to the thermal effect triggered by a uniaxial stress, provides a promising and versatile routine for green and high efficient thermal management. However, current eCE materials generally suffer from relatively low eCE and poor mechanical properties, hindering their practical applications. Here, we report a exceptionally huge eCE with a directly measured adiabatic temperature change of up to 57.2 K in a dual-phase all-d-metal Heusler Mn50Ni37.5Ti12.5 polycrystalline alloy, revealing an extra contribution to the latent heat during the stress-induced martensitic transformation from B2 to L10, and breaking the record of adiabatic temperature change for elastocaloric alloys. Moreover, thanks to the combined strengthening effect of d-d hybridization and well-dispersed secondary cubic {\gamma} phase, the alloy can endure a uniaxial stress up to 1760 MPa. Such an abnormal huge eCE is attributed to the combination of the enhanced entropy change associated with a stress-induced B2 to L10 martensitic transformation under higher stress, in contrast with the thermally induced B2 to 5-layer modulated structure one, and the high transformation fraction due to the multi-point nucleation facilitated by the {\gamma} phase dispersed in the main phase. This work provides insight into making full use of the transformation heat to enhance the caloric effect for high-efficient thermal management systems.</description>

      <title>Pre-training Graph Neural Networks with Structural Fingerprints for Materials Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, pre-trained graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed as general models which can be effectively fine-tuned for various potential downstream tasks in materials science, and have shown significant improvements in accuracy and data efficiency. The most widely used pre-training methods currently involve either supervised training to fit a general force field or self-supervised training by denoising atomic structures equilibrium. Both methods require datasets generated from quantum mechanical calculations, which quickly become intractable when scaling to larger datasets. Here we propose a novel pre-training objective which instead uses cheaply-computed structural fingerprints as targets while maintaining comparable performance across a range of different structural descriptors. Our experiments show this approach can act as a general strategy for pre-training GNNs with application towards large scale foundational models for atomistic data.</description>

      <title>Predicting the N\'eel temperatures in general helimagnetic materials: a comparison between mean field theory, random phase approximation, renormalized spin wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical temperature for magnetic order comprises a crucial property of any magnetic material and ranges from a few Kelvin in certain antiferromagnets to 1400 K in ferromagnetic Co. However, the prediction of critical temperatures based on, for example, a spin wave dispersion is in general non-trivial. For ferromagnets and simple collinear antiferromagnets, estimates may be obtained from the Heisenberg model using either renormalized spin wave theory or the Green's function random phase approximation (RPA), but a systematic assessment of the accuracy of such approaches seems to be lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose generalizations of both renormalized spin wave theory and RPA to calculate the critical temperatures of single-$Q$ helimagnetic ground states, which include ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as special cases. We compare the methods to classical Monte Carlo simulations and Mean field theory, using experimental exchange parameters for a wide range of materials; MnO and NiO (single site N\'eel ground states), MnF$_2$ (altermagnet), Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_2$O$_3$ (two site N\'eel states) and Ba$_3$NbFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$ (incommensurate helimagnet). In all cases, we observe that predictions from RPA are in excellent agreement with experimental values and RPA thus constitutes a rather reliable all-purpose method for calculating critical temperatures.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of carriers, coherent acoustic phonons and strain pulses in BiSbTe1.5Se1.5 topological insulator thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We Investigate the ultrafast carrier, coherent acoustic phonons (CAPs), and acoustic strain pulse dynamics in topological insulator BiSbTe1.5Se1.5 (BSTS) thin films of varying thickness using degenerate pump-probe reflection spectroscopy. Here, Sapphire has been chosen as the main substrate due to its maximum acoustic reflectivity at the BSTS-sapphire interface compared to BSTS-GaAs, BSTS-Si, and BSTS-MgO interfaces. For the films with thickness more than twice the penetration depth, the transient reflectivity data predominantly exhibits travelling acoustic strain pulses (TASP) on the top of single-exponential electronic decay (~ 2 ps). In contrast, films with thickness less than penetration depth are dominated by CAPs and a bi exponential electronic background with decay times of ~ 2 ps and ~ 260-380 ps. The observed TASP dynamics are well-described by a theoretical acoustic strain model. Further, to elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms governing the behavior of photo-excited carriers, CAPs, and strain pulses, we performed carrier density and temperature-dependent (7-294 K) studies on BSTS films with thicknesses of 22 nm and 192 nm. In the 22 nm film, the both fast and slow decay processes increase with carrier density at room temperature but decrease with temperature at a carrier density of 1.7*10^{19} cm^{-3}. A detailed analysis suggests that the faster decay arises from electron-phonon scattering and carrier diffusion, while the slower decay likely results from defect-assisted and phonon-assisted recombination. Furthermore, increasing the sample temperature leads to anharmonic decay induced softening of ~ 14 % in the phonon frequency and an anomalous ~ 48 % decrease in the phonon damping parameter due to reduced Dirac surface electron and acoustic phonon scattering.</description>

Abstract: Developing phosphors with narrow photoluminescence emission peaks and high chromatic stability holds significant importance in light-emitting diode (LED) display technologies, where a wide color gamut is essential to achieve the Rec. 2020 specifications. This research focuses on the optical properties of a solid solution: $M^I_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$$M^{III}$P$_3$O$_9$N [$M^I$=Na, K; $M^{III}$=Al, (Al$_{0.75}$Ga$_{0.25}$), (Al$_{0.5}$Ga$_{0.5}$), (Al$_{0.25}$Ga$_{0.75}$), Ga, (Ga$_{0.75}$In$_{0.25}$), (Ga$_{0.5}$In$_{0.5}$)] to understand how the narrow-emitting photoluminescence in K$_3$AlP$_3$O$_9$N:Eu$^{2+}$ can evolve during host structure cation substitution. Photoluminescence measurements at low temperature (15 K) support that Eu$^{2+}$ replaces three crystallographically independent Na$^+$ sites in Na$_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$AlP$_3$O$_9$N, similar to the parent K$^+$ phosphor, but substituting Ga$^{3+}$ and In$^{3+}$ for Al$^{3+}$ leads to a change in Eu$^{2+}$ site preference, narrowing the full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) of the emission peak. The chromatic stability and photoluminescence quantum yield are also enhanced with higher Ga$^{3+}$ content in the host but not with In$^{3+}$. Thermoluminescence analysis indicates the relationship between trap states and the enhanced quantum yield with Ga$^{3+}$ leads to the series' best performance. The analysis of the $M^I_{2.97}$Eu$_{0.015}$$M^{III}$P$_3$O$_9$N series offers insight into the potential method for modulating optical properties with cation substitution in the host structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general recipe to describe topological phase transitions in condensed matter systems with interactions. We show that topological invariants in the presence of interactions can be efficiently calculated by means of a non-Hermitian quasiparticle Hamiltonian introduced on the basis of the Green's function. As an example analytically illustrating the application of the quasiparticle concept, we consider a topological phase transition induced by the short-range electrostatic disorder in a two dimensional system described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. The latter allows us to explicitly demonstrate the change in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and explain the quantized values of the longitudinal conductance in a certain range of the Fermi energy and the disorder strength found previously in numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>A multi-component phase-field model for T1 precipitates in Al-Cu-Li alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the role of elastic and interfacial energies in the shape evolution of T1 precipitates in Al-Cu-Li alloys is investigated using phase-field modeling. We employ a formulation considering the stoichiometric nature of the precipitate phase explicitly, including coupled equation systems for various order parameters. Inputs such as elastic properties are derived from DFT calculations, while chemical potentials are obtained from CALPHAD databases. This methodology provides a framework that is consistent with the derived chemical potentials to study the interplay of thermodynamic, kinetic, and elastic effects on T1 precipitate evolution in Al-Cu-Li alloys. It is shown that diffusion-controlled lengthening and interface-controlled thickening are important mechanisms to describe the growth of T1 precipitates. Furthermore, the study illustrates that the precipitate shape is significantly influenced by the anisotropy in interfacial energy and linear reaction rate, however, elastic effects only play a minor role.</description>

      <title>Giant non-reciprocal band structure effect in a multiferroic material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, may unveil band structures suggestive of complex phenomena and new functionalities. In this Letter, we analyze the band structure of EuO in its multiferroic phase. Using density functional theory calculations and detailed symmetry analysis, we reveal a previously overlooked non-reciprocal band structure effect, where the electronic energy bands exhibit asymmetry along opposite directions with respect to the special points in the Brillouin zone. This effect, which is enabled by spin-orbit coupling, is giant for the top valence Eu $4f$ bands, and can be switched by external electric or magnetic fields. Furthermore, this results in an enhanced bulk photovoltaic effect. Specifically, our predictions indicate the emergence of a large injection current response to linearly polarized light, resulting in a photoconductivity value several orders of magnitude higher than that reported in any other oxide material. Ultimately, this non-reciprocal band structure effect and the associated large bulk photovoltaic response may be general phenomena emerging not just in EuO but also in other multiferroics or magnetoelectrics, potentially providing new cross-functionalities.</description>

      <title>First-principles Hubbard parameters with automated and reproducible workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an automated, flexible framework (aiida-hubbard) to self-consistently calculate Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters from first-principles. By leveraging density-functional perturbation theory, the computation of the Hubbard parameters is efficiently parallelized using multiple concurrent and inexpensive primitive cell calculations. Furthermore, the intersite $V$ parameters are defined on-the-fly during the iterative procedure to account for atomic relaxations and diverse coordination environments. We demonstrate the scalability and reliability of the framework by computing in high-throughput fashion the self-consistent onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ parameters for 115 Li-containing bulk solids. Our analysis of the Hubbard parameters calculated reveals a significant correlation of the onsite $U$ values on the oxidation state and coordination environment of the atom on which the Hubbard manifold is centered, while intersite $V$ values exhibit a general decay with increasing interatomic distance. We find, e.g., that the numerical values of $U$ for Fe and Mn 3d orbitals can vary up to 3 eV and 6 eV, respectively; their distribution is characterized by typical shifts of about 0.5 eV and 1.0 eV upon change in oxidation state, or local coordination environment. For the intersite $V$ a narrower spread is found, with values ranging between 0.2 eV and 1.6 eV when considering transition metal and oxygen interactions. This framework paves the way for the exploration of redox materials chemistry and high-throughput screening of $d$ and $f$ compounds across diverse research areas, including the discovery and design of novel energy storage materials, as well as other technologically-relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Doping-Driven Modulation of Spin-Orbit Coupling, Spin Textures, and Rashba-Edelstein Response in Chiral Tellurium: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral semiconductors such as elemental tellurium (Te) exhibit unconventional spin textures and
  large charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies, yet the influence of doping on these properties remains
  underexplored. Here, we address this gap by investigating how substituting Te with lighter (S,
  Se) or heavier (Sb) elements systematically modifies the spin-orbit-driven phenomena in chiral Te,
  including the band structure, spin Berry curvature, and Rashba-Edelstein response. The objective is
  to determine whether doping strategies can be leveraged to optimize collinear spin textures, enhance
  spin accumulation, and possibly extend spin lifetimes-all crucial aspects for magnet-free spintronics.
  Using density functional theory calculations implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO, combined with
  tight-binding interpolation in PAOFLOW, we map out the doping-dependent electronic states and
  quantify their associated spin transport coefficients. Our findings reveal that lighter dopants shift
  the Fermi level to regions of pronounced spin splitting, thereby increasing the magnitude of spin current conversion, whereas heavier dopants can introduce or remove near-degenerate bands that
  strongly affect spin-orbit coupling. In both scenarios, the fundamental chirality of Te remains
  robust, preserving the radial or "collinear" spin-momentum locking. These results not only confirm
  that doping is a potent and feasible route for tuning spin-orbit phenomena but also offer practical
  guidelines for experimental efforts aiming to engineer chiral semiconductors for spin devices. By
  correlating dopant identity with specific spin-texture enhancements, this study paves the way for
  rationally designing next-generation spintronic components free from external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Investigation of O interstitial diffusion in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$: direct approach via master diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, a promising wide band gap semiconducting material, exhibits complex, anisotropic diffusional characteristics and mass transport behavior as a results of its low symmetry crystal structure. From first-principles calculations combined with master diffusion equations, we determine three-dimensional diffusion tensors for neutral ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$) and 2- charged oxygen interstitials ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$). Systematic exploration of the configurational space identifies stable configurations in these two dominant charge states and their corresponding formation energies. By connecting every pair of low-energy configurations considering both interstitial or interstitialcy hops, we construct three-dimensional diffusion networks and evaluate hopping barriers of all transition pathways in networks. Combining the collection of (i) defect configurations and their formation energies and (ii) the hopping barriers that link them, we construct and solve the master diffusion equations for $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ separately through the Onsager approach, resulting in respective three-dimensional diffusion tensors D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{0}$ and D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{2-}$. Both $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ present the fastest diffusion along the $b$-axis, demonstrating significant anisotropy. The predicted self-diffusivities along [100] and [$\overline{2}01$] align well with previously reported values from isotopically labeled oxygen tracer experiments, highlighting the reliability of the approach in capturing complex diffusion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Growth dynamics of graphene buffer layer formation on ultra-smooth SiC(0001) surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study the growth process of epitaxial graphene on SiC was investigated systematically. The transition from the initial buffer layer growth to the formation of the first monolayer graphene domains was investigated by various techniques: atomic force microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, low energy electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The data show that the buffer layer formation goes along with a simultaneous SiC decomposition which takes place as a rapid step retraction of one specific type of SiC bilayer in good agreement with the step retraction model. Once the buffer layer coverage is completed, the resulting characteristic regular repeating terrace and step height pattern of one and two SiC bilayers turned out to be very stable against further SiC decomposition. The following initial growth of monolayer graphene domains occurs, interestingly, only along the two bilayer high terrace edges. This behavior is explained by a preferential SiC decomposition at the higher step edges and it has some potential for spatial graphene growth control. The corresponding earlier graphene growth on one terrace type can explain the different scanning tunneling spectroscopy nanoscale resistivities on these terraces.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic exciton transport and recombination in single-crystal lead bromide perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photogenerated carrier transport and recombination in metal halide perovskites are critical to device performance. Despite considerable efforts, sample quality issues and measurement techniques have limited the access to their intrinsic physics. Here, by utilizing high-purity CsPbBr3 single crystals and contact-free transient grating spectroscopy, we directly monitor exciton diffusive transport from 26 to 300 K. As the temperature (T) increases, the carrier mobility ({\mu}) decreases rapidly below 100 K wtih a {\mu}~T^{-3.0} scaling, and then follows a more gradual {\mu}~T^{-1.7} trend at higher temperatures. First-principles calculations perfectly reproduce this experimental trend and reveal that optical phonon scattering governs carrier mobility shifts over the entire temperature range, with a single longitudinal optical mode dominating room-temperature transport. Time-resolved photoluminescence further identifies a substantial increase in exciton radiative lifetime with temperature, attributed to increased exciton population in momentum-dark states caused by phonon scattering. Our findings unambiguously resolve previous theory-experiment discrepancies, providing benchmarks for future optoelectronic design.</description>

Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.</description>

      <title>Invariant Tokenization of Crystalline Materials for Language Model Enabled Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of crystal materials generation using language models (LMs). A key step is to convert 3D crystal structures into 1D sequences to be processed by LMs. Prior studies used the crystallographic information framework (CIF) file stream, which fails to ensure SE(3) and periodic invariance and may not lead to unique sequence representations for a given crystal structure. Here, we propose a novel method, known as Mat2Seq, to tackle this challenge. Mat2Seq converts 3D crystal structures into 1D sequences and ensures that different mathematical descriptions of the same crystal are represented in a single unique sequence, thereby provably achieving SE(3) and periodic invariance. Experimental results show that, with language models, Mat2Seq achieves promising performance in crystal structure generation as compared with prior methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Three-Atom-Thick Gold Structures as a Benchmark for Atomic-Scale Calibration of Break-Junction Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth study of electronic transport in atomic-sized gold contacts using Break-Junction (BJ) techniques under cryogenic and ambient conditions. Our experimental results, supported by classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations and ab initio calculations, provide compelling evidence for the formation of three-atom-thick structures in gold nanocontacts under tensile stress. These findings extend previous studies that confirmed the existence of one- and two-atom-thick chains. Beyond identifying these novel atomic configurations, we introduce a fast and robust calibration method for Break-Junction systems, leveraging the characteristic length of these structures to convert piezo displacement into absolute distance in angstroms. Our approach presents a novel and robust method for calibrating atomic distances in atomic conductor systems at both cryogenic and room temperatures. The results also enable the assessment of electrode sharpness, even at room conditions.</description>

      <title>Observation and mitigation of microwave echoes from dielectric defects in Josephson traveling wave amplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amplifying microwave signals with a noise close to the minimum imposed by quantum mechanics is now routinely performed with superconducting quantum devices. In particular, Josephson-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPA) have shown record bandwidth with added noise close to the quantum limit. In this work, we report the appearance of echo signals emitted by JTWPAs driven by trains of high-power pulses exceeding their dynamical range. we explore the case of weak signals generated through high power pulses. By sending a train of such high-power pulses, beyond the 1 dB compression point of such amplifiers, we observe the appearance of echoes, solely due to the JTWPA. These echoes have micro-second coherence and we attribute their origin to microscopic defects in the amplifier dielectric layer. By analyzing the power and the coherence of the echo signal as a function of temperature, we estimate the dielectric loss brought by these defects, and their impact on the JTWPA quantum efficiency. We introduce a mitigation technique (BLAST) to prevent the appearance of these echoes, consisting in an additional high-power tone sent concurrently with each pulse. We demonstrate that it suppresses the spurious defect signals and we recover the typical gain and noise figure within 95% of their low-power values in 300 ns. These results can help to extend the use of JTWPAs in experiments where fast high-power sequences are necessary to generate weak microwave responses from the system under study, and also provide a path towards characterizing in-situ the dielectric losses of these devices.</description>

      <title>Survival of the fastest -- algorithm-guided evolution of light-powered underwater microrobots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on environmental conditions, lightweight soft robots can exhibit various modes of locomotion that are difficult to model. As a result, optimizing their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we study underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. Since soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using physical robots competing to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including several hundred percent increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.</description>

      <title>Cryogen-free low-temperature photoemission electron microscopy for high-resolution nondestructive imaging of electronic phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials exhibit phases such as superconductivity at low temperatures, yet imaging their phase transition dynamics with high spatial resolution remains challenging due to conventional tools' limitations - scanning tunneling microscopy offers static snapshots, while transmission electron microscopy lacks band sensitivity. Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) can resolve band structures in real/reciprocal spaces rapidly, but suffering from insufficient resolution for (near)atomic-scale quantum physics due to the unstable cooling designs. Here, we developed cryogen-free low-temperature PEEM (CFLT-PEEM) achieving 21.1 K stably. CFLT-PEEM attains a record-breaking resolution of 4.48 nm without aberration correction, enabling direct visualization of surface-state distribution characteristics along individual atomic steps. The advancement lies in narrowing the segment of band structures for imaging down to 160 meV, which minimizes the chromatic aberration of PEEM. CFLT-PEEM enables rapid, nondestructive high-resolution imaging of cryogenic electronic structures, positioning it as a powerful tool for physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Zeeman split Kramers doublets in spin-supersolid candidate Na$_{2}$BaCo(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Na$_{2}$BaCo(PO$_{4}$)$_{2}$ is a triangular antiferromagnet that displays highly efficient adiabatic demagnetization cooling (J. Xiang $\textit{et al.}$ Nature ${\bf{625}}$, 270 (2024)) near a quantum critical point at $\mu_{0}H_{c}\sim 1.6$ T, separating a low-field magnetically disordered from a high-field fully polarized ferromagnetic phase. We apply high resolution backscattering neutron spectroscopy in an applied field to study the magnetic excitations near $\mu_{0}H_{c}$. At large fields we observe ferromagnetic fluctuations that gradually transition to being overdamped in energy below $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ where the magnetism is spatially disordered. We parameterize the excitations in the high field polarized phase in terms of coupled Zeeman split Kramers doublets originating from the presence of spin-orbit coupling. On reducing the field, the splitting between the Kramers doublets is reduced and if done adiabatically, provides a mechanism for reducing temperature. On lowering the applied field through the $\mu_{0}H_{c}$ the excitations characterize a textured phase that we suggest is inefficient for cooling. Low temperature disordered frustrated magnets built on Kramers doublets with nearby quantum critical points provide a route for efficient magnetocalorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures exhibit unique physical properties, necessitating efficient and accurate characterization methods. Leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence, we introduce a deep learning-based method for efficiently characterizing heterostructures and 2D materials, specifically MoS2-MoSe2 lateral heterostructures and MoS2 flakes with varying shapes and thicknesses. By utilizing YOLO models, we achieve an accuracy rate of over 94.67% in identifying these materials. Additionally, we explore the application of transfer learning across different materials, which further enhances model performance. This model exhibits robust generalization and anti-interference ability, ensuring reliable results in diverse scenarios. To facilitate practical use, we have developed an application that enables real-time analysis directly from optical microscope images, making the process significantly faster and more cost-effective than traditional methods. This deep learning-driven approach represents a promising tool for the rapid and accurate characterization of 2D materials, opening new avenues for research and development in material science.</description>

      <title>Air-stable lithiation engineering of $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ for direct-bandgap multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its sizable direct bandgap and strong light-matter interactions, the preparation of monolayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ has attracted significant attention and intensive research efforts. However, multilayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ is largely overlooked because of its optically inactive indirect bandgap caused by interlayer coupling. It is highly desirable to modulate and decrease the interlayer coupling so that each layer in multilayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ can exhibit a monolayer-like direct-gap behavior. Here, we demonstrate the nanoprobe fabrication of $\mathrm{Li}_{x}\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$-based multilayers exhibiting a direct bandgap and strong photoluminescence emission from tightly bound excitons and trions. The fabrication is facilitated by our newly developed Li-ion platform, featuring tip-induced Li intercalation, air stability and rewritability. Raman characterizations reveal that controlled Li intercalation effectively transforms multilayer $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ into the stack of multiple monolayers, leading to a 26-fold enhancement of photoluminescence, compared to a monolayer. This intercalation result is different from existing observations of transforming $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ multilayers into metallic phases.</description>

      <title>Periodic Materials Generation using Text-Guided Joint Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have emerged as the prevailing approach for generating novel crystal materials due to their ability to leverage the physical symmetries of periodic material structures. However, current models do not effectively learn the joint distribution of atom types, fractional coordinates, and lattice structure of the crystal material in a cohesive end-to-end diffusion framework. Also, none of these models work under realistic setups, where users specify the desired characteristics that the generated structures must match. In this work, we introduce TGDMat, a novel text-guided diffusion model designed for 3D periodic material generation. Our approach integrates global structural knowledge through textual descriptions at each denoising step while jointly generating atom coordinates, types, and lattice structure using a periodic-E(3)-equivariant graph neural network (GNN). Extensive experiments using popular datasets on benchmark tasks reveal that TGDMat outperforms existing baseline methods by a good margin. Notably, for the structure prediction task, with just one generated sample, TGDMat outperforms all baseline models, highlighting the importance of text-guided diffusion. Further, in the generation task, TGDMat surpasses all baselines and their text-fusion variants, showcasing the effectiveness of the joint diffusion paradigm. Additionally, incorporating textual knowledge reduces overall training and sampling computational overhead while enhancing generative performance when utilizing real-world textual prompts from experts.</description>

      <title>Topological phenomena in artificial quantum materials revealed by local Chern markers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A striking example of frustration in physics is Hofstadter's butterfly, a fractal structure that emerges from the competition between a crystal's lattice periodicity and the magnetic length of an applied field. Current methods for predicting the topological invariants associated with Hofstadter's butterfly are challenging or impossible to apply to a range of materials, including those that are disordered or lack a bulk spectral gap. Here, we demonstrate a framework for predicting a material's local Chern markers using its position-space description and validate it against experimental observations of quantum transport in artificial graphene in a semiconductor heterostructure, inherently accounting for fabrication disorder strong enough to close the bulk spectral gap. By resolving local changes in the system's topology, we reveal the topological origins of antidot-localized states that appear in artificial graphene in the presence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we show the breadth of this framework by simulating how Hofstadter's butterfly emerges from an initially unpatterned 2D electron gas as the system's potential strength is increased, and predict that artificial graphene becomes a topological insulator at the critical magnetic field. Overall, we anticipate that a position-space approach to determine a material's Chern invariant without requiring prior knowledge of its occupied states or bulk spectral gaps will enable a broad array of fundamental inquiries and provide a novel route to material discovery, especially in metallic, aperiodic, and disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Stress, Strain, or Displacement? A Novel Machine Learning Based Framework to Predict Mixed Mode I/II Fracture Toughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of fracture toughness under complex loading conditions, like mixed mode I/II, is essential for reliable failure assessment. This paper aims to develop a machine learning framework for predicting fracture toughness and crack initiation angles by directly utilizing stress, strain, or displacement distributions represented by selected nodes as input features. Validation is conducted using experimental data across various mode mixities and specimen geometries for brittle materials. Among stress, strain, and displacement fields, it is shown that the stress-based features, when paired with Multilayer Perceptron models, achieve high predictive accuracy with R2 scores exceeding 0.86 for fracture load predictions and 0.94 for angle predictions. A comparison with the Theory of Critical Distances (Generalized Maximum Tangential Stress) demonstrates the high accuracy of the framework. Furthermore, the impact of input parameter selections is studied, and it is demonstrated that advanced feature selection algorithms enable the framework to handle different ranges and densities of the representing field. The framework's performance was further validated for datasets with a limited number of data points and restricted mode mixities, where it maintained high accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally efficient and practical, and it operates without any supplementary post-processing steps, such as stress intensity factor calculations.</description>

      <title>Possible quantum spin liquid state of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a recently found two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet without showing magnetic order. We grew high-quality CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals and studied the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity. The dc magnetic susceptibility and magnetization reveal its nature of effective spin-1/2, easy axis anisotropy, and antiferromagnetic spin coupling. The ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility and specific heat data indicate the absence of any phase transition down to 20 mK. The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) at zero magnetic field exhibits a non-zero residual term $\kappa_0/T =$ 0.0056 W/K$^2$m. Although the magnetic field dependence of $\kappa$ is rather weak, the 14 T thermal conductivity shows an essential zero residual term. All these results point to a possible ground state of quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fasteners on the Radar Cross-Section performance of Radar Absorbing Air Intake Duct</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An aircraft consists of various cavities including air intake ducts, cockpit, radome, inlet and exhaust of heat exchangers, passage for engine bay/other bay cooling etc. These cavities are prime radar cross-section (RCS) contributors of aircraft. The major such cavity is air intake duct, and it contributes significantly to frontal sector RCS of an aircraft. The RCS reductions of air intake duct is very important to achieve a low RCS (or stealthy) aircraft configuration. In general, radar absorbing materials (RAM) are getting utilized for RCS reduction of air intake duct. It can also be noticed that a large number of fasteners are used for integration of air intake duct with the aircraft structures. The installation of fasteners on RAS may lead to degradation of RCS performance of air intake. However, no such studies are reported in the literature on the impact of rivets on the RCS performance of RAS air intake duct. In this paper, radar absorbing material of thickness 6.25 mm is designed which givens more than -10 dB reflection loss from 4 to 18GHz of frequencies. Next, the effect of rivet installation on these RAS is carried out using three different rivet configurations. The RCS performance of RAS is evaluated for duct of different lengths from 1 to 18GHz of frequencies. In order to see the RCS performance, five different air intake cases are considered The RCS performance with increase in percentage surface area of rivet heads to RAS is reported in detail. At the last, an open-source aircraft CAD model is considered and the RCS performance of RAS air intake with and without rivets is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Capping agent control over the physicochemical and antibacterial properties of ZnO nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Life science research has largely benefited from the use of nanoparticles (NPs), yet fundamental issues such as colloidal stability and control over NP size and shape affect NP properties and functions in biomedical applications. Here we show that including capping agents directly into zinc oxide (ZnO) NP synthesis can lead to better control of these properties and their enhanced functionality. A systematic study of the influence capping agents has on the physicochemical and antibacterial properties of ZnO NP synthesized using the microwave (MW)-assisted polyol method is presented. Primary NP size (10-20 nm) was controlled by zinc precursor concentration, and NP shape was influenced by capping agent type. Capping agents enabled control over the surface charge and water interaction properties of ZnO for further investigations involving bacteria. The superior antibacterial effect was observed using positively charged, hydrophilic HMTA-capped ZnO, yet negatively charged hydrophobic OA-capped ZnO still exhibited an antibacterial effect. These observations suggest different underlying mechanisms, and we discuss these differences with particular reference to the specific surface area of ZnO, and how this is key to bacteria-nanoparticle interactions. Appropriate selection of capping agents is crucial for the synthesis of potent ZnO NPs intended for antibacterial applications, specifically for combating resistance.</description>

      <title>Universal whirling magnetic orders in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type quasicrystal approximants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and temperature-driven phase transition in quasi-one-dimensional zigzag chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band materials have garnered extensive attention due to their captivating properties associated with strong correlation effects. While flat bands have been discovered in several types of 2D materials, their existence in 1D systems remains elusive. Here, we propose a 1D frustrated lattice, specifically the 1D zigzag lattice, as a platform for hosting flat bands. This lattice can be experimentally realized by growing CuTe chains on Cu(111). The presence of flat bands was confirmed by tight-binding model analysis, first-principles calculations, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. In addition, we discovered a temperature-driven phase transition at approximately 250 K. Detailed analyses demonstrate that the system has a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, accompanied by spin-charge separation effects. Our work unveils new prospects for investigating strongly correlated electron behaviors and topological properties in the 1D limit.</description>

      <title>Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of Sn intercalation of the buffer layer on SiC was investigated with a frozen-in diffusion front using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy. The technique allows to laterally distinguish between intercalated regions and the pristine buffer layer. Comparing topography features with the surface potential on the mesoscopic scale confirms that surface steps act as transport barriers. The results show a distinct pin hole mechanism for the material flow from terrace to terrace of the vicinal substrate surface. Nucleation and the formation of tin intercalated phase on terraces happen at steps. This results in a mesoscopic growth against the macroscopic diffusion direction.</description>

Abstract: Single electrons confined to a free neon surface and manipulated through the circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED) architecture is a promising novel quantum computing platform. Understanding the exact physical nature of the electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states is important for realizing this platform's potential for quantum technologies. We investigate how resonator trench depth and substrate surface properties influence the formation of eNe charge states and their coupling to microwave resonators. Through experimental observation supported by modeling, we find that shallow-depth etching of the resonator features maximizes coupling strength. By comparing the trapping statistics and surface morphology of devices with altered trench roughness, our work reveals the role of fabrication-induced surface features in the formation of strongly coupled eNe states.</description>

      <title>Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si semiconductors for photovoltaic applications: Calculations based on density-functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive assessment of the electronic and optical properties, as well as photovoltaic (PV) performance parameters for Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si using density-functional theory and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) based methods. The band-gap for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si) is found to be in the range of 0.25-0.6 (0.57-0.96) eV when PBE, PBEsol and mBJ functionals are used. In the independent-particle approximation (IPA), the real and imaginary parts of dielectric function show maximum values of 50 (16.3) at 2.6 (1.0) eV and 61 (16.2) at $\sim$3.24 (3.4) eV, respectively. Within BSE, these respective values change to 59 (17) at 2.5 (0.86) eV and 65 (16.6) at 2.68 (3.1) eV. The excitonic effect is found to be crucial in understanding the experimental optical spectra of Mg$_{2}$Si. However, this effect is relatively weaker in Ca$_{2}$Si. Present study highlights the importance of different levels of theoretical approximations for obtaining the optical spectroscopy data of silicides with a high level of accuracy. Finally, we have evaluated PV efficiency by using spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) calculation. On the top of radiative recombination, we have also incorporated non-radiative carrier recombination at a defect trap state via Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) mechanism to evaluate the efficiency. Among the studied defects, the interstitial Mg (Si) is identified as the most stable in Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si) and this provides SRH lifetime of 2 $\mu s$ (11.3 $ms$). The estimated maximum SLME using BSE absorption spectrum is 1.3 (31.2)\%, which decreases to 1.2 (28.5)\% due to SRH recombination. The present study suggests that Ca$_{2}$Si (Mg$_{2}$Si) is a potential candidate for single-junction (bottom cell in multi-junction) thin-film PV devices.</description>

      <title>Catalogue of $C$-paired spin-momentum locking in antiferromagnetic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials (AFMs) have been gaining lots of attentions due to its great potential in spintronics devices and the recently discovered novel spin structure in the momentum space, i.e., $C$-paired spin-valley or spin-momentum locking (CSVL/CSML), where spins and valleys/momenta are locked to each other due to the crystal symmetry guaranteeing zero magnetization. Here, we systematically studied CSMLs and proposed a general theory and algorithm using little co-group and coset representatives, which reveals that 12 elementary kinds of CSMLs, determined by the geometric relation of spins and valleys and the essential symmetry guaranteeing zero magnetization, are sufficient to fully represent all possible CSMLs. By combining the proposed algorithm and high-throughput first-principles calculations, we predicted 38 magnetic point groups and identified 142 experimentally verified AFMs that can realize CSML. Besides predicting new materials, our theory can naturally reveal underlying mechanisms of CSMLs' responses to external fields. As an example, two qualitatively different types of piezomagnetism via occupation imbalance or spin tilting were predicted in RbV$_2$Te$_2$O. The algorithm and conclusions can be directly extended to the locking between valley/momentum and any other pseudo-vector degree of freedom, e.g., Berry curvature, as exemplified in RbV$_2$Te$_2$O and the new proposed piezo-Hall effect, where a strain can induce a non-zero anomalous Hall conductance. In addition, the proposed concept and methodology can be straightforwardly applied to other symmetry groups, such as spin group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the effects of Ge, Ga, and Al doping on the mechanical and electronic properties of cubic Cr$_3$Si using first-principles density functional theory (DFT). Doping increases lattice constants from 4.50 {\AA} for undoped Cr$_3$Si to 4.51-4.53 {\AA} (Ge), 4.52-4.54 {\AA} (Ga), and 4.51-4.54 {\AA} (Al) as doping concentrations increase from 12.5 $\%$ to 50 $\%$. Negative formation enthalpies across all configurations confirm thermodynamic stability, with values ranging from -0.35 eV/atom for undoped Cr$_3$Si to -0.33 eV/atom (Ge), -0.31 eV/atom (Al), and -0.25 eV/atom (Ga) at 50 $\%$ doping. Mechanical properties exhibit significant degradation with increased doping: bulk modulus decreases from 248.7 GPa for undoped Cr$_3$Si to 241 GPa (12.5 $\%$), 238 GPa (25 $\%$), 235 GPa (37.5 $\%$), and 231 GPa (50 $\%$) for Ge doping, with similar trends for Ga (230 GPa at 50 $\%$) and Al (232 GPa at 50 $\%$). Shear modulus and Young's modulus follow similar reductions, with shear modulus going from 158.9 GPa to 147 GPa (Ge), 145 GPa (Ga), and 147 GPa (Al) at 50 $\%$ doping. Elastic anisotropy increases notably with Al and Ga doping, while Ge maintains a relatively isotropic behavior. The wave velocities and Debye temperatures decrease for all dopants, with Debye temperature dropping from 720 K for undoped Cr$_3$Si to 700 K (Ge), 685 K (Ga), and 690 K (Al) at 50 $\%$ doping, reflecting a softer lattice and diminished thermal conductivity. While Al and Ga doping introduce higher anisotropy and reduce mechanical rigidity, Ge doping preserves isotropic mechanical behavior, making it the most suitable dopant for applications requiring balanced mechanical and thermal properties. These findings offer critical insights into tailoring Cr$_3$Si-based alloys for high-performance applications, highlighting trade-offs between stiffness, anisotropy, and thermal performance.</description>

Abstract: Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a ''new knob'' to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</description>

      <title>Post-Transition Metal Sn-Based Chalcogenide Perovskites: A Promising Lead-Free and Transition Metal Alternative for Stable, High-Performance Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their stability, non-toxicity, small bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, and defect tolerance. Although transition metal-based CPs, particularly those incorporating Zr and Hf, have been well-studied, they often exhibit higher bandgaps, lower charge carrier mobility, and reduced efficiency compared to lead-based halide perovskites (HPs). Tin (Sn), a post-transition metal with a similar oxidation state (+4) as Zr and Hf in ABX$_{3}$ structures but with different valence characteristics, remains underexplored in CPs. Given the influence of valence states on material properties, Sn-based CPs are of great interest. This study employs density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory (GW and BSE) to investigate a series of distorted Sn-based CPs (ASnX$_{3}$, A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se). Our results demonstrate that these perovskites are mechanically stable and exhibit lower direct G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ bandgaps (0.79-1.50 eV) compared to their Zr- and Hf-based counterparts. Analysis of carrier-phonon interactions reveals that the charge-separated polaronic state is less stable than the bound exciton state in these materials. Additionally, polaron-assisted charge carrier mobilities for electrons (21.33-416.02 cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) and holes (7.02-260.69 cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) are comparable to or higher than those in lead-based HPs and significantly exceed those of Zr- and Hf-based CPs, owing to reduced carrier-phonon coupling. The estimated spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (24.2%-31.2%)-confirmed through perovskite solar cell (PSC) simulations using SCAPS-1D software-indicates that these materials are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a lattice dynamics package which calculates elastic, thermodynamic and thermal transport properties of crystalline materials from data on their force and potential energy as a function of atomic positions. The data can come from density functional theory (DFT) calculations or classical molecular dynamics runs performed in a supercell. First, the model potential parameters, which are anharmonic force constants are extracted from the latter runs. Then, once the anharmonic model is defined, thermal conductivity and equilibrium properties at finite temperatures can be computed using lattice dynamics, Boltzmann transport theories, and a variational principle respectively. In addition, the software calculates the mechanical properties such as elastic tensor, Gruneisen parameters and the thermal expansion coefficient within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Phonons, elastic constants and thermodynamic properties results applied to the germanium crystal will be illustrated. Using the force constants as a force field, one may also perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to investigate the combined effects of anharmonicity and defect scattering beyond perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: Li-CO$_2$ batteries show promise as energy storage solutions, offering high theoretical energy density and CO$_2$ fixation. Their operation is based on the formation and decomposition of Li$_2$CO$_3$/C during discharge and charge cycles, respectively. We used a multiscale modeling framework that integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT), Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties. The considered Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic liquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth porous cathode with Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ as a catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical conductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the Kubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the cathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient, Li$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure. The FEA model, incorporating results from atomistic simulations, reproduced experimental voltage-capacity profiles at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed spatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$ concentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly, Li$_2$CO$_3$ can form large and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and local porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The capacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging from excessive discharge product deposition that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the performance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be improved by enhancing CO$_2$ transport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode architecture.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary interstitial segregation in substitutional binary alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) segregation is a powerful approach for optimizing the thermal and mechanical properties of metal alloys. In this study, we report significant GB interstitial segregation in a representative substitutional binary alloy system (Al-Ni) through atomistic simulations, challenging prevailing assumptions in the literature. Our findings show that Ni atoms preferentially segregate to interstitial sites within numerous kite-like GB structures in the Al bicrystals. An intriguing interplanar interstitial segregation pattern was also observed and analyzed. Additionally, interstitial segregation can induce unexpected GB transitions, such as kite transitions and nano-faceting, due to the existence of small interstitial sites. Building upon these observations, we developed a robust method to systematically identify the interstitial candidate sites for accommodating solutes at GBs. This approach combines site detection with structural filtering to produce distributions of interstitial sites that closely match atomistic simulation results. Applied to nanocrystalline alloys, this method enabled the calculation of interstitial segregation energies, significantly improving GB segregation predictions for the Al-Ni system. Furthermore, machine learning models using smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptors successfully predicted per-site interstitial segregation energy. This study highlights the critical role of GB interstitial segregation in advancing our understanding of solute behavior and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation alloys.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking induced surface magnetization in non-magnetic RuO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly identified phase of magnetism distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been considered a prototypical metallic altermagnet with a critical temperature higher than room temperature. Previous interpretations of the unusual magnetic properties of RuO$_2$ relied on the theoretical prediction that local moments on two Ru sublattices, which are connected by four-fold rotational symmetry, are quite significant (approximately 1 $\mu_B$), leading to long-range antiferromagnetic order. However, accumulated experimental data suggest that local moments on Ru in RuO$_2$ are vanishingly small, indicating that the bulk material is likely non-magnetic. This observation is consistent with the delocalized nature of the 4$d$ electrons of Ru and the strong screening effect in the metallic state. In this work, we show that despite the non-magnetic bulk, the RuO$_2$(110) surface exhibits spontaneous magnetization. We attribute this effect to the breaking of local symmetry, which results in electronic redistribution and magnetic moment enhancement. The emergence of surface magnetism gives rise to interesting spectroscopic phenomena, including spin-polarized surface states, spin-polarized scanning probe microscopy images, and potentially spin-dependent transport effects. These findings highlight the important role of surface magnetic structures in the otherwise non-magnetic bulk RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Misspecified Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of high-dimensional regression techniques from machine learning has significantly improved the quantitative accuracy of interatomic potentials. Atomic simulations can now plausibly target quantitative predictions in a variety of settings, which has brought renewed interest in robust means to quantify uncertainties on simulation results. In many practical settings, encompassing both classical and a large class of machine learning potentials, the dominant form of uncertainty is currently not due to lack of training data but to misspecification, namely the inability of any one choice of model parameters to exactly match all ab initio training data. However, Bayesian inference, the most common formal tool used to quantify uncertainty, is known to ignore misspecification and thus significantly underestimates parameter uncertainties. Here, we employ a recent misspecification-aware regression technique to quantify parameter uncertainties, which is then propagated to a broad range of phase and defect properties in tungsten via brute force resampling or implicit differentiation. The propagated misspecification uncertainties robustly envelope errors to direct \textit{ab initio} calculation of material properties outside of the training dataset, an essential requirement for any quantitative multi-scale modeling scheme. Finally, we demonstrate application to recent foundational machine learning interatomic potentials, accurately predicting and bounding errors in MACE-MPA-0 energy predictions across the diverse materials project database. Perspectives for the approach in multiscale simulation workflows are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dendrite suppression in fast-charging high-energy metal-ion batteries: a Bayesian optimization approach</title>

Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest possible energy density in batteries. However, challenges associated with electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth remain unsolved, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition and optimize its parameters for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The proposed approach provides a versatile tool for designing battery cells by optimizing an arbitrary objective function using an arbitrary set of parameters. This approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameters space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.</description>

Abstract: Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Magnetic Coupling in MN4-Graphene via Strain Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MN4-embedded graphene (MN4-G) layers, incorporating transition metal elements (M), represent a class of experimentally accessible two-dimensional materials with significant potential for stable nanoscale magnetization. In these systems, magnetic exchange interactions are primarily governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an anomalously prolonged decay of r to the power of (-n), where r is the M-M separation distance and n is between 0.5 and 2. This study investigates the impact of strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers using ab-initio density functional theory (DFT). A novel strain-engineering approach is developed by applying controlled tension or compression to the layers. Our findings reveal that strain significantly modulates the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling. Notably, the CoN4-G layer demonstrates a pronounced enhancement in RKKY coupling strength, oscillation amplitude, and reduced decay rate under strain. Conversely, the CuN4-G layer exhibits distinct behavior, maintaining decoupled spin chains and invariant electronic and magnetic properties despite applied strain. This work underscores the tunability of magnetic interactions in MN4-G layers via strain engineering, providing insights into the design of strain-controlled magnetic materials for next-generation spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a method to calculate the topology of the rate independent single crystal yield surface for materials with arbitrary slip systems and arbitrary slip strengths. We describe the general problem, as motivated by Schmid's law, and detail the calculation of hyperplanes in deviatoric stress space, $\mathbb{D}^5$, which describe the criteria for slip on individual slip systems. We focus on finding the intersection of five linearly independent hyperplanes which represent stresses necessary to satisfy the criteria for general plastic deformation. Finally, we describe a method for calculating the inner convex hull of these intersection points, which describe the vertices of the five dimensional polytope that represents the single crystal yield surface. Our method applies to arbitrary crystal structure, allowing for an arbitrary number and type of slip systems and families, considers plastic anisotropy via inter- and intra-family strength anisotropy, and further considers strength anisotropy between slip in the positive and negative direction. We discuss the calculation and possible applications, and share a computational implementation of the calculation of the single crystal yield surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals can emerge from Dirac semimetals when the time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetries are broken. Recently, it has been proposed based on the Floquet theory that Dirac semimetals can be converted into Weyl semimetals even by shining circularly polarized light (CPL). Here we have investigated the possibility of such a Dirac-Weyl conversion by measuring the CPL-induced anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in a massive 3D Dirac semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ in the paramagnetic phase using ultrafast mid-infrared pump-terahertz Faraday rotation probe spectroscopy. We find that the field-strength and driving frequency dependence of the observed AHC is well accounted for by CPL-induced nonzero Berry curvature associated with the splitting of the Dirac bands as predicted by the Floquet theory. The estimated splitting of the Dirac bands reaches about 60 % of the mass gap and the calculated CPL-induced AHC quantitatively reproduces the experimental observation, demonstrating a promising route toward the realization of Floquet-Weyl states from massive Dirac semimetals.</description>

Abstract: The behavior of strongly interacting electrons in bands with Berry curvature is a problem of wide interest. In this paper, we study this problem by numerically studying a fluxed Hubbard-type model on square lattice. Using this model, we demonstrate a metallic ferromagnet in electron bands equipped with Berry curvature can develop non-coplanar spin order in which spin polarization axes at different position span finite solid angles. We find spin chirality can emerge in this setting by doping or adding gauge flux on top of a collinear ferromagnet. This result supports the prediction of spin chirality occurring through an emergent spin orbital interaction. Meanwhile, our result shows that, on top a ferromagnetic background, the spin chirality emerges at a finite threshold value of orbital magnetization, resembling the predicted behavior in theory.</description>

      <title>Short-range order and hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>

Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</description>

      <title>Multi-block chemometric approaches to the unsupervised spectral characterization of geological samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an example for the potential use of multi-block chemometric methods to provide improved unsupervised characterization of compositionally complex materials through the integration of multi-modal spectrometric data sets, we analysed spectral data derived from five field instruments (one XRF, two NIR, and two FT-Raman), collected on 76 bedrock samples of diverse composition. These data were analysed by single- and multi- block latent variable models, based on principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). For the single-block approach, PCA and PLS models were generated; whilst hierarchical partial least squares (HPLS) regression was applied for the multi-block modelling. We also tested whether dimensionality reduction resulted in a more computationally efficient muti-block HPLS model with enhanced model interpretability and geological characterization power using the variable influence on projection (VIP) feature selection method.
  The results showed differences in the characterization power of the five spectrometer data sets for the bedrock samples based on their mineral composition and geological properties; moreover, some spectroscopic techniques under-performed for distinguishing samples by composition. The multi-block HPLS and its VIP-strengthened model yielded a more complete unsupervised geological aggrupation of the samples in a single parsimonious model. We conclude that multi-block HPLS models are effective at combining multi-modal spectrometric data to provide a more comprehensive characterization of compositionally complex samples, and VIP can reduce HPLS model complexity, while increasing its data interpretability. These approaches have been applied here to a geological data set, but are amenable to a broad range of applications across chemical and biomedical disciplines.</description>

      <title>Probing the limitations of multimodal language models for chemistry and materials research</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in scientific assistants that could support researchers across the full spectrum of scientific workflows, from literature review to experimental design and data analysis. A key capability for such systems is the ability to process and reason about scientific information in both visual and textual forms - from interpreting spectroscopic data to understanding laboratory setups. Here, we introduce MaCBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how vision-language models handle real-world chemistry and materials science tasks across three core aspects: data extraction, experimental understanding, and results interpretation. Through a systematic evaluation of leading models, we find that while these systems show promising capabilities in basic perception tasks - achieving near-perfect performance in equipment identification and standardized data extraction - they exhibit fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning, cross-modal information synthesis, and multi-step logical inference. Our insights have important implications beyond chemistry and materials science, suggesting that developing reliable multimodal AI scientific assistants may require advances in curating suitable training data and approaches to training those models.</description>

      <title>Larger grains in high-Tc superconductors synthesized by the solid-state reaction route</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state synthesis is widely used in exploratory research to study various structural modifications that affect the properties (critical temperature, critical current density, irreversibility field, etc.) of superconductors. The popularity of this method is due to its relative simplicity and availability of the necessary equipment. Combining solid-state synthesis and top-seeded melt growth allows us to increase the grain size in a Tm- and Nd-based 1-2-3 superconductor. Samples with a grain size up to 0.1 mm have been obtained. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and magnetization measurements have been used for investigating this superconducting material. The magnetization width {\Delta}M has increased significantly in the synthesized samples. However the temperature dependence of the intragrain critical current density and the pinning force scaling give evidences that the pinning mechanism in the obtained superconductor is essentially the same as in polycrystalline superconductors synthesized by standard solid-state technology. The increase in grain size in the synthesized samples is the main reason for the high values of {\Delta}M.</description>

      <title>Radiation sputtering of hydrocarbon ices at Europa-relevant temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surfaces of some icy moons, such as Jupiter's moon Europa, are heavily bombarded by energetic particles that can alter the surface materials and affect the composition of its exosphere. Detection of CO2 on Europa's surface indicate that Europa's interior may be transporting freshly exposed carbon-containing material to the surface. It is unknown whether this CO2 is a product of radiation of carbon-containing precursors or whether it is present in the initial deposits. Regardless, further radiolysis by high-energy electrons or ions can sputter CO2 (and organic fragments if present) into Europa's exosphere. In this study, we investigate the radiation sputtering of CO2 and organic fragments from hydrocarbon water ice mixtures at different Europa-relevant surface temperatures to identify how its sputtering products evolve over time. This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.</description>

      <title>Predicted versatile topological nodal magnons in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a recenly-estabilished band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent ${}^1E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$ (or ${}^2E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$). The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of quasicrystals and their approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.</description>
