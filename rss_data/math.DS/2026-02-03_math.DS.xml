      <title>$C^1$ Circle Covering with a Physical Measure on a Hyperbolic Repelling Fixed Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an example of a $C^1$ circle covering map topologically conjugate to the doubling map, such that it has a physical measure supported on a hyperbolic repelling fixed point. By relaxing the $C^1$ condition at a single point, we also construct an example where the basin of the physical measure has full measure. A key technical step is a realization lemma of independent interest, which gives a canonical way to construct a full branch map given its induced map.</description>

      <title>Global Attractivity of a Nonlocal Delayed Diffusive Dengue Model in a Spatially Homogeneous Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Xu and Zhao (2015), the global attractivity of positive constant steady state is established through the application of the fluctuation method, subject to the sufficient condition that the disease will stabilized at the unique spatially-homogeneous steady state if $\Re_0&gt;1$ exceeds a certain threshold. The focus of this study is to eliminate the need for a sufficient condition by employing a suitable Lyapunov functional and prove that the positive constant steady state is globally attractive when $\Re_0$ is exactly greater than unity, which significantly enhancing the findings outlined in Theorem 3.3 of Xu and Zhao (2015).</description>

      <title>On the degeneration of Kovalevskaya exponents of Laurent series solutions of quasi-homogeneous vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A structure of families of Laurent series solutions of a quasi-homogeneous vector field is studied, where a given vector field is assumed to have a commutable vector field. For an $m$ dimensional vector field, a family of Laurent series solutions is called principle if it includes $m$ arbitrary parameters, and called non-principle if the number is smaller than $m$. Starting from a principle Laurent series solutions, a systematic method to obtain a non-principle Laurent series solutions is given. In particular, from the Kovalevskaya exponents of the principle Laurent series solutions, which is one of the invariants of quasi-homogeneous vector fields, the Kovalevskaya exponents of the non-principle Laurent series solutions are obtained by using the commutable vector field.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of Remotely Almost Periodic solutions of differential equations with piecewise constant argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differential equations with piecewise constant argument (DEPCA) and establish the existence and uniqueness of remotely almost periodic (RAP) solutions for \[ x'(t)=A(t)x(t)+B(t)x([t])+f(t). \] Under an exponential dichotomy for the associated linear hybrid system \(x'(t)=A(t)x(t)+B(t)x([t])\) and suitable RAP/Lipschitz assumptions on the data, we derive sufficient conditions guaranteeing a unique RAP solution. We further consider perturbed DEPCA of the form \[ \begin{aligned} x'(t)&amp;=A(t)x(t)+B(t)x([t])+f(t)+\nu\,g_{\nu}\bigl(t,x(t),x([t])\bigr),\\ y'(t)&amp;=\tilde f\bigl(t,y(t),y([t])\bigr)+\nu\,g_{\nu}\bigl(t,y(t),y([t])\bigr), \end{aligned} \] and prove the existence (and, when appropriate, uniqueness) of RAP solutions for \(\nu\) in a suitable range, under mild uniform Lipschitz and smallness conditions on \(g_{\nu}\). As an application, we obtain RAP solutions for nonautonomous Lasota-Wazewska type models with piecewise constant argument, and show the existence of a unique positive RAP solution under biologically meaningful hypotheses.</description>

      <title>A Network-Based Framework to Identify Synergies and Trade offs among SDG Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires an understanding of the complex interlinkages that exist among their underlying indicators. While most existing research examines these interconnections at the goal level, policy interventions are typically designed and implemented at the indicator level, where synergies and trade-offs most directly emerge. This study addresses this gap by proposing a network-theoretic framework to assess indicator-level interactions in a systematic and data-driven manner. We introduce two complementary measures, the positive strength and negative strength of an indicator, which jointly capture the balance between synergistic and conflicting interactions within a national SDG indicator network. Based on these measures, indicators are classified as synergy- and trade-off-dominated according to their net systemic interaction structure. To move beyond classification, we further examine the structural drivers of synergy dominance using an explanatory regression framework, focusing on the roles of direct positive interactions and indirect network embeddedness. This analysis shows that indicators classified as synergy-dominated are typically characterized by a high concentration of direct synergies and additional support from indirect pathways through the network, allowing positive effects to extend beyond immediate neighbors. The framework is applied to two national case studies, India and Italy, to illustrate how the classification of indicators varies across development contexts. Overall, the proposed methodology provides a transparent and scalable tool for identifying the structural conditions under which indicator-level synergies emerge, thereby supporting a more nuanced understanding of how development actions can generate reinforcing effects across the SDG system.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Interpolation of a Vector Field on a Convex Polyhedral Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational method for reconstructing a vector field on a convex polytope $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of arbitrary dimension from discrete samples. We specifically address the scenario where the vector field is subject to a no-penetration (slip) boundary condition, requiring it to be tangent to the boundary $\partial \mathcal{P}$. Given a degree bound $k$, our algorithm computes a polynomial vector field of degree at most $k$ that fits the observed data in the least-squares sense while exactly satisfying the tangency constraints. Central to our approach is an explicit characterization of the module of polynomial vector fields tangent to $\partial \mathcal{P}$, derived using algebraic concepts from the theory of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic function-on-function nonlinear autoregressive model for emulation and reliability analysis of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing accurate and computationally efficient surrogate models (or emulators) for predicting dynamical system responses is critical in many engineering domains, yet remains challenging due to the strongly nonlinear and high-dimensional mapping from external excitations and system parameters to system responses. This work introduces a novel Function-on-Function Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (F2NARX), which reformulates the conventional NARX model from a function-on-function regression perspective, inspired by the recently proposed $\mathcal{F}$-NARX method. The proposed framework substantially improves predictive efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. By combining principal component analysis with Gaussian process regression, F2NARX further enables probabilistic predictions of dynamical responses via the unscented transform in an autoregressive manner. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies of varying complexity. Results show that F2NARX outperforms state-of-the-art NARX model by orders of magnitude in efficiency while achieving higher accuracy in general. Moreover, its probabilistic prediction capabilities facilitate active learning, enabling accurate estimation of first-passage failure probabilities of dynamical systems using only a small number of training time histories.</description>

      <title>Linear response for skew-product maps with contracting fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear response for families of skew-product dynamical systems with contracting fibres. Our approach is based on a sectional transfer operator acting on families of probability measures along the fibres. The operator allows to describe invariant measures of the skew-product in terms of sample measures over the base dynamics, regardless of invertibility or non-invertibility of the base map. Under general assumptions, we establish existence and uniqueness of invariant sample measures and prove their differentiability, with respect to system parameters, in suitable topologies. As an application we obtain linear response for Bernoulli convolutions, which are of prime importance in the study of number theoretic problems and fractals. Another application of our results yields linear response for physical measures of solenoidal attractors with intermittency, an example of a hyperbolic system which cannot be handled by traditional transfer operator techniques.</description>

      <title>On the Holomorphic and Random Dynamics for some examples of higher rank Free Groups generated by H\'enon type maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Holomorphic and Random Dynamics of some rank 2 free groups generated by two H\'enon type maps. For these simply constructed examples we prove that the Fatou set is non-empty and that the stationary measures are supported on a compact set. With some further care this allows us to construct examples having no stationary measures. These examples illustrate the types of phenomena that may arise when studying holomorphic group actions on non-compact manifolds.</description>

      <title>Multi-strain SIS dynamics with coinfection under host population structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coinfection phenomena are common in nature, yet there is a lack of analytical approaches for coinfection systems with a high number of circulating and interacting strains. In this paper, we investigated a coinfection SIS framework applied to N strains, co-circulating in a structured host population. Adopting a general formulation for fixed host classes, defined by arbitrary epidemiological traits such as class-specific transmission rates, susceptibilities, clearance rates, etc., our model can be easily applied in different frameworks: for example, when different host species share the same pathogen, in classes of vaccinated or non-vaccinated hosts, or even in classes of hosts defined by the number of contacts. Using the strain similarity assumption, we identify the fast and slow variables of the epidemiological dynamics on the host population, linking neutral and non-neutral strain dynamics, and deriving a global replicator equation. This global replicator equation allows to explicitly predict coexistence dynamics from mutual invasibility coefficients among strains. The derived global pairwise invasion fitness matrix contains explicit traces of the underlying host population structure, and of its entanglement with the strain interaction and trait landscape. Our work thus enables a more comprehensive study and efficient simulation of multi-strain dynamics in endemic ecosystems, paving the way to deeper understanding of global persistence and selection forces, jointly shaped by pathogen and host diversity.</description>

      <title>Null-Validated Topological Signatures of Financial Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial markets exhibit temporal organization that is not fully captured by volatility measures or linear correlation structure. We study a null validated topological approach for quantifying market complexity and apply it to Bitcoin daily log returns. The analysis uses the $L^1$ norm of persistence landscapes computed from sliding-window delay embeddings. This quantity shows strong co-movement with stochastic volatility during periods of market stress, but remains intermittently elevated during low volatility regimes, indicating dynamical structure beyond fluctuation scale. Rolling correlation analysis reveals that the dependence between geometry and volatility is not stationary. Surrogate based null models provide statistical validation of these observations. Rejection of shuffle surrogates rules out explanations based on marginal distributions alone, while departures from phase randomized surrogates indicate sensitivity to nonlinear and phase dependent temporal organization beyond linear correlations. These results demonstrate that persistence landscape norms provide complementary information about market dynamics across market conditions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Matrix-Spectral Framework for Stability and Interpretability in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified matrix-spectral framework for analyzing stability and interpretability in deep neural networks. Representing networks as data-dependent products of linear operators reveals spectral quantities governing sensitivity to input perturbations, label noise, and training dynamics.
  We introduce a Global Matrix Stability Index that aggregates spectral information from Jacobians, parameter gradients, Neural Tangent Kernel operators, and loss Hessians into a single stability scale controlling forward sensitivity, attribution robustness, and optimization conditioning. We further show that spectral entropy refines classical operator-norm bounds by capturing typical, rather than purely worst-case, sensitivity.
  These quantities yield computable diagnostics and stability-oriented regularization principles. Synthetic experiments and controlled studies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 confirm that modest spectral regularization substantially improves attribution stability even when global spectral summaries change little.
  The results establish a precise connection between spectral concentration and analytic stability, providing practical guidance for robustness-aware model design and training.</description>

      <title>Jarn\'ik-type theorem for self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K\subset\mathbb R^d$ be a compact subset equipped with a $\delta$-Ahlfors regular measure $\mu$. For any $\tau&gt;1/d$ and any ``inhomogeneous'' vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}\in\mathbb R^d$, let $W_d(\psi_\tau,\boldsymbol{\theta})$ denote the set of $(\psi_\tau,\boldsymbol{\theta})$-well approximable numbers, where $\psi_\tau(q)=q^{-\tau}$. Assuming a local estimate for the $\mu$-measure of the intersections of $K$ with the neighborhoods of ``rational'' vectors $(\mathbf p+\boldsymbol{\theta})/q$, we establish a sharp upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of $K\cap W_d(\psi_\tau,\boldsymbol{\theta})$, together with some nontrivial lower bounds when $\tau$ is below a certain threshold. One of the lower bounds becomes sharp in the one-dimensional homogeneous case ($d=1$, $\theta=0$) for a class of sufficiently thick self-similar sets $K$, and moreover $K\cap W_1(\psi_\tau,0)$ has full $(\delta+\frac{2}{1+\tau}-1)$-Hausdorff measure. These results have several applications:
  (1) the set of homogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within strongly irreducible self-similar sets in $\mathbb R^d$, extending a recent result of Chen [arXiv:2510.17096];
  (2) the set of inhomogeneous very well approximable numbers has full Hausdorff dimension within sufficiently thick missing digits sets in $\mathbb R$, affirmatively answering a question posed by Yu [arXiv:2101.05910].
  Our applications build on the seminal works of Yu [arXiv:2101.05910] and B\'enard, He and Zhang [arXiv:2508.09076].</description>

      <title>Non-stability of Liouville measures under convex combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every non-hyper-FC-central countable amenable group and every $k\geq 2$, we provide a sequence of symmetric, fully supported probability measures such that their convex combination is non-Liouville (that is it admits a non-constant bounded harmonic function, equivalently, the Poisson boundary is non-trivial) if and only if at least $k$ of them appear in the convex combination. Particularly, our result implies that the set of Liouville measures is not closed under convex combination, which answers a question of Kaimanovich. We also provide a similar result under the additional assumption of finite entropy for those non-hyper-FC-central countable groups with the property that every symmetric, finitely supported probability measure is Liouville. These groups are the only known non-trivial examples of countable groups that admit Liouville measures with finite entropy. Examples include the lamplighter group over $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and the infinite symmetric group of finite permutations on $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Instability of solutions in a degenerate reaction diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral stability of travelling and stationary front and pulse solutions in a class of degenerate reaction-diffusion systems. We characterise the essential spectrum of the linearised operator in full generality and identify conditions under which it lies entirely in the left-half plane. For a number of special cases we obtain analytical results, including explicit Evans functions, and complete spectral descriptions for certain stationary waves. In regimes where analytical methods are not available, we compute the point spectrum numerically using a Riccati-Evans function approach. Our results show that stable travelling fronts can occur, while travelling pulses are typically unstable.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite simplicial complex, let $g\colon K\to K$ be a simplicial map and let $f$ be a discrete Morse-Bott function on $K$ satisfying $f(g(\sigma))\leq f(\sigma)$ for all simplices $\sigma$ in $K$. We establish a set of inequalities (generalizing the Morse-Bott inequalities which we recover as a particular case when $g$ is the identity) relating the dynamics of $g$ and $f$.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural chemical reaction networks trained to switch dynamical behaviours through learned bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both natural and synthetic chemical systems not only exhibit a range of non-trivial dynamics, but also transition between qualitatively different dynamical behaviours as environmental parameters change. Such transitions are called bifurcations. Here, we show that recurrent neural chemical reaction networks (RNCRNs), a class of chemical reaction networks based on recurrent artificial neural networks that can be trained to reproduce a given dynamical behaviour, can also be trained to exhibit bifurcations. First, we show that RNCRNs can inherit some bifurcations defined by smooth ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Second, we demonstrate that the RNCRN can be trained to infer bifurcations that allow it to approximate different target behaviours within different regions of parameter space, without explicitly providing the bifurcation itself in the training. These behaviours can be specified using target ODEs that are discontinuous with respect to the parameters, or even simply by specifying certain desired dynamical features in certain regions of the parameter space. To achieve the latter, we introduce an ODE-free algorithm for training the RNCRN to display designer oscillations, such as a heart-shaped limit cycle or two coexisting limit cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for the base two expansion \[ x=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}2^{-(d_{1}(x)+d_{2}(x)+\dots+d_{i}(x))}\] with $x\in(0,1]$ and $d_{i}(x)\in\mathbb{N}$ the set $A=\{x|\lim_{i\to\infty}d_{i}(x)=\infty\}$ has Hausdorff dimension zero, this is opposed to a result on the continued fraction expansion, here $A$ has Hausdorff dimension $1/2$, see \cite{[GO]}. Furthermore we construct subsets of $B=\{x|\limsup_{i\to\infty}d_{i}(x)=\infty\}$ which have Hausdorff dimension one and find a dimension spectrum in set $B$.</description>

Abstract: For certain pairs of unimodal maps on the interval with periodic critical orbits, it is known that one can combine them to create another map whose entropy is close to one while the poles of Artin-Mazur $\zeta$ function outside the unit circles can be made close to the other. We provided a formulation and proof of this result in symbolic dynamics setting, which allow us to generalize this fact to certain families of maps on finite trees.</description>

Abstract: Answering a question asked by Hsia and Tucker in their paper on the finiteness of greatest common divisors of iterates of polynomials, we prove that if $f, g \in \mathbb{C}(X)$ are compositionally independent rational functions and $c \in \mathbb{C}(X)$, then there are at most finitely many $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ with the property that there is an $n$ such that $f^n(\lambda) = g^n(\lambda) = c(\lambda)$, except for a few families of $f, g \in Aut(\mathbb{P}^1_\mathbb{C})$ which gives counterexamples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit an example of discontinuity point for the Lyapunov exponents as a function of the cocycle in the $\alpha$-H\"older topology. The linear cocycle taking values in $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ is locally constant and defined over a Bernoulli shift. Our example extends Bocker-Viana's and Butler's results. In particular, it gives a partial answer to a question raised by Clark Butler. Finally, we give an example of discontinuity in the setting of $SL(m,\mathbb{R})$-valued cocycles, which is constructed from $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$-valued cocycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X = G/\Gamma$ be a quotient of a real Lie group by a non-uniform lattice. Consider a one-parameter subgroup $F$ of $G$ that is $\operatorname{Ad}$-diagonalizable over $\mathbb{C}$ and whose action on $(X,m_X)$ is mixing. In this dynamical system we study the set of points $x \in X$ with a precompact orbit, written as $E(F,\infty)$, which is known to be a dense subset of $X$ of full Hausdorff dimension. We prove that $E(F,\infty)$ is indecomposable in the following sense: given any $y \in E(F,\infty)$, the set of $x \in E(F,\infty)$ for which $y \in \overline{F_+x}$, where $F_+$ denotes the positive ray in $F$, is uncountable and dense in $E(F,\infty)$. When the dimension of the neutral subgroup of $G$ with respect to $F$ is $1$ we demonstrate, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, the existence of many points $x \in X$ whose orbit closure $\overline{F_+x} \subset X$ is compact and has Hausdorff dimension at least $\dim X - \varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>A billiard table close to an ellipse is deformationally spectrally rigid among dihedrally symmetric domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a a strongly convex planar domain (Birkhoff table) with dihedral symmetry, which is sufficiently close in a finitely smooth topology to an ellipse, is deformationally spectrally rigid within the class of domains preserving this symmetry. More precisely, any smooth one-parameter family of such domains that preserves the length spectrum (i.e., the set of lengths of periodic billiard orbits) must consist only of rigid motions of the initial domain. The proof combines two types of dynamical data: the asymptotic behavior of certain symmetric periodic orbits, as previously used in the rigidity of nearly circular domains, and new spectral information derived from KAM invariant curves, obtained from Mather's beta function and its derivatives (in the Whitney sense) at some suitable rotation numbers.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of highly inclined near halo orbits using Moser regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation structure of highly inclined near halo orbits with close approaches to the light primary, in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). Using a Hamiltonian formulation together with Moser regularization, we develop a numerical framework for the continuation of periodic orbits and the computation of their Floquet multipliers which remains effective near collision. We describe vertical collision orbits and families emerging from its pitchfork, period-doubling, and period-tripling bifurcations in the limiting Hill's problem, including the halo and butterfly families. We continue these into the CR3BP using a perturbative framework via a symplectic scaling, and construct bifurcation graphs for representative systems (Saturn-Enceladus, Earth-Moon, Copenhagen) to identify common dynamical features. Conley-Zehnder indices are computed to classify the resulting families. Together, these results provide a coherent global picture of polar orbit architecture near the light primary, offering groundwork for future mission design, such as Enceladus plume sampling missions.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this note is to explore, from a geometric and probabilistic point of view, the dynamics of cone structures adapted to open book decompositions. This is inspired by the picture which arises in the study of the circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP). This yields geometric obstructions to reaching a point from another point in the phase space of the CR3BP.</description>

      <title>Log Baum--Bott Residues for foliations by curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Baum--Bott type residual formula for one-dimensional holomorphic foliations, and logarithmic along free divisors. More precisely, this provides a Baum--Bott theorem for a foliated triple $(X, \mathcal{F}, D)$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a foliation by curves and $D$ is a free divisor on a complex manifold $X$. From the local point of view, we show that the log Baum--Bott residues are a generalization of the Aleksandrov logarithmic index for vector fields with isolated singularities on hypersurfaces. We also show how these new indices are related to Poincar\'e's Problem for foliations by curves. In the case of foliated surfaces, we show that the differences between the logarithmic residues and Baum--Bott indices along invariant curves can be expressed in terms of the GSV and Camacho--Sad indices. We also obtain a Baum--Bott type formula for singular varieties via log resolutions. Finally, we prove a weak global version of the Zariski--Lipman conjecture for compact algebraic surfaces, in the form of a foliated smoothness criterion, suggesting the appearance of saddle-nodes in the singularity reduction on singular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Randomized Geodesic Flow on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Gromov's geodesic flow problem on hyperbolic groups $G$, we develop in this paper an analog using random walks. This leads to a notion of a harmonic analog $\Theta$ of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\partial^2 G$. We provide three different but related constructions of $\Theta$: 1) by moving the base-point along a quasigeodesic ray 2) by moving the base-point along random walk trajectories 3) directly as a push-forward under the boundary map to $\partial^2 G$ of a measure inherited from studying all bi-infinite random walk trajectories (with no restriction on base-point) on $G^\mathbb{Z}$. Of these, the third construction is the most involved and needs new techniques. It relies on developing a framework where we can treat bi-infinite random walk trajectories as analogs of bi-infinite geodesics on complete simply connected negatively curved manifolds. Geodesic flow on a hyperbolic group is typically not well-defined due to non-uniqueness of geodesics. We circumvent this problem in the random walk setup by considering \emph{all} trajectories. We thus get a well-defined discrete flow that we call the \emph{randomized geodesic flow}, given by the $\mathbb{Z}-$shift on bi-infinite random walk trajectories. The $\mathbb{Z}-$shift is the random analog of the time one map of the geodesic flow. As an analog of ergodicity of the geodesic flow on a closed negatively curved manifold, we establish ergodicity of the $G$-action on $(\partial^2G, \Theta)$. As a consequence of our construction, we prove that the randomized geodesic flow is exponentially mixing of all orders and establish a functional CLT.</description>

      <title>True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</description>

      <title>Hyper-u-amenablity and Hyperfiniteness of Treeable Equivalence Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of u-amenability and hyper-u-amenability for countable Borel equivalence relations, strong forms of amenability that are implied by hyperfiniteness. We show that treeable, hyper-u-amenable countable Borel equivalence relations are hyperfinite. One of the corollaries that we get is that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is measure-hyperfinite and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a free continuous action of a virtually free group on a $\sigma$-compact Polish space, then it is hyperfinite. We also obtain that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is treeable and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a Borel action of an amenable group on a standard Borel space, or if it is treeable, amenable and Borel bounded, then it is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with library optimization mechanism: Recursive long-term prediction perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized. The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term (RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The dynamical model obtained by SINDy-LOM has good interpretability and usability, as this approach yields a parsimonious closed-form model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Variational Stability in Deep Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which measures how infinitesimal perturbations propagate through representations, parameters, and update mechanisms along the learning trajectory.
  Our main result, the Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem, shows that uniform boundedness of these sensitivities is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy dissipating along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, this yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractive behavior. Classical spectral stability of feedforward networks, CFL-type conditions for residual architectures, and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods follow as direct consequences.
  The framework extends to non-smooth systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals.
  The resulting theory provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how design and training choices jointly control robustness and sensitivity to perturbations.</description>
