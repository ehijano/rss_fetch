      <title>Features of the EAR2 neutron beam following the spallation target upgrade at the n_TOF facility at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The n_TOF facility at CERN has undergone a major upgrade after the installation of a new spallation target, designed to improve the features of both neutron beamlines at the experimental areas 1 and 2 (EAR1 and EAR2) and the commissioning of a new experimental area (NEAR). Due to improved coupling of the spallation target with the EAR2 beamline, the upgrade resulted in a significantly increased neutron flux and improved neutron energy resolution. This paper presents the results of the commissioning phase that followed to characterise the EAR2 neutron beamline and validate the FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations of the facility. The main features of the neutron beam, namely the neutron flux, spatial profile and energy resolution, are evaluated and compared to the previous target. The neutron flux presents a general increase of 20% below 1 eV, 40% between 1 eV and 100 keV and 50% between 100 keV and 10 MeV. The measured width of the beam profile was 3 cm (FWHM) at the reference position for neutron capture measurements. The energy resolution with the new spallation target shows a significant improvement compared to the previous one. Moreover, FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations present a good agreement with the measured neutron flux and profile within uncertainties, and a remarkable reproduction of the energy resolution.</description>

      <title>Full realization of the RIBLL2 separator at the HIRFL-CSR facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new experimental platform was constructed at the Second Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou (RIBLL2) of HIRFL-CSR accelerator facility at Lanzhou, China. Its performance, along with several newly developed detectors, was tested in two radioactive ion beam experiments utilizing a 400 MeV/u 40Ar beam and a 350 MeV/u 78Kr beam, respectively. The first results from these two experiments demonstrate a good particle identification capability of the setup, thereby affirming the full realization of the RIBLL2 separator.</description>

      <title>Design and Monte Carlo Simulation of a Phase Grating Moir\'e Neutron Interferometer to Measure the Gravitational Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational constant (G) is the least precisely known fundamental constant of nature, with persistent and significant discrepancies between measurement methods. New techniques for measuring G with systematic effects different from commonly applied pendulum methods are required. Neutrons are convenient probes of gravitational forces as they are both massive and electrically neutral, properties that allowed a single-crystal neutron interferometer (NI) to achieve the first experimental demonstration of gravitationally induced quantum interference. Despite this, the limitation of single-crystal NIs to monoenergetic beams significantly reduces neutron flux, making precision gravitational measurements unfeasible. A new NI design called the phase-grating moir\'{e} interferometer (PGMI) has been shown to increase neutron flux by orders of magnitude while allowing grating separation that maintains similar interferometer area to previous NI devices. Here, we propose and describe an experiment to measure G using the PGMI to a precision comparable to measurements from the CODATA 2022 evaluation. A Monte Carlo model for incorporating nonlinear potentials into a PGMI is introduced. This model is used to evaluate sources of systematic uncertainty and quantify the uncertainty in G arising from these effects. The effect of lunar gravitation on a torsion pendulum experiment from CODATA 2022 is calculated, and the need for possible correction factors is demonstrated. This work demonstrates that a neutron PGMI can be used to measure G to $150$ parts-per-million in the near term with the potential to achieve greater precision in future experimental designs.</description>

      <title>HGPflow: Extending Hypergraph Particle Flow to Collider Event Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high energy physics, the ability to reconstruct particles based on their detector signatures is essential for downstream data analyses. A particle reconstruction algorithm based on learning hypergraphs (HGPflow) has previously been explored in the context of single jets. In this paper, we expand the scope to full proton-proton and electron-positron collision events and study reconstruction quality using metrics at the particle, jet, and event levels. Instead of passing entire events through HGPflow, we train it on smaller partitions for scalability and to avoid potential bias from long-range correlations related to the physics process. We demonstrate that this approach is feasible and that on most metrics, HGPflow outperforms both traditional particle flow algorithms and a machine learning-based benchmark model.</description>

      <title>MuonSLab: A plastic scintillator based detector for muon measurement in the deep ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric muons are important probes for studying primary cosmic rays and extensive air showers. Additionally, they constitute a significant background for many underground and deep-sea neutrino experiments, such as TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT). Understanding the muon flux at various depths in the deep sea is essential for validating TRIDENT simulations and guiding the development of optimized trigger strategies. This paper introduces a novel device based on plastic scintillalors and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) named MuonSLab, which is designed to measure muon flux in the deep sea and has the potential to be extended to other atmospheric muon property measurements. We discuss the design and instrumentation of MuonSLab and present results from several muon flux measurements, demonstrating its sensitivity to muon detection and its stability during operations across multiple locations.</description>
