      <title>Prescription of the Robin spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01451v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact connected smooth manifold with smooth boundary, and let $\rho$ be a positive continuous function on the boundary which is served as the Robin parameter. In this paper, we study three problems concerning the prescription of finite Robin spectrum: (1) Prescribing finitely many Robin eigenvalues and the volume. (2) Within a fixed conformal class, prescribing the multiplicities of finitely many Robin eigenvalues. (3) Within a fixed conformal class, prescribing finitely many distinct Robin eigenvalues and the volume. A key step in our method is to solve the corresponding problems for the Dirichlet spectrum. As a consequence, we also obtain analogous results for the Dirichlet case.</description>

      <title>Connecting topological strings and spectral theory via non-autonomous Toda equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Topological String/Spectral theory duality on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds obtained from the resolution of the cone over the $Y^{N,0}$ singularity. Assuming Kyiv formula, we demonstrate this duality in a special regime thanks to an underlying connection between spectral determinants of quantum mirror curves and the non-autonomous (q)-Toda system. We further exploit this link to connect small and large time expansions in Toda equations. In particular we provide an explicit expression for their tau functions at large time in terms of a strong coupling version of irregular $W_N$ conformal blocks at $c=N-1$. These are related to a special class of multi-cut matrix models which describe the strong coupling regime of four dimensional, $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>A Lee-Huang-Yang type expansion for the thermodynamic energy density of a dilute mixture of Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dilute gas in 3D composed of two species of bosons interacting through positive inter-species and intra-species pairwise potentials. We prove a second order expansion for the energy density in the thermodynamic limit. For the case of compactly supported, integrable potentials, we derive the correct second order of the expansion. If we make the further assumption of having soft potentials, we also derive the correct coefficient of the second order and the resulting formula is coherent with the physics literature. If we let the density and scattering length of one of the species go to zero, we obtain the Lee-Huang-Yang formula for one species of bosons. The paper also contains a proof of BEC for a mixture of bosons in a box with length scale larger than the Gross-Pitaevskii one.</description>

      <title>Towards an Explainable Comparison and Alignment of Feature Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature, comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.
