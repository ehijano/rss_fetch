      <title>Dissipation induced transition between extension and localization in the three-dimensional Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the probable extension-localization transition in open quantum systems with disorder. The disorder can induce localization in isolated quantum systems and it is generally recognized that localization is fragile under the action of dissipations from the external environment due to its interfering nature. Recent work [Y. Liu, et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 216301 (2024)] found that a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system can be driven into the localization phase by a tailored local dissipation where a dissipation-induced extended-localized transition is proposed. Based on this, we consider a more realistic system and show that a dissipation-induced transition between extension and localization appears in the three-dimensional (3D) Anderson model. By tuning local dissipative operators acting on nearest neighboring sites, we find that the system can relax to localized states dominated steady state instead of the choice of initial conditions and dissipation strengths. Moreover, we can also realize an extended states predominated steady state from a localized initial state by using a kind of dissipation operators acting on next nearest neighboring sites. Our results enrich the applicability of dissipation-induced localization and identify the transition between extended and localized phases in 3D disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamic length increases monotonically in pinned and unpinned glass forming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Random First Order Transition Theory (RFOT) predicts that transport proceeds by cooperative movement of particles in domains whose sizes increase as a liquid is compressed above a characteristic volume fraction, $\phi_d$. The rounded dynamical transition around $\phi_d$, which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ($&gt; \phi_d$). Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around $\phi_d$. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wave length limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multi particle structure factor, $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamic length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in glass forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems. This prediction, which also holds in the presence of added monovalent salt, may be validated using imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quasi-cycles as a simple explanation for the time evolution of the Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine ecological reserve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dataset collected at the Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine (CR-OPM) reserve on the North Island of New Zealand is rather unique. It describes the cyclic time evolution of a rocky intertidal community, with the relative abundances of the various coastal species that have been meticulously monitored for more than 20 years. Past theoretical studies, anchored on a deterministic description, required invoking ad hoc mechanisms to reproduce the observed dynamical paths. Following a maximum likelihood approach to interpolate individual stochastic trajectories, we here propose quasi-cycles as an alternative and simpler mechanism to explain the oscillations observed in the population numbers of the ecosystem. From a general standpoint, we also show that it is possible to return conclusive evidence on the existence of stochastic quasi-cycles, without resorting to global fitting strategies which necessitate handling a large collection of independent replicas of the dynamics, a possibility that is often precluded in real life applications.</description>

      <title>Learning thermodynamics and topological order of the 2D XY model with generative real-valued restricted Boltzmann machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting the topological Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition in the prototypical 2D XY model using unsupervised machine learning methods has long been a challenging problem due to the lack of suitable order parameters. To address this issue, we begin with a conventional real-valued RBM (RBM-xy), which uses exponential conditional probabilities to generate visible units. We then develop a novel real-valued RBM (RBM-CosSin) featuring nonlinear cos/sin activation, whose visible units follow the von Mises distribution. Our findings reveal that RBM-CosSin effectively learns the underlying Boltzmann distribution of 2D XY systems and generate authentic XY configurations that accurately capture both thermodynamics and topological order (vortex). Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to extract phase transition information, including the KT transition, from the weight matrices without relying on prior physics knowledge.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for Anderson localization on high-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the $\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its $d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the $\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>
