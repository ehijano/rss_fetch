      <title>Sounds waves and fluctuations in one-dimensional supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the low-energy excitations of a dilute supersolid state of matter with a one-dimensional crystal structure. A hydrodynamic description is developed based on a Lagrangian, incorporating generalized elastic parameters derived from ground state calculations. The predictions of the hydrodynamic theory are validated against solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, by comparing the speeds of sound, density fluctuations, and phase fluctuations of the two gapless bands. Our results are presented for two distinct supersolid models: a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate in an infinite tube and a dilute Bose gas of atoms with soft-core interactions. Characteristic energy scales are identified, highlighting that these two models approximately realize the bulk incompressible and rigid lattice supersolid limits.</description>

      <title>Exact evaluation of large-charge correlation functions in non-relativistic conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-charge master field which generates all n-point correlation functions with an insertion of large charge Q in non-relativistic conformal field theory is obtained. This field is used to compute Schr\"odinger-invariant n-point correlation functions of large-charge operators via a direct evaluation of the path integral. Conformal dimensions are found to agree with calculations based on the state-operator correspondence. The master field solution exhibits an emergent harmonic trap whose frequency is a function of the Euclidean time. The large-charge effective action with operator insertions describes a droplet of superfluid matter whose spatial size scales with the time separation of sources. The solution is used to compute Schr\"odinger symmetry breaking corrections in the large-charge effective field theory (EFT) due to a finite scattering length in the fundamental theory of fermions near unitarity. The scaling of these effects in the large-charge power counting scheme is established, and the size of the effects is quantified using input from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the near-unitary gas, as well as from the large-N expansion at large charge.</description>

      <title>A generic reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in metallic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi sea can host exotic quantum topology, which determines the conductance quantization in metals and is characterized by the Euler characteristic $\chi_F$. Here, we propose a generic reduction theory for the Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be identified by the feature of reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. We also reveal a striking connection between the Fermi sea topology and the gapped band topology, in which $\chi_F$ exactly equals to the topological invariant of the gapped topological phases by using an ingenious mapping. This nontrivial result provides a potential method to probe $\chi_F$ through $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological superconductors and further paves the way for studying the Fermi sea topology via the gapped topological systems. Our work promotes a deep understanding and simple detection for $\chi_F$, which shall facilitate the discovery of other novel physical effects caused by the Fermi sea topology in the future.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Oscillator Circuit with Quantum Current Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the properties of atomic current in a superfluid oscillating circuit consisting of a mesoscopic channel that connects two reservoirs of a Bose-Einstein condensate. We investigate the presence of a critical current in the channel and examine how the amplitude of the oscillations in the number imbalance between the two reservoirs varies with system parameters. In addition to highlighting that the dissipative resistance stems from the formation of vortex pairs, we also illustrate the role of these vortex pairs as a quantum current regulator. The dissipation strength is discrete based on the number imbalance, which corresponds to the emergence of vortex pairs in the system. Our findings indicate that the circuit demonstrates characteristics of both voltage-limiting and current-limiting mechanisms. To model the damping behavior of the atomic superfluid circuit, we develop an equivalent LC oscillator circuit with a quantum current regulator.</description>

      <title>Resonance triplet dynamics in the quenched unitary Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quenched unitary Bose gas is a paradigmatic example of a strongly interacting out-of-equilibrium quantum system, whose dynamics become difficult to describe theoretically due to the growth of non-Gaussian quantum correlations. We develop a conserving many-body theory capable of capturing these effects, allowing us to model the post-quench dynamics in the previously inaccessible time regime where the gas departs from the universal prethermal stage. Our results show that this departure is driven by the growth of strong lossless three-body correlations, rather than atomic losses, thus framing the heating of the gas in this regime as a fully coherent phenomenon. We uncover the specific few-body scattering processes that affect this heating, and show that the expected connection between the two-body and three-body contacts and the tail of the momentum distribution is obscured following the prethermal stage, explaining the absence of this connection in experiments. Our general framework, which reframes the dynamics of unitary quantum systems in terms of explicit connections to microscopic physics, can be broadly applied to any quantum system containing strong few-body correlations.</description>

      <title>Density engineering via inter-condensate dipole-dipole interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of inter-condensate dipole-dipole interactions in a setup consisting of physically disconnected single-species dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. In particular, making use of the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipole-dipole interactions, we show that the density of a {\em target} dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate can be axially confined and engineered using a trapped {\em control} dipolar condensate. Increasing the number of control condensates leads to exotic ground state structures, including periodic patterns. The latter consists of single and double-peaked structures with coherence between the peaks controlled via the separation between the control condensates, thereby accessing both supersolid-like structures and incoherent arrays of density peaks.</description>

      <title>Emergent inflation of the Efimov spectrum under three-body spin-exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve the unexpected and long-standing disagreement between experiment and theory in the Efimovian three-body spectrum of Li-7, commonly referred to as the lithium few-body puzzle. Our results show that the discrepancy arises out of the presence of strong non-universal three-body spin-exchange interactions, which enact an effective inflation of the universal Efimov spectrum. This conclusion is obtained from a thorough numerical solution of the quantum mechanical three-body problem, including precise interatomic interactions and all spin degrees of freedom for three alkali-metal atoms. Our results show excellent agreement with the experimental data regarding both the Efimov spectrum and the absolute rate constants of three-body recombination, and in addition reveal a general product propensity for such triatomic reactions in the Paschen-Back regime, stemming from Wigner's spin conservation rule.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hysteresis Across a Dissipative Multi-Mode Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative phase transitions are characteristic features in open quantum systems. Key signatures are the dynamical switching between different states in the vicinity of the phase transition and the appearance of hysteresis. Here, we experimentally study dynamic sweeps across a first order dissipative phase transition in a multi-mode driven-dissipative system. In contrast to previous studies, we perform sweeps of the dissipation strength instead of the driving strength. We extract exponents for the scaling of the hysteresis area in dependence of the sweep time and study the $g^{(2)}(0)$ correlations, which show non-trivial behavior. By changing the temperature of the system we investigate the importance of coherently pumping the system. We compare our results to numerical calculations done for a single mode variant of the system, and find surprisingly good agreement. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the differences between a scan of the dissipation strength and a scan of the driving strength.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models, particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions. However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{&gt;}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>Phase Crossover induced by Dynamical Many Body Localization in Periodically Driven Long-Range Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical many-body freezing occurs in periodic transverse field-driven integrable quantum spin systems. Under freezing conditions, quantum dynamics causes practically infinite hysteresis in the drive response, maintaining its starting value. We find similar resonant freezing in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model. In the LMG, the freezing conditions in the driving field suppresses the heating postulated by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) by inducing dynamical many-body localization, or DMBL. This is in contrast to Many Body Localization (MBL), which requires disorder to suppress ETH. DMBL has been validated by the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the quasistationary Floquet modes. Similarly to the TFIM, the LMG exhibits high-frequency localization only at freezing points. IPR localization in the LMG deteriorates with an inverse system size law at lower frequencies, which indicates heating to infinite temperature. Furthermore, adiabatically increasing frequency and amplitude from low values raises the Floquet state IPR in the LMG from nearly zero to unity, indicating a phase crossover. This occurrence enables a future technique to construct an MBL engine in clean systems that can be cycled by adjusting drive parameters only.</description>

      <title>Emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance in two-band superconductors with an incipient quasi-flat band: Enhanced critical temperature evading particle-hole fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In superconductivity, a surge of interests in enhancing $T_{\rm c}$ is ever mounting, where a recent focus is toward multi-band superconductivity. In $T_{\rm c}$ enhancements specific to two-band cases, especially around the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover considered here, we have to be careful about how quantum fluctuations affect the many-body states, i.e., particle-hole fluctuations suppressing the pairing for attractive interactions. Here we explore how to circumvent the suppression by examining multichannel pairing interactions in two-band systems. With the Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov (GMB) formalism for particle-hole fluctuations in a continuous space, we look into the case of a deep dispersive band accompanied by an incipient heavy-mass (i.e., quasi-flat) band. We find that, while the GMB corrections usually suppress $T_{\rm c}$ significantly, this in fact competes with the enhanced pairing arising from the heavy band, with the trade-off leading to a peaked structure in $T_{\rm c}$ against the band-mass ratio when the heavy band is incipient. The system then plunges into a strong-coupling regime with the GMB screening vastly suppressed. This occurs prominently when the chemical potential approaches the bound state lurking just below the heavy band, which can be viewed as a Fano-Feshbach resonance, with its width governed by the pair-exchange interaction. The diagrammatic structure comprising particle-particle and particle-hole channels is heavily entangled, so that the emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance dominates all the channels, suggesting a universal feature in multiband superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in $2+1$D Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars has been established across different quantum many-body systems, including spin-1/2 Quantum Link Models. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, concretely for Truncated Link Models, where the electric field is truncated rather than replaced by spins. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ Quantum Link Models. The proposed analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods.</description>
