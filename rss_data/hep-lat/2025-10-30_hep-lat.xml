      <title>A Euclidean Monte-Carlo-informed route to ground-state preparation for quantum simulation of scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators hold great promise for studying real-time (Minkowski) dynamics of quantum field theories. Nonetheless, preparing non-trivial initial states remains a major obstacle. Euclidean-time Monte-Carlo methods yield ground-state spectra and static correlation functions that can, in principle, guide state preparation. In this work, we exploit this classical information to bridge Euclidean and Minkowski descriptions for a (1+1)-dimensional interacting scalar field theory. We propose variational ansatz families which achieve comparable ground-state energies, yet exhibit distinct correlations and local non-Gaussianity. By optimizing selected wavefunction moments with Monte-Carlo data, we obtain ansatzes that can be efficiently translated into quantum circuits. Our algorithmic cost analysis shows these circuits' gate complexity scales polynomially in system size. Our work paves the way for systematically leveraging classically-computed information to prepare initial states in quantum field theories of interest in nature.</description>

      <title>Isotensor $\pi\pi \pi$ scattering with a $\rho$ resonant subsystem from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) determination of $\pi\pi\pi$ scattering amplitudes for the isospin-2 channel with angular momentum and parity $J^{P} = 1^+$. The calculation is performed using unphysically heavy light-quark masses, corresponding to a pion mass of $m_{\pi} \approx 400$~MeV, for which the $\rho$ meson manifests as a narrow resonance. The analysis employs a previously developed formalism that non-perturbatively relates the finite-volume spectra of two- and three-pion systems to their infinite-volume scattering amplitudes. We combine earlier lattice QCD results for $\pi\pi$ systems with isospins 1 and 2 with new determinations of the isospin-2 three-pion finite-volume spectrum, obtained for three cubic, periodic lattice volumes with box length ranging from $\approx 4/m_\pi$ to $6/m_\pi$. These combined data constrain the low-lying partial waves of the infinite-volume three-pion K matrix, from which we solve a set of coupled integral equations to extract the corresponding scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Universal Features of Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Large-$N$ QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the universal features of chiral symmetry breaking in large-$N$ QCD by comparing non-perturbative determinations of the low-lying Dirac spectrum with chiral Random Matrix Theory (RMT) predictions. Our numerical Monte Carlo calculations are based on a chiral lattice discretization of the Dirac operator, and exploit twisted volume reduction to reach $N$ as large as 841. Matching lattice data with RMT analytic results, we are able to extract the large-$N$ chiral condensate, which is compared with a recent determination obtained with non-chiral Wilson quarks from twisted volume-reduced models.</description>

      <title>Scaling flow-based approaches for topology sampling in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a methodology based on out-of-equilibrium simulations to mitigate topological freezing when approaching the continuum limit of lattice gauge theories. We reduce the autocorrelation of the topological charge employing open boundary conditions, while removing exactly their unphysical effects using a non-equilibrium Monte Carlo approach in which periodic boundary conditions are gradually switched on. We perform a detailed analysis of the computational costs of this strategy in the case of the four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Yang-Mills theory. After achieving full control of the scaling, we outline a clear strategy to sample topology efficiently in the continuum limit, which we check at lattice spacings as small as $0.045$ fm. We also generalize this approach by designing a customized Stochastic Normalizing Flow for evolutions in the boundary conditions, obtaining superior performances with respect to the purely stochastic non-equilibrium approach, and paving the way for more efficient future flow-based solutions.</description>

      <title>Spectral functions in Minkowski quantum electrodynamics from neural reconstruction: Benchmarking against dispersive Dyson--Schwinger integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Minkowskian physics-informed neural network approach (M--PINN) is formulated to solve the Dyson--Schwinger integral equations (DSE) of quantum electrodynamics (QED) directly in Minkowski spacetime. Our novel strategy merges two complementary approaches: (i) a dispersive solver based on Lehmann representations and subtracted dispersion relations, and (ii) a M--PINN that learns the fermion mass function $B(p^2)$, under the same truncation and renormalization configuration (quenched, rainbow, Landau gauge) with the loss integrating the DSE residual with multi--scale regularization, and monotonicity/smoothing penalties in the spacelike branch in the same way as in our previous work in Euclidean space. The benchmarks show quantitative agreement from the infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV) scales in both on-shell and momentum-subtraction schemes. In this controlled setting, our M--PINN reproduces the dispersive solution whilst remaining computationally compact and differentiable, paving the way for extensions with realistic vertices, unquenching effects, and uncertainty-aware variants.</description>

      <title>Advanced parametrisations for hadronic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rich analytic structure of hadronic form factors makes a theoretically consistent yet easily applicable parametrisation cumbersome. Consequently, most parametrisations are limited to reproducing the simplest analytic features sufficient to describe form factors on their first Riemann sheet. Here, we introduce two novel form factor parametrisations that allow resonance poles and left-hand cuts on the second Riemann sheet to be studied, while also making the connection to partial-wave amplitudes manifest.</description>

      <title>$QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ Quark System and Gauge/String Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>

      <title>Comments on "Non-local Nucleon Matrix Elements in the Rest Frame"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, "Non-local Nucleon Matrix Elements in the Rest Frame" (Phys. Rev. D 111, 5 (2025)), it was observed that the next-to-leading order calculations of the renormalization factor can describe, to a few percent accuracy, the logarithm of the lattice QCD rest frame matrix elements with separations up to distances of 0.6 fm on multiple lattice spacings. We argue that perturbative QCD breaks down at such a distance scale after resumming the associated large logarithms, while the ansatz used in the analysis there is not justified in perturbation theory. Besides, we explain the observation in Phys. Rev. D 111, 5 (2025) and demonstrate that the ansatz fails to describe the data for $z&gt;0.3$ fm, showing an opposite trend. Finally, although Phys. Rev. D 111, 5 (2025) proposes multiplying the ansatz by a Gaussian correction model, which is shown to reduce the discrepancy with the data, this does not legitimize the use of perturbative QCD at such distance scales.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Unpolarized Quarks at Nonzero Skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the formalism of asymmetric frames of reference for generalized parton distributions (GPDs) to the case of nonzero skewness, i.e., including longitudinal momentum transfer. The framework, based on Lorentz-invariant amplitudes and previously developed and numerically implemented for unpolarized, helicity and transversity GPDs at zero skewness, gives efficient access to a broad range of kinematics, making full mapping of GPDs from the lattice realistic. The general-skewness formalism is tested using lattice data with both transverse and longitudinal or only longitudinal momentum transfer, the latter being a special case with a reduced number of independent amplitudes. We extract the amplitudes in coordinate space and express the GPDs $H$ and $E$ in terms of these amplitudes. This is followed by reconstruction of quasi-distributions and their matching to the light cone. We further identify and discuss the principal challenges for nonzero skewness GPDs.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Diagnostics for Complex Langevin Simulations: The Role of Configurational Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex Langevin method (CLM) offers a potential solution to the sign problem in quantum field theories with complex actions, but can converge to incorrect results even when simulations appear stable. Existing diagnostics monitor drift distributions or Langevin-time operators but do not explicitly test whether configurations are sampled with the correct Boltzmann statistical weight. We propose a complementary diagnostic based on configurational temperature, constructed from gradients and Hessians of the action. Testing in one-dimensional PT-symmetric models demonstrates 0.2-3\% accuracy in reproducing input temperatures. Crucially, configurational temperature detects algorithmic errors -- including noise mis-scaling, step-size artifacts, and incomplete thermalization -- significantly more sensitively than existing drift-based or operator-based criteria. The method relies on the derivatives of the local action, making it applicable to general lattice theories, though computational cost requires consideration in higher dimensions. Our results suggest configurational temperature as a valuable addition to CLM diagnostics, complementing existing tools with potential applications from supersymmetric matrix models to lattice QCD at finite density.</description>

      <title>Investigation of triply heavy spin-3/2 baryons in their ground and excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the masses and residues of triply heavy baryons with spin-3/2, including $\Omega^*_{ccc}$, $\Omega^*_{ccb}$, $\Omega^*_{bbc}$ and $\Omega^*_{bbb}$, using the QCD sum rules method. Our calculations primarily focus on obtaining the masses of the first three resonances, that is, the ground state (1S), the first orbital excited state (1P), and the first radial excited state (2S), for the mentioned baryons. We additionally determine the residues of these baryons, which serve as key parameters for studying their possible decay channels and interactions with other particles. To achieve higher accuracy compared to previous studies, we consider nonperturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We present our calculated outcomes in two distinct energy schemes, referred to as pole and $\mathrm{\overline{MS}}$. Given the absence of experimental data for these states, we compare our results with previous theoretical calculations that are reported in relevant studies employing various approaches. These results may provide valuable insights for experimental groups searching for the triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Decays of the vector charmonium and bottomonium hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full widths of the vector charmonium and bottomonium hybrid mesons $H_{ \mathrm{c}}$ and $H_{\mathrm{b}}$, characterized by the quantum numbers $1^{ \mathrm{--}}$, are determined by analyzing their dominant strong decay modes: $H_{\mathrm{c}} \to D^{+}D^{-}$, $D_{0}\overline{D}_{0}$, $ D_{s}^{+}D_{s}^{-} $ and $H_{\mathrm{b}} \to B^{+}B^{-}$, $B_{0}\overline{B} _{0}$. To evaluate the partial widths of these channels, we employ the QCD three-point sum rule approach, which provides a reliable method for extracting the strong coupling constants at the relevant hybrid-meson-meson interaction vertices. Based on this analysis, the full widths of these hybrid quarkonia are found to be $\Gamma _{H_{\mathrm{c}}} =(234.1\pm 37.4)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ and $\Gamma _{H_{\mathrm{b}}} =(78.8\pm 15.4)~\mathrm{MeV} $ . These results are expected to facilitate the interpretation of future experimental data concerning the spectroscopy and decay patterns of exotic charmonium- and bottomonium-like hybrid mesons.</description>
