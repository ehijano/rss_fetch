      <title>Provenance Guided Rollback Suggestions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in incremental Datalog evaluation strategies have made Datalog popular among use cases with constantly evolving inputs such as static analysis in continuous integration and deployment pipelines. As a result, new logic programming debugging techniques are needed to support these emerging use cases.
  This paper introduces an incremental debugging technique for Datalog, which determines the failing changes for a \emph{rollback} in an incremental setup. Our debugging technique leverages a novel incremental provenance method. We have implemented our technique using an incremental version of the Souffl\'{e} Datalog engine and evaluated its effectiveness on the DaCapo Java program benchmarks analyzed by the Doop static analysis library. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, we can localize faults and suggest rollbacks with an overall speedup of over 26.9$\times$ while providing higher quality results.</description>

      <title>Graded Courrent PDL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propositional Dynamic Logic, PDL, is a modal logic designed to formalize the reasoning about programs. By extending accessibility between states to states and state sets, concurrent propositional dynamic logic CPDL, is introduced to include concurrent programs due to Peleg and Goldblatt. We study a many-valued generalization of CPDL where the satisfiability and the reachability relation between states and state sets are graded over a finite {\L}ukasiewicz chain. Finitely-valued dynamic logic has been shown to be useful in formalizing reasoning about program behaviors under uncertainty. We obtain completeness results for all finitely valued PDL.</description>

      <title>First Experiments with Neural cvc5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: he cvc5 solver is today one of the strongest systems for solving first order problems with theories but also without them. In this work we equip its enumeration-based instantiation with a neural network that guides the choice of the quantified formulas and their instances. For that we develop a relatively fast graph neural network that repeatedly scores all available instantiation options with respect to the available formulas. The network runs directly on a CPU without the need for any special hardware. We train the neural guidance on a large set of proofs generated by the e-matching instantiation strategy and evaluate its performance on a set of previously unseen problems.</description>

      <title>Verified and Optimized Implementation of Orthologic Proof Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of an optimized and verified decision procedure for orthologic equalities and inequalities. We start by formalizing, in the Coq proof assistant, a proof system in sequent-calculus style for orthologic. We then prove its soundness and completeness with respect to the algebraic variety of ortholattices, and we formalize a cut-elimination theorem (in doing so, we discover and fix a missing case in a previously published proof).
  We then implement and verify a complete decision procedure for orthologic. To obtain an optimal quadratic runtime, we optimize the implementation by memoizing its results and simulating reference equality testing. We leverage the resulting correctness theorem to implement a reflective Coq tactic.</description>

      <title>HpC: A Calculus for Hybrid and Mobile Systems -- Full Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked cybernetic and physical systems of the Internet of Things (IoT) immerse civilian and industrial infrastructures into an interconnected and dynamic web of hybrid and mobile devices. The key feature of such systems is the hybrid and tight coupling of mobile and pervasive discrete communications in a continuously evolving environment (discrete computations with predominant continuous dynamics). In the aim of ensuring the correctness and reliability of such heterogeneous infrastructures, we introduce the hybrid {\pi}-calculus (HpC), to formally capture both mobility, pervasiveness and hybridisation in infrastructures where the network topology and its communicating entities evolve continuously in the physical world. The {\pi}-calculus proposed by Robin Milner et al. is a process calculus that can model mobile communications and computations in a very elegant manner. The HpC we propose is a conservative extension of the classical {\pi}-calculus, i.e., the extension is ``minimal'', and yet describes mobility, time and physics of systems, while allowing to lift all theoretical results (e.g. bisimulation) to the context of that extension. We showcase the HpC by considering a realistic handover protocol among mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Proofs as Execution Trees for the {\pi}-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the foundations of a novel logical framework for the {\pi}-calculus, based on the deduction-as-computation paradigm. Following the standard proof-theoretic interpretation of logic programming, we represent processes as formulas, and we interpret proofs as computations.
  For this purpose, we define a cut-free sequent calculus for an extension of first-order multiplicative and additive linear logic. This extension includes a non-commutative and non-associative connective to faithfully model the prefix operator, and nominal quantifiers to represent name restriction. Finally, we design proof nets providing canonical representatives of derivations up to local rule permutations.</description>

      <title>Technical Report: Exploring Automatic Model-Checking of the Ethereum specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate automated model-checking of the Ethereum specification, focusing on the Accountable Safety property of the 3SF consensus protocol. We select 3SF due to its relevance and the unique challenges it poses for formal verification. Our primary tools are TLA+ for specification and the Apalache model checker for verification.
  Our formalization builds on the executable Python specification of 3SF. To begin, we manually translate this specification into TLA+, revealing significant combinatorial complexity in the definition of Accountable Safety. To address these challenges, we introduce several layers of manual abstraction: (1) replacing recursion with folds, (2) substituting abstract graphs with integers, and (3) decomposing chain configurations. To cross-validate our results, we develop alternative encodings in SMT (CVC5) and Alloy.
  Despite the inherent complexity, our results demonstrate that exhaustive verification of Accountable Safety is feasible for small instances - supporting up to 7 checkpoints and 24 validator votes. Moreover, no violations of Accountable Safety are observed, even in slightly larger configurations. Beyond these findings, our study highlights the importance of manual abstraction and domain expertise in enhancing model-checking efficiency and showcases the flexibility of TLA+ for managing intricate specifications.</description>

      <title>Characterising memory in infinite games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12044v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with games of infinite duration played over potentially infinite graphs. Recently, Ohlmann (LICS 2022) presented a characterisation of objectives admitting optimal positional strategies, by means of universal graphs: an objective is positional if and only if it admits well-ordered monotone universal graphs. We extend Ohlmann's characterisation to encompass (finite or infinite) memory upper bounds.
  We prove that objectives admitting optimal strategies with $\varepsilon$-memory less than $m$ (a memory that cannot be updated when reading an $\varepsilon$-edge) are exactly those which admit well-founded monotone universal graphs whose antichains have size bounded by $m$. We also give a characterisation of chromatic memory by means of appropriate universal structures. Our results apply to finite as well as infinite memory bounds (for instance, to objectives with finite but unbounded memory, or with countable memory strategies).
  We illustrate the applicability of our framework by carrying out a few case studies, we provide examples witnessing limitations of our approach, and we discuss general closure properties which follow from our results.</description>

      <title>On the generalized coloring numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{coloring number} $\mathrm{col}(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is equal to the \emph{degeneracy} of $G$ plus one, provides a very useful measure for the uniform sparsity of $G$. The coloring number is generalized by three series of measures, the \emph{generalized coloring numbers}. These are the \emph{$r$-admissibility} $\mathrm{adm}_r(G)$, the \emph{strong $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{col}_r(G)$ and the \emph{weak $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)$, where $r$ is an integer parameter. The generalized coloring numbers measure the edge density of bounded-depth minors and thereby provide an even more uniform measure of sparsity of graphs. They have found many applications in graph theory and in particular play a key role in the theory of bounded expansion and nowhere dense graph classes introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. We overview combinatorial and algorithmic applications of the generalized coloring numbers, emphasizing new developments in this area. We also present a simple proof for the existence of uniform orders and improve known bounds, e.g., for the weak coloring numbers on graphs with excluded topological minors.</description>
