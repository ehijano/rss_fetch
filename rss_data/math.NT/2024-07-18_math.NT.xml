      <title>Heegner point constructions and fundamental units in cubic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of nontrivial rational Heegner points on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + p$ when $p \equiv 5 \pmod{36}$ and $h_K$ is odd, and on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - p$ when $p \equiv 23 \pmod{36}$ and $h_K$ is odd. This follows from our expression for the fundamental unit of the non-Galois cubic extension $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{p})$ in terms of the class number $h_K$ and the norm of a special value of a modular function of level $6$ for any odd prime $p \equiv 2$ or $5 \pmod{9}$, which is an analogue of a theorem of Dirichlet in 1840 expressing the fundamental unit of a real quadratic field in terms of the class number and a product of cyclotomic units.</description>

      <title>Sum of Consecutive Terms of Pell and Related Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study new identities related to the sums of adjacent terms in the Pell sequence, defined by $P_{n} := 2P_{n-1}+P_{n-2}$ for $ n\geq 2$ and $P_{0}=0, P_{1}=1$, and generalize these identities for many similar sequences. We prove that the sum of $N&gt;1$ consecutive Pell numbers is a fixed integer multiple of another Pell number if and only if $4\mid N$. We consider the generalized Pell $(k,i)$-numbers defined by $p(n) :=\ 2p(n-1)+p(n-k-1) $ for $n\geq k+1$, with $p(0)=p(1)=\cdots =p(i)=0$ and $p(i+1)=\cdots = p(k)=1$ for $0\leq i\leq k-1$, and prove that the sum of $N=2k+2$ consecutive terms is a fixed integer multiple of another term in the sequence. We also prove that for the generalized Pell $(k,k-1)$-numbers such a relation does not exist when $N$ and $k$ are odd. We give analogous results for the Fibonacci and other related second-order recursive sequences.</description>

      <title>On the representation of number-theoretic functions by arithmetic terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present closed forms for several functions that are fundamental in number theory and we explain the method used to obtain them. Concretely, we find formulas for the p-adic valuation, the number-of-divisors function, the sum-of-divisors function, Euler's totient function, the modular inverse, the integer part of the root, the integer part of the logarithm, the multiplicative order and the discrete logarithm. Although these are very complicated, they only involve elementary operations, and to our knowledge no other closed form of this kind is known for the aforementioned functions.</description>

      <title>On the Exceptional Sets of $p$-adic Transcendental Analytic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the exceptional sets $S_f$ of $p$-adic transcendental analytic functions $f$ with rational and algebraic coefficients. We establish a necessary condition for a subset $S \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{Q}} \cap B(0, \rho)$ to be the exceptional set of a $p$-adic transcendental analytic function with rational coefficients, demonstrating that, in general, the answer to Mahler's Problem C over $\mathbb{C}_p$ is negative. However, we prove that if $S$ is closed under algebraic conjugation and contains 0, there exist uncountably many transcendental analytic functions $f \in \mathbb{Q}_{\rho}[[z]]$ such that $S_f = S$. Furthermore, if $\rho \geq 1$, $f$ can be taken in $\mathbb{Z}_{\rho}[[z]]$. Additionally, we demonstrate that any $S \subseteq \overline{\mathbb{Q}} \cap B(0, \rho)$ containing 0 can be the exceptional set of uncountably many transcendental analytic functions $f \in \overline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\rho}[[z]]$.</description>

      <title>The discrepancy of the Champernowne constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number is normal in base $b$ if, in its base $b$ expansion, all blocks of digits of equal length have the same asymptotic frequency. The rate at which a number approaches normality is quantified by the classical notion of discrepancy, which indicates how far the scaling of the number by powers of $b$ is from being equidistributed modulo 1. This rate is known as the discrepancy of a normal number. The Champernowne constant $c_{10} = 0.12345678910111213141516\ldots$ is the most well-known example of a normal number. In 1986, Schiffer provided the discrepancy of numbers in a family that includes the Champernowne constant. His proof relies on exponential sums. Here, we present a discrete and elementary proof specifically for the discrepancy of the Champernowne constant.</description>

      <title>Critical values of $L$-functions of residual representations of $\mathrm{GL}_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove rationality results of critical values for $L$-functions attached to representations in the residual spectrum of $\mathrm{GL}_4(\mathbb{A})$. We use the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence to describe their partial $L$-functions via cuspidal automorphic representations of the group $\mathrm{GL}_2'(\mathbb{A})$ over a quaternion algebra. Using ideas inspired by results of Grobner and Raghuram we are then able to compute the critical values as a Shalika period up to a rational multiple.</description>

      <title>Petersson Inner Products and Whittaker--Fourier Periods on Even Special Orthogonal and Symplectic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we would like to formulate a relation between the square norm of Whittaker--Fourier coefficients on even special orthogonal and symplectic groups and Petersson inner products along with the critical value of $L$-functions up to constants. We follow the path of Lapid and Mao to reduce it to the conjectural local identity. Our strategy is based on the work of Ginzburg--Rallis--Soudry on automorphic descent. We present the analogue result for odd special orthogonal groups, which is conditional on unfolding Whittaker functions of descents.</description>

      <title>Moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda_X(s)=\det(I-sX^{\dagger})$ be the characteristic polynomial of the unitary matrix $X$. It is believed that the distribution of values of $\Lambda_X(s)$ model the distribution of values of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. This principle motivates many avenues of study. Of particular interest is the behavior of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ and the distribution of its zeros (all of which lie inside or on the unit circle). In this article we present several identities for the moments of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ averaged over $U(N)$, for $x \in \mathbb{C}$ as well as specialized to $|x|=1$. Additionally, we prove, for positive integer $k$, that the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X(1)|^{2k} dX$ of degree $k^2$ in $N$ divides the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X'(1)|^{2k} dX$ which is of degree $k^2+2k$ in $N$ and that the ratio, $f(N,k)$, of these moments factors into linear factors modulo $4k-1$ if $4k-1$ is prime. We also discuss the relationship of these moments to a solution of a second order non-linear Painl\'{e}ve differential equation. Finally we give some formulas in terms of the $_3F_2$ hypergeometric series for the moments in the simplest case when $N=2$, and also study the radial distribution of the zeros of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ in that case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we study common preperiodic points of rational maps of the Riemann Sphere. We show that given any degrees $d_1,d_2\geq2$, outside a Zariski closed subset of the space of pairs of rational maps $(f,g)$ of degree $d_1$ and $d_2$ respectively, the maps $f$ and $g$ share at most a uniformly bounded number of common preperiodic points. This generalizes a result of DeMarco and Mavraki to maps of possibly different degrees. Our main contribution is the use of H\"older properties of the Green function of a rational map to obtain height estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Fourier transform of BV functions. We obtain an averaged Plancherel formula for BV functions and a characterisation of sets of finite perimeter in terms of their Fourier transform. We also sharpen a result of Herz concerning the "set derivative" of the Fourier transform of the characteristic function of a set. Finally, we obtain a new proof of the isoperimetric inequality and sharp bounds on the $L^2$-discrepancy of BV functions.</description>

Abstract: For a prime $p$ and a rational elliptic curve $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$, set $K=\mathbb{Q}(E[p])$ to denote the torsion field generated by $E[p]:=\operatorname{ker}\{E\xrightarrow{p} E\}$. The class group $\operatorname{Cl}_K$ is a module over $\operatorname{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$. Given a fixed odd prime number $p$, we study the average non-vanishing of certain Galois stable quotients of the mod-$p$ class group $\operatorname{Cl}_K/p\operatorname{Cl}_K$. Here, $E$ varies over rational elliptic curves, ordered according to \emph{height}. Our results are conditional and rely on predictions made by Delaunay and Poonen-Rains for the statistical variation of the $p$-primary parts of Tate-Shafarevich groups of elliptic curves. We also prove results in the case when the elliptic curve $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$ is fixed and the prime $p$ is allowed to vary.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ be a real arithmetic function and let $g:[1,\infty[\to{\mathbb R}$ be a smooth function. We describe two emblematic instances in which saddle-point estimates may be used to evaluate the frequency, on the set of integers $n\leqslant x$, of the event $\{f(n)\leqslant g(n)\}$ from those relevant to the event $\{f(n)\leqslant y\}$. The first example revisits Dickman's historical contribution to the theory of friable integers. The second is concerned with the distribution of the squarefree kernel of an integer.</description>

Abstract: For any fixed relatively prime positive integers $a,b$ and $c$ greater than 1, we consider the equation $a^x+b^y=c^z$ in positive integers $x,y$ and $z$. In this note, assuming the truth of $abc$-conjecture, for any fixed $c$ we prove that there is at most one solution to the equation, except for only finitely many pairs of $a$ and $b$. This answers a question in the paper of Miyazaki and Pink [T. Miyazaki and I. Pink, Number of solutions to a special type of unit equations in two unknowns, III, arXiv:2403.20037].</description>

      <title>Motivic distribution of rational curves and twisted products of toric varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work concerns asymptotical stabilisation phenomena occurring in the moduli space of sections of certain algebraic families over a smooth projective curve, whenever the generic fibre of the family is a smooth projective Fano variety, or not far from being Fano.
  We describe the expected behaviour of the class, in a ring of motivic integration, of the moduli space of sections of given numerical class. Up to an adequate normalisation, it should converge, when the class of the sections goes arbitrarily far from the boundary of the dual of the effective cone, to an effective element given by a motivic Euler product. Such a principle can be seen as an analogue for rational curves of the Batyrev-Manin-Peyre principle for rational points.
  The central tool of this article is the property of equidistribution of curves. We show that this notion does not depend on the choice of a model of the generic fibre, and that equidistribution of curves holds for smooth projective split toric varieties. As an application, we study the Batyrev-Manin-Peyre principle for curves on a certain kind of twisted products.</description>

      <title>Randomisation in the Josephus Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephus problem is a well--studied elimination problem consisting in determining the position of the survivor after repeated applications of a deterministic rule removing one person at a time from a given group.
  A natural probabilistic variant of this process is introduced in this paper. More precisely, in this variant, the survivor is determined after performing a succession of Bernouilli trials with parameter $p$ designating each time the person to remove. When the number of participants tends to infinity, the main result characterises the limit distribution of the position of the survivor with an increasing degree of precision as the parameter approaches the unbiaised case $p=1/2$. Then, the convergence rate to the position of the survivor is obtained in the form of a Central-Limit Theorem.
  A number of other variants of the suggested probabilistic elimination process are also considered. They each admit a specific limit behavior which, in most cases, is stated in the form of an open problem.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and $k \geq 2$ be an integer. We prove that every $K$-linear bijection $f : K[X] \to K[X]$ strongly preserving the set of $k$-free polynomials (or the set of polynomials with a $k$-fold root in $K$) is a constant multiple of a $K$-algebra automorphism of $K[X]$, i.e., there are elements $a, c \in K^{\times}$, $b \in K$ such that $f(P)(X) = c P(a X + b)$. When $K$ is a number field or $K=\mathbb{R}$, we prove that similar statements hold when $f$ preserves the set of polynomials with a root in $K$.</description>
