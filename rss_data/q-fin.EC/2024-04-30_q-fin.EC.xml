      <title>Revisiting the Resource Curse in the Age of Energy Transition: Cobalt Reserves and Conflict in Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reevaluates the traditional understanding of the "political resource curse" by examining the unique impact of energy transition metals, specifically cobalt, on local-level conflicts in Africa. Contrary to previous studies that primarily focus on high-value minerals and their political outcomes resulted from substantial economic revenues, this study investigates cobalt's influence on local conflict. Despite its strategic importance, cobalt's limited commercial value presents a unique yet critical case for analysis. Different with the prevailing view that links mineral reserves with increased conflict, this research finds that regions rich in cobalt experience a reduction in conflict. This decrease is attributed to enhanced government security measures, which are implemented independently of the economic benefits derived from cobalt as a commodity. The study utilizes a combination of georeferenced data and a difference-in-difference design to analyze the causal relationship between cobalt deposits and regional conflict. The findings suggest that the presence of cobalt deposits leads to enhanced security interventions by governments, effectively reducing the likelihood of non-governmental actors taking control of these territories. This pattern offers a new perspective on the role of energy transition metals in shaping conflict and governance, highlighting the need to reassess theoretical frameworks related to the political implications of natural resources with the ongoing energy revolution.</description>

      <title>Exit Spillovers of Foreign-invested Enterprises in Shenzhen's Electronics Manufacturing Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neighborhood characteristics have been broadly studied with different firm behaviors, e.g. birth, entry, expansion, and survival, except for firm exit. Using a novel dataset of foreign-invested enterprises operating in Shenzhen's electronics manufacturing industry from 2017 to 2021, I investigate the spillover effects of firm exits on other firms in the vicinity, from both the industry group and the industry class level. Significant neighborhood effects are identified for the industry group level, but not the industry class level.</description>

      <title>Strategic Behavior and AI Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-created works represent critical data inputs to artificial intelligence (AI). Strategic behavior can play a major role for AI training datasets, be it in limiting access to existing works or in deciding which types of new works to create or whether to create new works at all. We examine creators' behavioral change when their works become training data for AI. Specifically, we focus on contributors on Unsplash, a popular stock image platform with about 6 million high-quality photos and illustrations. In the summer of 2020, Unsplash launched an AI research program by releasing a dataset of 25,000 images for commercial use. We study contributors' reactions, comparing contributors whose works were included in this dataset to contributors whose works were not included. Our results suggest that treated contributors left the platform at a higher-than-usual rate and substantially slowed down the rate of new uploads. Professional and more successful photographers react stronger than amateurs and less successful photographers. We also show that affected users changed the variety and novelty of contributions to the platform, with long-run implications for the stock of works potentially available for AI training. Taken together, our findings highlight the trade-off between interests of rightsholders and promoting innovation at the technological frontier. We discuss implications for copyright and AI policy.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Tools for Time Series Analysis in Natural Language Processing: A Practitioners Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language processing tools have become frequently used in social sciences such as economics, political science, and sociology. Many publications apply topic modeling to elicit latent topics in text corpora and their development over time. Here, most publications rely on visual inspections and draw inference on changes, structural breaks, and developments over time. We suggest using univariate time series econometrics to introduce more quantitative rigor that can strengthen the analyses. In particular, we discuss the econometric topics of non-stationarity as well as structural breaks. This paper serves as a comprehensive practitioners guide to provide researchers in the social and life sciences as well as the humanities with concise advice on how to implement econometric time series methods to thoroughly investigate topic prevalences over time. We provide coding advice for the statistical software R throughout the paper. The application of the discussed tools to a sample dataset completes the analysis.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Peer Review in Open Science: A Mechanism Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer review is a laborious, yet essential, part of academic publishing with crucial impact on the scientific endeavor. The current lack of incentives and transparency harms the credibility of this process. Researchers are neither rewarded for superior nor penalized for bad reviews. Additionally, confidential reports cause a loss of insights and make the review process vulnerable to scientific misconduct. We propose a community-owned and -governed system that 1) remunerates reviewers for their efforts, 2) publishes the (anonymized) reports for scrutiny by the community, 3) tracks reputation of reviewers and 4) provides digital certificates. Automated by transparent smart-contract blockchain technology, the system aims to increase quality and speed of peer review while lowering the chance and impact of erroneous judgements.</description>

      <title>To VaR, or Not to VaR, That is the Question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.08559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider economic obstacles that limit the reliability and accuracy of value-at-risk (VaR). Investors who manage large market transactions should take into account the impact of the randomness of large trade volumes on predictions of price probability and VaR assessments. We introduce market-based probabilities of price and return that depend on the randomness of market trade values and volumes. Contrary to them, the conventional frequency-based price probability describes the case of constant trade volumes. We derive the dependence of market-based price volatility on the volatilities and correlation of trade values and volumes. In the coming years, that will limit the accuracy of price probability predictions to Gaussian approximations, and even the forecasts of market-based price volatility will be inaccurate and highly uncertain.</description>

      <title>Life after (Soft) Default</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft default, defined as a delinquency of 90 days or more, is a relatively common event in the credit market, in 2010 such episodes affected about 3 million individuals. Yet we lack a detailed understanding of what happens afterward. We use credit report data, on approximately 2 million individuals from 2004 to 2020, to shed light on individual trajectories after such event, and document enduring negative impacts. These effects persist for up to ten years post-event and manifest in lower credit scores, reduced total credit limits, lower homeownership rates, lower income, and relocation to less economically active zip codes. It appears that those who are overextended in their mortgage lines, and with larger delinquent amounts, suffer the harshest consequences.</description>

      <title>Fake Google restaurant reviews and the implications for consumers and restaurants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of online reviews to aid with purchase decisions is popular among consumers as it is a simple heuristic tool based on the reported experiences of other consumers. However, not all online reviews are written by real consumers or reflect actual experiences, and present implications for consumers and businesses. This study examines the effects of fake online reviews written by artificial intelligence (AI) on consumer decision making. Respondents were surveyed about their attitudes and habits concerning online reviews using an online questionnaire (n=351), and participated in a restaurant choice experiment using varying proportions of fake and real reviews. While the findings confirm prior studies, new insights are gained about the confusion for consumers and consequences for businesses when reviews written by AI are believed rather than real reviews. The study presents a fake review detection model using logistic regression modeling to score and flag reviews as a solution.</description>

      <title>Global Shipyard Capacities Limiting the Ramp-Up of Global Hydrogen Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decarbonizing the global energy system requires significant expansions of renewable energy technologies. Given that cost-effective renewable sources are not necessarily situated in proximity to the largest energy demand centers globally, the maritime transportation of low-carbon energy carriers, such as renewable-based hydrogen or ammonia, will be needed. However, whether existent shipyards possess the required capacity to provide the necessary global fleet has not yet been answered. Therefore, this study estimates global tanker demand based on projections for global hydrogen demand, while comparing these projections with historic shipyard production. Our findings reveal a potential bottleneck until 2033-2039 if relying on liquefied hydrogen exclusively. This bottleneck could be circumvented by increasing local hydrogen production, utilizing pipelines, or liquefied ammonia as an energy carrier for hydrogen. Furthermore, the regional concentration of shipyard locations raises concerns about diversification. Increasing demand for container vessels could substantially hinder the scale-up of maritime hydrogen transport.</description>

      <title>Repetitive Dilemma Games in Distribution Information Using Interplay of Droop Quota: Meek's Method in Impact of Maximum Compensation and Minimum Cost Routes in Information Role of Marginal Contribution in Two-Sided Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a preliminary report of the research plan and a digest of the results and discussions. On research note explores the complex dynamics of fake news dissemination and fact-checking costs within the framework of information markets and analyzes the equilibrium between supply and demand using the concepts of droop quotas, Meek's method, and marginal contributions. By adopting a two-sided matching market perspective, we delve into scenarios in which markets are stable under the influence of fake news perceived as truth and those in which credibility prevails. Through the application of iterated dilemma game theory, we investigate the strategic choices of news providers affected by the costs associated with spreading fake news and fact-checking efforts. We further examine the maximum reward problem and strategies to minimize the cost path for spreading fake news, and consider a nuanced understanding of market segmentation into "cheap" and "premium" segments based on the nature of the information being spread. Our analysis uses mathematical models and computational processes to identify stable equilibrium points that ensure market stability in the face of deceptive information practices and provide insight into effective strategies to enhance the informational health of the market. Through this comprehensive approach, this paper aims for a more truthful and reliable perspective from which to observe information markets. This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Global Sensitivity and Domain-Selective Testing for Functional-Valued Responses: An Application to Climate Economy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.13850v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics and evolution of climate change and associated uncertainties is key for designing robust policy actions. Computer models are key tools in this scientific effort, which have now reached a high level of sophistication and complexity. Model auditing is needed in order to better understand their results, and to deal with the fact that such models are increasingly opaque with respect to their inner workings. Current techniques such as Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) are limited to dealing either with multivariate outputs, stochastic ones, or finite-change inputs. This limits their applicability to time-varying variables such as future pathways of greenhouse gases. To provide additional semantics in the analysis of a model ensemble, we provide an extension of GSA methodologies tackling the case of stochastic functional outputs with finite change inputs. To deal with finite change inputs and functional outputs, we propose an extension of currently available GSA methodologies while we deal with the stochastic part by introducing a novel, domain-selective inferential technique for sensitivity indices. Our method is explored via a simulation study that shows its robustness and efficacy in detecting sensitivity patterns. We apply it to real world data, where its capabilities can provide to practitioners and policymakers additional information about the time dynamics of sensitivity patterns, as well as information about robustness.</description>
