      <title>Hunting for a 17 MeV particle coupled to electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a set of precision observables that can probe the existence of a light particle $X$ coupled to electrons in the mass range of 1--100 MeV. As a case study, we consider the recent excess of $e^+e^-$ final-state events at $\sqrt{s} = 16.9$ MeV reported by the PADME collaboration. Interestingly, this mass is tantalizingly close to the invariant mass at which anomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states by the ATOMKI collaboration. For the scenario in which the new particle has a vector coupling to electrons, we show that the PADME excess is already in tension with constraints from the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the non-observation of the exotic pion and muon decays $\pi^+\to e^+ \nu X$ and $\mu^+ \to e^+ \bar\nu_\mu\nu_e X$ at the SINDRUM experiment. Further improvements in the measurement of the electron $g$-2, together with upcoming results from the Mu3e and PIONEER experiments, are expected to definitively probe this scenario in the near future. We also explore alternative possibilities where the new particle has scalar, pseudoscalar, or axial-vector couplings.</description>

      <title>Probing light axion-like particle via primordial black hole evaporation with gamma-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion-like particle (ALP) and primordial black hole (PBH) are two representative dark matter (DM) candidates as light bosonic DM and macroscopic objects, respectively. In this work, we investigate the gamma-ray production mechanisms induced by PBH evaporation and ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$. The detection of gamma-rays is also explored in future satellite telescopes, including AMEGO, e-ASTROGAM and MAST. We first propose the evaporation-conversion scenario in which light ALPs are emitted by PBHs and are converted into photons in the presence of magnetic field in the Universe. The second scenario assumes ALPs as dominant DM component in the Milky Way and considers the relativistic electron production from PBH evaporation. The emitted electrons scatter off non-relativistic ALP in DM halo and produce gamma-rays through the ALP-photon coupling. Using the Fisher forecasting method, we calculate the gamma-ray energy spectra from these two scenarios and derive projected sensitivity for the fraction of DM composed of PBHs $f_{\rm PBH}$ and ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic moment of neutrinos in a left-right symmetric model and Interplay of type-I and type-II seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In left-right symmetric models, the Majorana coupling matrix, $f$, and hence the right-handed neutrino (RHN) mass matrix, admits eight solutions assuming the form of Dirac coupling matrix is known. Additionally, the coupling matrix depends on the parity-breaking scale, $v_R$, as a new physics scale. RHNs being Majorana in nature can possess a transition magnetic moment (TMM). Neutrino magnetic moments are inherently related to neutrino masses, as neutrino masses imply neutrino magnetic moments. We study, along with small neutrino TMM, the heavy RHN transition magnetic moment contributions to muon $g-2$, $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly for all eight solutions of $f$. We find, of the eight solutions, only two solutions of $f$ matrix contribute to the $(g-2)_\mu$ in the experimental predicted range. The range of $v_R$ in these cases is found to be $3.4 \times 10^3 - 1.5 \times 10^4$ GeV. For a complementary check, we also study TMM induced neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$), for the same set of choice of parameters. While certain parameter choices allow RHNs to explain the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, the same configurations lead to an extremely long half-life for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, well beyond experimental reach. Even under extreme magnetic field enhancements, the half-life decreases only marginally, reinforcing the dominance of weak interaction vertices over TMM contributions in $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of angular correlations in the associated top quark and the dark matter mediator production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the process of single top quark production within the "simplified model" with a scalar dark matter mediator, a new variable based on angular correlations was presented, for the proper reconstruction of which it is necessary to separate the contributions of two undetectable particles: the neutrino and the mediator. In this work, various machine learning approaches for reconstructing the momenta of these particles are analyzed. A comparison is made between the results obtained using a multilayer perceptron and the Normalizing Flows architectures. The neural networks based on Normalizing Flows, presented in this work, demonstrate a high quality of reconstruction of the target variable and can be used for collider data analysis.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic quark propagation and Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of a constant external magnetic field on the dressed propagators of up-, down-, and strange quarks. In the weak field limit, we derive a general momentum-space representation for the propagator and numerically solve the corresponding gap equation. Our analysis reveals that the vector term of the propagator can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, resulting in anisotropic effective masses, with the transverse mass consistently exceeding the longitudinal mass. This mass disparity exhibits a power law dependence on the magnetic field strength and is less pronounced for the strange quark compared to up and down quarks. Additionally, the magnetic field induces axial-vector and tensor terms, highlighting the Zeeman effect resulting from quark interactions with the magnetic field. These findings have important implications for (inverse) magnetic catalysis, and phenomena such as vector meson and pion condensations.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter in 2HDMS at LHC and future Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenological prospects of the Two Higgs Doublet and Complex Singlet Scalar Extension (2HDMS) in the context of dark matter (DM) and Higgs phenomenology. The 2HDMS provides an enlarged Higgs sector along with a DM candidate. In this work, we perform an exhaustive scan to find representative benchmarks which are consistent with all theoretical and experimental constraints. We choose benchmarks with light, intermediate and massive DM masses and in some cases, also accommodate the 95 GeV excess in $b\bar{b}$ and $\gamma\gamma$ channels observed at the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We focus on the relevant signatures at the LHC and at proposed future lepton colliders including electron-positron and muon colliders. Using a cut and count analysis, we show that while the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) may give a hint of new physics, future lepton colliders prove to be efficient discovery probes for the 2HDMS.</description>

      <title>Updated analysis of charmonium states in a relativized quark potential model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations of charmonium(-like) states, we investigate their interpretation as conventional charmonium states within the framework of relativized quark potential model. We find a consistent description of the updated masses of charmonia, bottomonia and some selected charmed mesons, then systematically compute open-charm strong decay widths and electromagnetic transition widths for radially excited charmonium states up to $n=5$. The numerical results show significantly improved agreement with experimental masses and widths. Notably, the newly-observed $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4274)$ are tentatively associated with the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ and $\chi_{c1}(3P)$ respectively, while the $\chi_{c0}(4500)$ and $\chi_{c0}(4700)$ are interpreted as the $\chi_{c0}(4P)$ and $\chi_{c0}(5P)$ states. For the controversial $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ state, we suggest its potential connection to $\chi_{c1}(4010)$, as a two-pole structure due to the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ coupling to $D\bar{D}$ channels. Intriguingly, the predicted mass of $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ is about 3851 MeV, diverging from the original estimate of 3916 MeV in the Godfrey and Isgur's work but consistent with non-relativistic potential model predictions. This calculation might provide more insight to the future experimental investigation of charmonium(-like) states.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the $N(1535)$ in the process $\Lambda_c^+\to n\pi^+\pi^0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the $\Lambda_c^+\to n\pi^+\pi^0$ decay process using the chiral unitary approach, by considering that the nucleon resonance $N(1535)$ could be dynamically generated through $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interactions. In the invariant mass distributions of $\pi^0n$ and $\pi^+n$, we observe a distinct peak structure associated with the resonance states $N(1535)^0$ and $N(1535)^+$, respectively. Our results suggest that the $\Lambda_c^+\to n\pi^+\pi^0$ process can be utilized to probe the properties of the nucleon $N(1535)$, and therefore, we encourage more precise experimental measurements of this process in the future.</description>

      <title>Identifying triple-strangeness $\Omega$ hyperons in light of recent experimental results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically calculate the mass spectra and decay widths of $\Omega$ baryons with $N\leq3$. In our scheme, the newly observed $\Omega(2109)$ is identified as a $N=2$ candidate, with its quantum numbers tentatively assigned as $\Omega(2S,3/2^+)$. However, the experimentally measured mass exhibits a deviation of approximately 50 MeV below the theoretical predictions. The possible reason for this deviation, along with the suggestion for experiments, are discussed in this paper. Additionally, we give possible assignments of $\Omega(2012)^-$, $\Omega(2250)^-$, $\Omega(2380)^-$, and $\Omega(2470)^-$. Furthermore, we calculate the masses and widths of other missing $\Omega$ states, which could provide valuable clues for experimental searches aimed at discovering these states.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of dark sector portal leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of probing leptogenesis via stochastic gravitational waves (GW) arising from a dark sector assisted first-order electroweak phase transition. The same dark sector, with non-trivial transformation under an unbroken $Z_2$ symmetry is also responsible for providing the only source of CP asymmetry via one-loop interference with the tree level decay of a heavy right-handed neutrino into lepton and Higgs doublets. The new Yukawa and scalar portal couplings enhance the CP asymmetry allowing TeV scale leptogenesis without any resonant enhancement. Light neutrino masses arise from a combination of type-I and one-loop contributions with vanishing lightest neutrino mass. While the new degrees of freedom in sub-TeV range keep the detection prospects at terrestrial experiments promising, the new scalars enhance the strength of the electroweak phase transition keeping the GW signals within reach of near future experiments like LISA.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory treatment of neutrino spin-flavor oscillations in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spin-flavor oscillations of neutrinos in a magnetic field within the quantum field theory approach in which neutrinos are virtual particles. Neutrinos are taken to be Majorana particles having a nonzero transition magnetic moment. We derive the dressed propagators of the neutrino mass eigenstates exactly accounting for the magnetic field contribution. The matrix element and the transition probability for spin-flavor oscillations are obtained. The leading term in the transition probability is shown to coincide with the result of the standard quantum mechanical description of neutrino oscillations. We also derive the correction to the transition probability which has the quantum field theory origin.</description>

      <title>Dipionic transitions of $Y(4500)$ to $J/\psi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We, using an effective Lagrangian approach, investigated the dipionic transition of the $Y(4500)$ newly well-established in the process $e^+e^-\to K^+K^- J/\psi$. In this study, the $Y(4500)$ was considered as a mixture of the $\psi(5S)$ and $\psi(4\,{^3D_1})$, and its dipionic decay to the $J/\psi$ was assumed to occur via charmed meson loops including box and two kinds of triangle loops. The calculated invariant mass spectra due to the different loop mechanisms exhibit distinct differences. These spectrum patterns are found to be nearly independent of the cutoff parameter, especially for the box and $\mathcal{R}$ loops. By means of comparing our calculated results with the future experimental measurements of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $\pi^\pm J/\psi$ invariant mass distributions, we could judge which loop mechanism is of more importance in this dipionic transition. The interference among the different kinds of loops is also exhibited. Despite the unknown phase angles between different kinds of loop diagrams, the partial decay width for the process $Y(4500)\to\pi^+\pi^- J/\psi$ is estimated to be 250-700 keV, aligning with the estimation obtained by combining BESIII Collaboration measurements and theoretical predictions for $Y(4500)\to K^+K^- J/\psi$. We hope that the present calculations would be tested by the future BESIII or Belle II experiments.</description>

      <title>Detecting Dark Matter with Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars offer powerful astrophysical laboratories to probe the properties of dark matter. Gradual accumulation of heavy, non-annihilating dark matter in neutron stars can lead to the formation of comparable-mass black holes, and non-detection of gravitational waves from mergers of such low-mass black holes can constrain such dark matter interactions with nucleons. These constraints, though dependent on the currently uncertain binary neutron star merger rate density, are significantly more stringent than those from direct detection experiments and provide some of the strongest limits on heavy, non-annihilating dark matter interactions. Additionally, dark matter with baryon number-violating interactions can induce excess heating in cold neutron stars and is thus significantly constrained by thermal observations of cold neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Charmonium pair production in ultraperipheral collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the exclusive double charmonium ($J/\psi \mbox{-} J/\psi$ and $\eta_c \mbox{-} \eta_c$) production through photon-photon fusion via ultraperipheral collision (UPC) at the HL-LHC and FCC with next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD predictions in the framework of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). Numerical results indicate that the NLO corrections for $J/\psi$ pair are large and negative, while positive for $\eta_c$ pair. The total cross section of $J/\psi \mbox{-} J/\psi$ ($\eta_c \mbox{-} \eta_c$) in Pb-Pb UPC is 28.0 (65.1) nb at nucleon-nucleon c.m. energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.52$ TeV. Due to the backgrounds from various QCD interactions at UPC are highly suppressed and the event topologies for charmonium pair are easy to tag, the phenomenological studies at the LHC and FCC are feasible. The detailed transverse momentum $p_T$, diphoton invariant mass $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ and the rapidity difference $\Delta y$ distributions are given. The production for X(6900) is also discussed.</description>

      <title>New chiral structures for nucleon baryon number violating decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the most general nucleon decay interactions that involve three light quarks without being acted upon by a derivative. We identify four generic operator structures that correspond to the irreducible representations in the chiral group ${\rm SU(3)}_{\tt L}\otimes {\rm SU(3)}_{\tt R}$ of QCD, {$\pmb{8}_{\tt L}\otimes \pmb{1}_{\tt R}$, $\bar{\pmb{3}}_{\tt L}\otimes \pmb{3}_{\tt R}$, $\pmb{6}_{\tt L}\otimes \pmb{3}_{\tt R}$, $\pmb{10}_{\tt L}\otimes \pmb{1}_{\tt R}$}, plus their chirality partners under the interchange of chiralities ${\tt L}\leftrightarrow {\tt R}$. While half of them have been extensively discussed in the literature, the other half, $\pmb{6}_{\tt L(R)}\otimes \pmb{3}_{\tt R(L)}$ and $\bar{\pmb{10}}_{\tt L(R)}\otimes \pmb{1}_{\tt R(L)}$, are identified for the first time. We perform chiral matching for these interactions at the leading chiral order and find that each has a unique chiral realization in terms of the octet baryons and pseudoscalars. Notably, the chiral interaction in the $\pmb{6}_{\tt L(R)}\otimes \pmb{3}_{\tt R(L)}$ representation appears at the same chiral order as those of the known ones, while the one in the $\pmb{10}_{\tt L(R)}\otimes \pmb{1}_{\tt R(L)}$ representation appears at a higher chiral order. These new structures are prevalent in effective field theories and UV models, and offer novel experimental avenues to search for baryon number violating nucleon decays.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transitions for the Ground and Excited Charmonia States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the physical properties like decay constants, radiative transitions, decay widths, and branching ratios for the ground and radially excited charmonia states. For the numerical calculations, we have adopted the light-front quark model (LFQM). We have studied $\chi_{c0}\rightarrow J{/}\psi+\gamma $ and $\psi(2S)\rightarrow\chi_{c0}+\gamma$, $h_c(1P)\rightarrow\eta_c(1S)+\gamma $, and $\eta_c(2S)\rightarrow h_c(1P)+\gamma $ transitions in this work. We have also demonstrated the behavior of the transition form factors (TFFs) for the $h_c(1P)\rightarrow\eta_c(1S)+\gamma $ and $\psi(2S)\rightarrow\chi_{c0}+\gamma$ decays in this model. Using the TFFs results, we have calculated the decay widths and branching ratios for these transitions. Our numerical results of decay constants, decay widths, and branching ratios are overall in good agreement with available experimental, theoretical and lattice simulation data.</description>

      <title>Monopoles at Future Neutrino Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of future neutrino experiments, DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande, to probe magnetic monopoles via Callan-Rubakov (CR) processes. We consider both relativistic and non-relativistic monopoles and focus on two primary detection signatures: high-energy antiproton production and proton decay catalysis. For relativistic monopoles, our analysis of the CR process indicates antiproton production with energies near 900 GeV and we find that both experiments can provide limits on the fluxes an order of magnitude below the Parker bound (approximately $\Phi \lesssim 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$). For non-relativistic monopoles, we recast the experimental sensitivity to proton decay catalysis and obtain upper limits on the monopole flux of $\Phi \lesssim 2.3 \times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$ for Hyper-Kamiokande and $\Phi \lesssim 1.1 \times 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$ for DUNE.</description>

      <title>Identify hadron anomalous couplings at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the identification of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) Lagrangian at colliders such as BESIII and the Super-$\tau$-Charm Facility. Our analysis concentrates on the radiative decays of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons, including $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \gamma\gamma$, $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \gamma\ell^+ \ell^-$, $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, and $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \pi^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$, as well as semileptonic kaon decays such as $K^+ \to \pi^+\pi^- e^+ \nu_e$. Employing the hidden local symmetry framework to incorporate vector meson contributions, we compute the decay amplitudes and form factors. For the decay $\eta \to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, the box anomaly dominates, and we find that the anomalous coupling can be experimentally determined to percent-level precision at BESIII. In contrast, vector meson contributions are significant in the decay $\eta' \to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$. Using experimental data for $\eta' \to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma$, we obtain ${\cal B}_{\mathrm{box}}^{\text{exp}} = (1.70 \pm 0.05)\%$, which is approximately ten times larger than previously expected experimentally. We observe good agreement between our calculated anomalous couplings and experimental results. In kaon decays, WZW terms uniquely contribute to the form factor $H$, which can be extracted from parity-conserving decay distributions. While predictions at the chiral point closely match experimental values (e.g., $H^+ = -2.31$ versus $-2.27 \pm 0.10$), we find that intermediate vector meson states introduce substantial corrections, potentially as large as 25%. We strongly advocate for revisiting these experiments to achieve improved precision in form factor extractions.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Valence Quark Structure of the Pion through GTMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of the pion using generalized transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) within the light-cone quark model. By solving the quark-quark correlator, we derive the twist-$2$, $3$, and $4$ quark GTMDs in terms of light-front wave functions (LFWFs). Out of the $16$ possible GTMDs, $12$ are found to be nonzero. Furthermore, we extract the valence quark transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from their corresponding GTMDs. Additionally, we compute the valence quark electromagnetic form factors (FFs) and parton distribution functions (PDFs) up to twist-$4$. The elastic charge radius of the pion is determined to be $0.558$ fm. Our results exhibit a qualitative agreement with predictions from other theoretical model like Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, Light-front holographic model, and spectator model at the leading twist. This study provides a comprehensive insight into the internal structure of the pion.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the pion in the self-consistent light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-consistent light-front quark model (LFQM) analysis of the pion's gravitational form factors (GFFs), incorporating the Bakamjian-Thomas (BT) construction consistently throughout the framework. By uniformly applying the BT formalism to both hadronic matrix elements and their associated Lorentz structures, we achieve a current-component-independent extraction of the pion GFFs $A_\pi(t)$ and $D_\pi(t)$, thereby eliminating the light-front zero-mode ambiguities that typically hinder conventional LFQM approaches. By tuning the model parameters, we identify an optimal set that successfully reproduces the decay constant and electromagnetic form factor of the pion, while yielding a $D$-term value $D_\pi(0) \approx -1$, consistent with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. The $D$-term emerges as a sensitive probe of the pion's internal dynamics, governing its mechanical radius -- the largest among the charge, mass, and mechanical radii. We further examine the pion's spatial structure via its associated two-dimensional light-front densities, including the momentum density, transverse pressure, and shear stress, all of which satisfy the required normalization and von Laue stability conditions. Our results reveal a detailed mechanical landscape: a centrally peaked momentum density that decreases monotonically; a repulsive pressure near the center (up to $x_\perp = 0.33$~fm) that transitions to attraction in the outer region; and a shear stress profile peaking at an intermediate distance ($x_\perp \approx 0.2$~fm).</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quark-Loop Contribution to Pure Annihilation Nonleptonic B-meson decays in PQCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct an enhanced investigation of pure annihilation-type charmless hadronic B-decays within the framework of the PQCD approach. Specifically, we account for the quark-loop enhanced contribution to various decay processes at the next-to-leading order(NLO) in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. The NLO amplitudes possess large imaginary parts that have signs opposite to those of the leading-order amplitudes. This cancellation effect implies that the NLO contribution does not significantly influence the branching ratios of the processes under consideration. However, the NLO effect explored in this work constitutes an important source of the strong phases in the weak - annihilation non-leptonic $\bar B_q$-meson decay amplitudes. As a result, it can have a substantial impact on CP - violating observables such as the direct CP asymmetry ${\cal A}_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}$ and mixing induced CP asymmetry ${\cal A}_{\rm CP}^{\rm mix}$. The numerical result evidently revealed that NLO QCD correction significantly enhances both ${\cal A}_{\rm CP}^{\rm dir}$ and ${\cal A}_{\rm CP}^{\rm mix}$ of the pure annihilation type B decay processes.</description>

      <title>New horizon in particle physics: First observation of CP violation in baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the LHCb Collaboration achieved the observation of CP violation (CPV) in baryon decays through the process of $\Lambda_b^0\to pK^-\pi^+\pi^-$, reporting an asymmetry of $(2.45\pm0.46\pm0.10)\%$ with a significance of 5.2$\sigma$. This marks a breakthrough and a milestone in particle physics, six decades after the first observation of CPV in mesons. It will be helpful to understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In addition to the global CPV, local CPV is also observed by LHCb in the low mass region of $m_{p\pi^+\pi^-}&lt;2.7$GeV as $(5.4\pm0.9\pm0.1)\%$ with a significance of 6.0$\sigma$. Intriguingly, this measurement aligns well with a theoretical prediction of $(5.6-5.9)\%$ based on a CPV dynamics using the data of $N\pi\to p\pi^+\pi^-$ scatterings. Since baryons contain one more quark than mesons, the dynamics of baryon decays are significantly different from those of mesons. Therefore, the first observation of baryon CPV by LHCb opens a new horizon in the studies of dynamics of the strong interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the $\bar{B}_{s}\to D_{sJ}$ transitions in covariant light-front approach, where $D_{sJ}$ denotes an s-wave or p-wave $c\bar{s}$ meson state. We first obtain the transition form factors within the framework of the quark model, and then apply the obtained form factors to obtain the branching fractions of semileptonic and nonleptonic decays. We also compare our results with experimental data and other theoretical predictions. We find that some branching fractions are sizable and might be accessible at the LHC and future $e^{+}$-$e^{-}$ colliders. Our work is expected to be of great value for establishing corresponding decay channels, and also be helpful in understanding the non-perturbative QCD dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological consequences of choosing a minimal set of effective operators that allow for the simultaneous generation of the dark matter relic density and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. Neutrino masses are obtained in a specific case of baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We find that only two new particles -- a heavy unstable fermion and a light dark matter scalar -- need to be included in addition to the Standard Model particle content.</description>

      <title>Superheavy dark matter from the natural inflation in light of the highest-energy astroparticle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superheavy dark matter has been attractive as a candidate of particle dark matter. We propose a "natural" particle model, in which the dark matter serves as the inflaton in natural inflation, while decaying to high-energy particles at energies of $10^{9}-10^{13} \, \text{GeV}$ from the prediction of the inflation. A scalar field responsible to dilute the dark matter abundance revives the natural inflation. Since the dark matter must be a spin zero scalar, we study carefully the galactic dark matter 3-body decay into fermions and two body decays into a gluon pair, and point out relevant multi-messenger bounds that constrain these decay modes. Interestingly, the predicted energy scale may coincide with the AMATERASU event and/or the KM3NeT neutrino event, KM3-230213A. We also point out particle models with dark baryon to further alleviate $\gamma$-ray bounds. This scenario yields several testable predictions for the UHECR observations, including the highest-energy neutrons that are unaffected by magnetic fields, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of spectral indices, $\alpha_s\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(0.001)$, and the existence of light new colored particles that could be accessible at future collider experiments. Further measurements of high energy cosmic rays, including their components and detailed coordinates may provide insight into not only the origin of the cosmic rays but also inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the dynamical core-corona initialization (DCCI2) model to include the baryon number evolution in the entire system created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Introducing the source term for the baryon number, we describe the early-stage equilibration and later-stage hydrodynamic evolution of the baryon number throughout the system from midrapidity to forward rapidity. Through numerical simulations with this extended model, we show that extremely large baryon chemical potentials are realized in forward rapidity regions at the LHC energy and are comparable to those of the BES energies. Moreover, we show that fluctuations of baryon chemical potentials are large and, consequently, negative baryon chemical potential regions appear at midrapidity.</description>

      <title>Evolution of self-gravitating spherical dark-matter halos with and without new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient numerical algorithm for evolving self-gravitating systems of dark-matter particles that leverages the assumption of spherical symmetry to reduce the nominally six-dimensional phase space to three dimensions. It can be used to quickly determine numerically the evolution of an initially static stable self-consistent self-gravitating system if there is some additional or new physics. We illustrate here with four examples: (1) the effects of the growth of a supermassive black hole at the center; (2) the effects of stripping of the outer layers of the halo (a toy model for the effects of tidal stripping of galaxies); (3) the response of a self-gravitating system to dark matter that decays to a slightly less massive state; and (4) the effects of a slow change to Newton's constant. The approach can be extended to study dark matter with elastic and inelastic self-interactions and to study the process of virialization in spherical collapse. We describe some aspects of a code NSphere that implements this approach which we are making available.</description>

      <title>Perturbative analysis of the reheating dynamics of $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.</description>

      <title>Examining Lorentz invariance violation with three remarkable GRB photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation in photons can be quantified by measuring the difference in arrival times between high- and low-energy photons originating from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). When analyzing data, it is crucial to consider the inherent time delay in the emission of these photons at the source of the GRB. In a recent study, three distinct models were evaluated to explain the intrinsic emission times of high-energy photons by analyzing 14 multi-GeV photon events detected from 8 GRBs using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST). In this study, we examine three remarkable GRB photons recorded by different observatories: the 99.3~GeV photon from GRB 221009A observed by FGST, the 1.07~TeV photon from GRB 190114C detected by the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope, and the 12.2~TeV photon from GRB 221009A observed by the Large High Altitude Air-shower Observatory (LHAASO). Our analysis indicates that the newly proposed model with a linear relationship between photon energy and intrinsic emission time can offer a consistent framework to explain the behavior of all three exceptional photons with a Lorentz violation scale $E_{\rm LV}\sim 3\times 10^{17}$~GeV.</description>

      <title>Correlations and fluctuations in a magnetized three-flavor PNJL model with and without inverse magnetic catalysis effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14532</link>

Abstract: The correlations $\chi^{BQ}_{11},\ \chi^{BS}_{11} ,\ \chi^{QS}_{11}$ and quadratic (quartic) fluctuations $\chi^{B,\ Q,\ S}_{2,4}$ of baryon number $B$, electric charge $Q$ and strangeness $S$ are investigated in a three-flavor PNJL model at finite temperature and magnetic field. The inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect is introduced through the magnetic field dependent parameters $G(eB)$ or $T_0(eB)$, and we make comparison of the results in the cases with and without IMC effect. Since including IMC effect does not change the strength of phase transition under external magnetic field, it does not lead to qualitative difference in the correlations and fluctuations, but modifies their values. Under vanishing and nonvanishing magnetic field, the correlations and fluctuations increase with temperature, and then show the peak around the pseudocritical temperatures of chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions. The peak structure in $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$, $\chi^B_{4}$ and $\chi^Q_{4}$ are much more apparent than in others. The correlations and fluctuations along the phase transition line under external magnetic field are characterized by the scaled correlations ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{XY}=\frac{\chi_{11}^{XY}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_{11}^{XY}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ and scaled quadratic (quartic) fluctuations ${\hat {\chi}}_{2,4}^{X}=\frac{\chi_{2,4}^{X}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_{2,4}^{X}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$, with $X,\ Y=B,\ Q,\ S$ and $X \neq Y$ at the pseudocritical temperature $T_{pc}^c$ of chiral restoration phase transition. They increase with magnetic fields due to the increase of phase transition strength under magnetic fields. Among them, ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ}$ increases fastest, which may serve as the magnetometer of QCD.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory of Quasiparticles, Retarded Correlators and Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic theory provides a powerful framework for investigating macroscopic and microscopic properties of weakly and strongly interacting plasmas. By assuming a constant mass profile within the kinetic theory approach, we examine the collective behavior of a system of massive relativistic particles within the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution. We derive the two-point retarded correlation functions for both charge and energy-momentum tensor components at arbitrary momentum and frequency values. To obtain analytical results, we expand relations for very small and large mass-to-temperature ratios ($m/T$). For large ratios, no significant effects are observed in the charge, shear, or sound propagation channels. However, for small ratios in the charge correlation function within the hydrodynamic limit, the mass tends to shift the hydrodynamic poles toward the unstable region, i.e., $\text{Im}(\omega) \geq 0$. This instability emerges at a critical value of $(m/T)_c \simeq 1.234$. Furthermore, in the sound channel, the mass amplifies the standard propagating sound mode, converting it into a purely (positive) imaginary mode. Consequently, all modes in this channel become purely imaginary, with instability becoming a dominant characteristic. In contrast, in the shear channel, all modes converge to their massless limits. Similar to the massless case, a threshold value exists for $(k \tau)$, below which the correlators exhibit solutions. We find that hydrodynamic poles arise in the strong coupling regime, while the weak coupling regime features a logarithmic branch cut between $\omega = k$ and $\omega = -k$ that is analogous to the massless scenario. Additionally, we derive the shear and bulk viscosity transport coefficients, along with other coefficients up to third order in gradients, as an expansion in terms of small $(m/T)$.</description>

      <title>The quest for the quark-gluon plasma from the perspective of dynamical models of relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>

Abstract: The physics of heavy-ion collisions is one of the most exciting and challenging directions of science for the last four decades. On the theoretical side one deals with a non-abelian field theory, while on the experimental side today's largest accelerators are needed to enable these studies. The discovery of a new stage of matter - called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) - and the study of its properties is one of the major achievements of modern physics. In this contribution we briefly review the history of theoretical descriptions of heavy-ion collisions based on dynamical models, focusing on the personal experiences in this inspiring field.</description>

      <title>Configuration Requirements for 21-cm Forest Background Quasar Searches with the Moon-based Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest offers a powerful cosmological probe of the thermal history and small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Its success, however, critically depends on the availability of high-redshift radio-loud quasars (HzRLQs) as background sources. In this work, we investigate the configuration requirements for a Moon-based low-frequency radio interferometer aimed at maximizing the detection of HzRLQs for future 21-cm forest studies. Building upon a previously developed quasar luminosity function (QLF), we forecast HzRLQ abundances under various array configurations. Assuming a total survey area of $10^4\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ and 1 year of observation, we compare continuum surveys with 10 MHz bandwidth and 21-cm forest surveys with 5 kHz resolution. Our results show that a minimum collecting area of $\sim$6 500 m$^2$ enables detection at $z \sim 6$, while SKA-like arrays ($N_{\mathrm{st}} = 512$) extend the detection limit to $z \sim 10$ for 21-cm forest survey and $z \sim 16$ for continuum survey. Larger arrays with $N_{\mathrm{st}} = 2048$ can reach $z \sim 11$ in 21-cm forest mode. We also explore configurations that maintain fixed collecting areas while increasing the number to enhance survey efficiency. This boosts source detection but significantly increases the data volume and computational demands. These results underscore the importance of optimizing array design for different survey goals and balancing sensitivity, spectral resolution, and data management. A well-designed Moon-based array could open a new observational window on reionization and early cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>Wigner multiplets in QFT: from Wigner degeneracy to Elko fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the theoretical foundation of the Wigner superposition field, a quantum field framework for spin-1/2 fermions that exhibit a Wigner doublet -- a discrete quantum number arising from nontrivial representations of the extended Poincar\'{e} group. In contrast to the previously developed doublet formalism, which treats the Wigner degeneracy as a superficial label, the superposition formalism encodes it directly into the structure of a unified field via a coherent superposition of degenerate spinor fields. By imposing the Lorentz covariance, causality, and canonical quantization, we derive nontrivial constraints on the field configuration, which uniquely identify the Elko field as the consistent realization of the Wigner superposition field. Our analysis further clarifies that although the Elko field is a spinor field, it possesses mass dimension one and obeys the Klein-Gordon rather than the Dirac kinematics. Moreover, we explore the general Elko representation through basis redefinitions, showing that certain traditional properties, such as being eigenspinors of charge conjugation, are artifacts of specific basis choices rather than intrinsic features. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of Elko as a dark matter (DM) candidate. This work lays the foundation for a systematic reformulation of Elko interactions and its phenomenology as a viable component of DM.</description>

      <title>FRB cosmology with the RM-PRS Luminosity Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological studies, particularly through the dispersion measure-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$) relation. This work proposes a novel calibration method for FRBs using the Yang-Li-Zhang (YLZ) empirical relation, which links the rotation measure (RM) of FRBs to the luminosity of their associated persistent radio sources (PRS). We demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on cosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional $\mathrm{DM}-z$ method. Utilizing the current sample of four YLZ-calibrated FRBs, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_0 = 86.18_{-14.99}^{+18.03}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ (68\% CL). Monte Carlo simulations indicate that a future catalog of 400 FRB-PSR systems could reduce the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 4.5\%. Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with $\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized samples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 2.9\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially mitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass fraction ($f_{\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Hydrodynamics in Hadronic Phase of Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

Abstract: The hadronic phase and its dynamics in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are topics of immense discussion. The hadronic phase contains various massive hadrons with an abundance of the lightest hadron, i.e., $\pi$-mesons (pions). In this paper, we consider that pions are in thermal equilibrium in the hadronic phase and use second-order viscous hydrodynamics for a medium of massive pions to obtain its expansion to the boundary of the kinetic freeze-out. We achieve the kinetic freeze-out boundary with the Knudsen number $Kn&gt;1$ limit. When this condition is met, hydrodynamics expansion breaks down, and the mean free path becomes sufficiently large in comparison with the system size so that the particle yields are preserved. Further, we investigate the effect of the massive fluid on the resonance particle yields, including re-scattering and regeneration, along with the natural decay widths of the resonances. The resonances can play an essential role in determining the characteristics of the hadronic phase as they have sufficiently small lifetimes, which may be comparable to the hadronic phase lifetime. In the current study, we predict the hadronic phase lifetime, which is further used to determine the $K^*(892)^0/K$, $\phi(1020)/K$, and $\rho(770)^0/\pi$ yield ratios at the kinetic freeze-out. We calculate these ratios as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum and compare the findings with experimental data. Our calculations qualitatively agree with the experimental data, indicating a possible hydrodynamical evolution of the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of a polarized neutron by internal weak nuclear forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proven that a polarized neutron gets accelerated by internal nuclear forces along the coherent rotation of its spin. The net force upon the neutron arises from the weak nuclear interactions between its quarks. It is the result of the simultaneous breaking of parity symmetry by the chiral interactions between the neutron's quarks, and of time-reversal symmetry along the inversion of their spins. The variation of the neutron's kinetic momentum is accompanied with the transfer of an equivalent momentum to the fields of the Z and W bosons that mediate the interactions, in the opposite direction. The effect is linear in Fermi's constant. Using the simplest hadron models, an upper bound of the order of meters per second is estimated for the velocity variation of the polarized neutron along the spin-flip process.</description>

      <title>Study of transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the charge and the heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation using a novel approximation method. Following the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model, we have proposed a novel Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model with a modified collision integral to carry out the aforementioned study. We have also compared our findings with the results of the novel RTA, the standard RTA and the standard BGK models. Our observation shows that the novel collision integrals for both the RTA and BGK models decrease the charge and the heat transport phenomena in the medium, as evidenced by the reduced values of the transport coefficients, such as the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, when compared to the standard RTA and standard BGK models. Furthermore, certain observables, such as the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number have been explored using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models. We have found an overall decreasing trend of the thermal diffusion constant with the temperature in the novel BGK model, similar to the novel RTA model, but the magnitude remains higher throughout the temperature range. However, the magnitude of the thermal diffusion constant in the proposed novel BGK model remains lower than its value in the standard BGK model. The magnitude of the Lorenz number in the novel BGK model remains higher than that in the standard BGK model, but it is lower than that in the novel RTA model. We have also observed that the Lorenz number in all cases has an increasing trend at low temperatures, showing a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, whereas at high temperatures, it becomes saturated. The Lorenz number remaining above unity indicates that the thermal conductivity prevails over the electrical conductivity in the aforesaid models.</description>

Abstract: Faithful energy reconstruction is foundational for precision neutrino experiments like DUNE, but is hindered by uncertainties in our understanding of neutrino--nucleus interactions. Here, we demonstrate that dense neural networks are very effective in overcoming these uncertainties by estimating inaccessible kinematic variables based on the observable part of the final state. We find improvements in the energy resolution by up to a factor of two compared to conventional reconstruction algorithms, which translates into an improved physics performance equivalent to a 10-30% increase in the exposure.</description>

      <title>Nuclear deformation effects in photoproduction of $\rho$ mesons in ultraperipheral isobaric collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the $\rho^{0}$ meson photoproduction in ultraperipheral isobaric collisions between $_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}+_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}$ and $_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}+_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, employing the dipole model with the equivalent photon approximation. By implementing the Woods-Saxon distribution to represent the nuclear mass density, which is derived from density functional theory with an inclusion of nuclear deformation effects, we have calculated the transverse momentum $q_{T}$ spectra in isobaric collisions. We observe the characteristic dip behavior in these spectra, indicative of diffraction phenomena in high-energy physics. We notice that the deformation effects cause a nearly linear increase with $q_{T}^{2}$ for $q_{T}^{2}\lesssim0.015$ $\textrm{GeV}^{2}$, aligning with experimental observations. We offer a simple explanation for the observed behavior in these spectra by introducing the effective width of the nuclei in the thickness function. We also extend our discussion on the $\rho^{0}$ meson photoproduction with the targets $^{63}\textrm{Cu}$,$^{197}\textrm{Au}$, and $^{238}\textrm{U}$.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Hydrodynamization and the Emergence of Attractors: a Unified Description of Hydrodynamization in Kinetic Theory</title>

Abstract: "Attractor" solutions for the pre-hydrodynamic, far-from-equilibrium, evolution of the matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions have emerged as crucial descriptors of the rapid hydrodynamization of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Adiabatic Hydrodynamization (AH) has been proposed as a framework with which to describe, explain, and predict attractor behavior that draws upon an analogy to the adiabatic approximation in quantum mechanics. In this work, we systematize the description of pre-hydrodynamic attractors in kinetic theory by showing how to use the AH framework to identify these long-lived solutions to which varied initial conditions rapidly evolve, demonstrating the robustness of this framework. In a simplified QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle scattering limit, we use AH to explain both the early- and late-time scaling behavior of a longitudinally expanding gluon gas in a unified framework. In this context, we show that AH provides a unified description of, and intuition for, all the stages of what in QCD would be bottom-up thermalization, starting from a pre-hydrodynamic attractor and ending with hydrodynamization. We additionally discuss the connection between the notions of scaling behavior and adiabaticity and the crucial role of time-dependent coordinate redefinitions in identifying the degrees of freedom of kinetic theories that give rise to attractor solutions. The tools we present open a path to the intuitive explanation of how attractor behavior arises and how the attractor evolves in all stages of the hydrodynamization of QGP in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Predictions and Tests for Semi-leptonic Decays of Beauty Hadrons,</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make predictions and propose tests for the semi-leptonic decays $B\to D^{(*)} l \bar{\nu}_l$ and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda_c l \bar{\nu}_l$, with $l$ = $e$, $\mu$ and $\tau$. Preliminarily, we study such processes according to the $\ell-s$ scheme, which helps interpreting the results of previous analyses. Then, we write the angular distributions of those decays in the helicity formalism and suggest for each decay some tests for distinguishing among the various Dirac operators which may explain the tensions with the standard model. In particular, we propose, for $l$ = $e$ and $\mu$, to study the fully differential distribution. In the cases of the $B\to D^*$ and $\Lambda_b$ decays, important physical information can be extracted even after integrating over the momentum of the charged lepton, which is quite suitable for $l$ = $\tau$. Especially, the decay angular distribution of polarized $\Lambda_b$ depends on five observables, which assume different values according to the various new-physics interactions; one of these observables is related to the longitudinal polarization of the $\tau-\bar{\nu}_\tau$ system, which can be compared with the $D^*$ longitudinal polarization in the $B\to D^*$ decay. Moreover, we analyze the $\tau$ anomaly in the branching ratios of the semi-leptonic decays; to this end, we make some assumptions, which have a remarkable predictive power and lead to results in agreement with previous theoretical calculations. Thanks to these assumptions, we combine our present analysis of the $\Lambda_b$ decay with the previous ones of the $B\to D^{(*)}$ decays, getting strong constraints on the parameters which characterize the different new-physics operators and an indication on the most likely one.</description>

      <title>Understanding the non-trivial isoscalar pseudoscalar structures in the $K_S K_S\pi^0$ spectra in the $J/\psi$ radiative decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Initiated by the recent observation of a flattened lineshape of $IJ^{PC}=00^{-+}$ around $1.4\sim 1.5$ GeV in the $K_S K_S \pi^0$ invariant mass spectrum by BESIII, we make a systematic partial wave analysis of $J/\psi \to\gamma\eta_X\to \gamma K\bar{K}\pi$ based on an isobaric approach. We demonstrate that in the scenario of the first radial excitations of the isoscalar pseudoscalar from the $K\bar{K}\pi$ threshold to about 1.6 GeV the non-trivial $K_S K_S \pi^0$ invariant mass spectrum can be explained by the coupled-channel effects with the presence of the triangle singularity mechanism.
  It shows that a combined fit of the Dalitz plots, three-body and two-body spectra can be achieved which suggests that the one-state solution around $1.4\sim 1.5$ GeV proposed before still holds well. In particular, we show that the coupled-channel effects between the three important quasi-two-body decay channels, $K^*\bar{K}+c.c.$, $\kappa \bar{K}+c.c.$ and $a_0(980)\pi$, can be well described by taking into account the one-loop corrections in the isobaric approach.
  This is because the isoscalar pseudoscalar states are coupled to the $K^*\bar{K}+c.c.$ and $a_0(980)\pi$ ($\kappa \bar{K}+c.c.$) channels via the $P$ and $S$ waves, respectively. As a consequence, the coupled-channel effects can be largely absorbed into the redefinition of the tree-level effective couplings with the transition amplitudes computed to the order of one-loop corrections. Then, the coupled-channel effects can be estimated by the contributions from the one-loop rescattering amplitudes in comparison with the tree-level ones, where we find that the rescattering contributions from the $P$-wave into the $S$-wave, or vice verse, are apparently suppressed in the kinematic region near threshold.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $\tau$-decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the determinations of the QCD condensates within the SVZ expansion in the axial-vector (A) channel using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) ${\cal R}_{10}^A(\tau)$ within stability criteria and $\tau$-like higher moments ${R}_{n,A}$ within stability for arbitrary $\tau$-mass squared $s_0$. We find the same violation of the factorization by a factor 6 of the four-quark condensate as from $e^+e^- \to$ Hadrons data. One can notice a systematic alternate sign and no exponential growth of the size of these condensates. Then, we extract $\alpha_s$ from the lowest $\tau$-decay like moment and find: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{V-A}=0.3135(83)$ (FO) and 0.3322 (81) (CI) leading to: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{V-A}=0.1177(10)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ (FO) and $0.1200(9)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$\,(CI). We extend the analysis to the V--A channel and find: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{V-A}=0.3135(83)$ (FO) and 0.3322 (81) (CI) leading to: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{V-A}=0.1177(10)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ (FO) and $0.1200(9)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$\,(CI). We observe that in different channels ($e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons, \, A,\,V-A), the extraction of $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ at the observed $\tau$-mass leads to an overestimate of its value. Our determinations from these different channels lead to the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3140(44)$ (FO) and 0.3346 (35) (CI) leading to: $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1178(6)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ (FO) and $0.1202(4)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$(CI). Comparisons with some other results are done.</description>

      <title>Large neutrino mass in cosmology and keV sterile neutrino dark matter from a dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extended seesaw model which generates active neutrino masses via the usual type-I seesaw and leads to a large number of massless fermions as well as a sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100) {\rm~keV}$ mass range. The dark sector comes into thermal equilibrium with Standard Model neutrinos after neutrino decoupling and before recombination via a U(1) gauge interaction in the dark sector. This suppresses the abundance of active neutrinos and therefore reconciles sizeable neutrino masses with cosmology. The DM abundance is determined by freeze-out in the dark sector, which allows avoiding bounds from X-ray searches. Our scenario predicts a slight increase in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ at recombination, potentially detectable by future CMB missions.</description>

      <title>Probing Gravitational Dark Matter with Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM) is compelling, yet its nature remains elusive. A minimal scenario involves DM interacting solely through gravity. However, the detection would be extremely challenging. In the early Universe, such DM can be unavoidably generated via annihilation of particles in the standard model (SM) thermal plasma. It is known that the SM thermal plasma also produces gravitational waves (GWs). In this study, we establish a simple connection between the amplitude of thermal GWs and the properties of pure gravitational DM. Notably, future GW experiments in the ultra-high frequency regime have the potential to shed light on the mass and spin of pure gravitational DM.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\mu}$-Hybrid Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings in $\mathbf{SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a scenario based on $\mu$-hybrid inflation within the framework of a left-right symmetric model defined by the gauge symmetry group $G_{3221} = SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$. This model features a two-stage symmetry breaking to the Standard Model, with inflation occurring between the two stages, resulting in the dilution of primordial monopoles produced during the symmetry breaking of $SU(2)_R$ to $U(1)_R$. The second symmetry breaking gives rise to a network of metastable cosmic strings, which produces gravitational waves that can be observed by current and future experiments. A crucial aspect of this model is the inclusion of $R$-symmetry breaking terms in the superpotential, which helps explain the origin of the first symmetry breaking scale and ensures experimentally viable inflation with a minimal (canonical) K\"ahler potential. We show that the model successfully implements consistent inflation, leptogenesis, metastable cosmic strings, and gravitino dark matter, all in agreement with the observational data and constraints on reheating temperature from leptogenesis and gravitino overproduction bounds. We explore the potential embedding of $G_{3221}$ within the gauge symmetry $G_{422} = SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$, and provide a brief discussion on the proton decay predictions, which can be tested by the upcoming experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate the chemical and kinetic nonequilibrium dynamics of the Higgs boson during the primordial Universe QGP (quark-gluon plasma) epoch $130\mathrm{\,GeV}&gt;T&gt;10\mathrm{\,GeV}$. We show that the Higgs bosons is always out of chemical abundance equilibrium with a fugacity $\Upsilon_h = 0.69$ due to virtual decay channels. Additionally, Higgs momentum distribution is found to be ``cold'' for $T&lt;25$\,GeV, since the scattering rate drops below the production rate.</description>

      <title>Is Dark Matter the origin of the $B\to K \nu\bar\nu$ excess at Belle II?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two models of dark matter (DM) that can provide a natural explanation of the excess of $B^+\to K^+ +\,\text{invisible}$ events with respect to the Standard Model (SM) prediction for $B^+\to K^+ \nu\bar\nu$, which has been reported by the Belle II collaboration. Interactions between the dark and the visible sector are mediated by an axion-like particle (ALP) in one case, by the kinetic mixing between a dark photon and the SM photon in the second case. Both models encompass a light fermion singlet as the DM candidate and can account for the observed DM relic abundance through, respectively, the freeze-in and the freeze-out production mechanism, while simultaneously explaining the Belle II excess.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Up until now the works regarding leptogenesis have discussed different mechanisms to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). The type-$II$ seesaw mechanism employing triplet scalars has been well studied in this context and the triplet vacuum expectation value (VEV) answering to the observed BAU is $(&lt; 10^{-2} ~ GeV)$. On the contrary we are invoking an extended Georgi-Machacek type scenario, capable of generating BAU through leptogenesis while keeping the triplet VEV at a moderate range where it plays a nontrivial role in electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). In this study we have also considered the decaying scalar mass responsible for leptogenesis to be within a TeV and hence one can probe this possibility at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) itself via different kinds of signature corresponding to different triplet VEV region.</description>

      <title>Event-by-event fluctuations of mean transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with PYTHIA8 and HERWIG7 models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimations of event-by-event mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$) fluctuations are reported in terms of the integral correlator, $\langle \Delta p_{\rm T} \Delta p_{\rm T}\rangle$, and the skewness of event-wise $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ distribution in proton$-$proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA8 and HERWIG7. The final-state charged particles with transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) ranges $0.15 \leq p_{\rm T}\leq 2.0$ GeV/$c$ and $|\eta| \leq 0.8$ were considered for the investigation. The correlator, $\langle \Delta p_{\rm T} \Delta p_{\rm T}\rangle$, is observed to follow distinct decreasing trends with average charged particle multiplicity ($\langle N_{\rm ch} \rangle$) for the models. Furthermore, both models yield positive finite skewness in low-multiplicity events. Fluctuations are additionally studied using the transverse spherocity estimator ($S_{\rm 0}$) to understand the relative contributions of hard scattering (jets) and other soft processes to the observed fluctuations. Comparing model predictions for $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ fluctuations provides valuable insight into the sensitivity of these fluctuations to hadronization and parton shower models. This is essential for a reliable interpretation of the fluctuation dynamics in pp collisions. Moreover, such comparisons would help to establish a crucial baseline for identifying and studying non-trivial fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter search from terrestrial magnetic fields at extremely low frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The natural environment of the Earth can act as a sensitive detector for dark matter in ultralight axions. When axions with masses between $1\times10^{-15}\,{\rm eV}$ and $1\times10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ pass through the Earth, they interact with the global geomagnetic field, generating electromagnetic (EM) waves in the extremely low-frequency range ($0.3$--$30\,{\rm Hz}$) through axion-photon coupling. This paper is one of a series of companion papers for~\cite{Taruya:2025zql}, focusing on the data analysis method and search results for an axion signal. Utilizing the theoretical predictions of axion-induced EM spectra from a companion study, we analyzed long-term observational data of terrestrial magnetic fields in this frequency band to search for axion-induced signals. Our analysis identified 65 persistent signal candidates with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3. Aside from these candidates, we placed a new upper bound on the axion-photon coupling parameter, significantly refining the previous constraint from CAST by at most two orders of magnitude down to $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 4\times10^{-13} \,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for the axion mass around $3 \times 10^{-14}\,{\rm eV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the doubly bottom $H_{(s)}\bar{T}_{(s)}$ and $H_{(s)}T_{(s)}$ systems by adopting the one-boson-exchange model, where $H_{(s)}$ and $T_{(s)}$ represent $S$-wave $B^{(*)}_{(s)}$ and $P$-wave $B^{(*)}_{(s)1,2}$ doublets, respectively. For the $H\bar{T}$ systems, we predict some loosely bound states in the $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{-\pm})$ $B\bar{B}_{1}$, $I(J^{PC})=0(2^{--})$ $B\bar{B}_{2}^{*}$, $I(J^{PC})=0(1^{-\pm})$ $B^*\bar{B}_{1}$ and $I(J^{PC})=0(2^{-\pm})$ $B^*\bar{B}_{2}^{*}$ channels, which are the most promising hidden bottom molecular tetraquarks. For the $HT$ systems, the $I(J^{P})=0(1^{-})$ $B^*B_1$ and $I(J^{P})=0(2^{-})$ $B^{*}B^{*}_2$ channels are also likely to form molecular tetraquarks. In contrast, no molecular candidates have been identified in the bottom-strange sectors. One can hope that our predictions will provide valuable insights to the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations as they continue to explore this fascinating field through experimental research.</description>

      <title>Fast neutrino flavor conversions in a supernova: Emergence, evolution, and effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast flavor conversions (FFCs) of neutrinos, which can occur in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), are multiangle effects. They depend on the angular distribution of the neutrino's electron lepton number (ELN). In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the FFCs by solving the multienergy and multiangle quantum kinetic equations with an extended set of collisional weak processes based on a static and spherically symmetric CCSN matter background profile. We investigate the emergence and evolution of FFCs in models featuring different ELN angular distributions, considering scenarios with two and three neutrino flavors. The spectrogram method is utilized to illustrate the small-scale spatial structure, and we show that this structure of neutrino flavor coherence and number densities in the nonlinear regime is qualitatively consistent with the dispersion relation analysis. On the coarse-grained level, we find that different asymptotic states can be achieved following the FFCs depending on the locations and shapes of the ELN distributions, despite sharing a common feature of the elimination of the ELN angular crossing. While equilibration among different neutrino flavors may be achieved immediately after the prompt FFCs, it is not a general outcome of the asymptotic state, as subsequent feedback effects from collisional neutrino-matter interactions come into play, particularly for cases where FFCs occur inside the neutrinosphere. The impacts of FFCs and the feedback effect on the net neutrino heating rates, the equilibrium electron fraction of CCSN matter, and the free-streaming neutrino energy spectra are quantitatively assessed. Other aspects including the impact of the vacuum term and the coexistence with other type of flavor instabilities are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of in~situ stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define in~situ stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinise correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unravelling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Shaping Dark Photon Spectral Distortions</title>

Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is an extraordinary tool for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. The exquisite precision of the measurement makes it particularly sensitive to small effects caused by hidden sector interactions. In particular, CMB spectral distortions can unveil the existence of dark photons which are kinetically coupled to the standard photon. In this work, we use the COBE-FIRAS dataset to derive accurate and robust limits on photon-to-dark-photon oscillations for a large range of dark photon masses, from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-4}$ eV. We consider in detail the redshift dependence of the bounds, computing CMB distortions due to photon injection/removal using a Green's function method. Our treatment improves on previous results, which had set limits studying energy injection/removal into baryons rather than photon injection/removal, or ignored the redshift evolution of distortions. The difference between our treatment and previous ones is particularly noticeable in the predicted spectral shape of the distortions, a smoking gun signature for photon-to-dark-photon oscillations. The characterization of the spectral shape is crucial for future CMB missions, which could improve the present sensitivity by orders of magnitude, exploring regions of the dark photon parameter space that are otherwise difficult to access.</description>

      <title>Hadronic decay of vector charmonium from the lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating decay parameters in lattice simulations is a computationally demanding problem, requiring several volumes and momenta. We explore an alternative approach, where the transition amplitude can be extracted from the spectral decomposition of particular ratios built from correlation functions. This so-called ratio method has the advantage of not needing various irreducible representations or volumes, and it allows us to predict the decay width $\Gamma$ and the energy shift $\epsilon$ of the spectrum directly. In this work, we apply this method to study the hadronic decay $\psi(3770)\to \bar{D}D$ on two CLS $N_\text{f}=2$ ensembles. This approach requires close to on-shell kinematics to work, and we employ twisted boundary conditions to precisely tune the on-shell point. Although our study is yet to approach the continuum limit, we find a value of $\Gamma$ fully compatible to the physical result, and $\epsilon$ informs us by how much our spectrum would shift in a fully dynamical simulation. Besides lattice calculations, many analytical tools have been proposed to understand decay processes. A relatively simple, early example is the ${}^3P_0$ quark model, which provides a physical insight of the decay process.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators at the Loop Level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode rich information about physics at the Hubble scale and may exhibit characteristic oscillatory signals due to the exchange of massive particles. Although many 1-loop processes, especially those that break de Sitter (dS) boosts, can generate significant leading signals for various particle models in cosmological collider physics, the precise results for these correlators or their full signals remain unknown due to the lack of symmetry. In this work, we apply the method of partial Mellin-Barnes (PMB) representation to the calculation of cosmological correlators at the loop level. As a first step, we use the PMB representation to calculate four-point cosmological correlators with bubble topology. We find that both the nonlocal and local signals arise from the factorized part, validating the cutting rules proposed in previous work, and are free from UV divergence. Furthermore, the UV divergence originates solely from the background piece and can be manifestly canceled by introducing the appropriate counterterm, similar to the procedure in flat spacetime. We also demonstrate how to renormalize the 1-loop correlators in Mellin space. After a consistency check with known results for the covariant case, we provide new analytical results for the signals generated from a nontrivial dS-boost-breaking bubble.</description>

      <title>Two Micron-Size Dark Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two extra dimensions of micron scale might simultaneously address the gauge and cosmological hierarchy problems. In our paper we examine various observational bounds in scenarios with one and two large extra dimensions, to see if they are compatible with the micron scale. We show that consistency with astrophysical observations requires that two extra dimensions of micron scale must not admit isometries, whereby conservation of the extra dimensional momentum is violated, allowing the massive Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton to decay to other lighter graviton modes. However, to remain consistent with cosmological observations two extra dimensions of micron scale require a delicately fine tuning of the temperature at which the universe enters the radiation dominated epoch. Diving into this fine-tuned scenario we also show that primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^8 &lt;M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} &lt;10^{21}$ could make all cosmological dark matter.</description>

      <title>Core-collapse supernova explosions hindered by eV-mass sterile neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light sterile neutrinos, $\nu_s$, are often introduced to explain an anomalous deficit in the electron antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. If they exist, sterile neutrinos would also be produced in collapsing massive stars through the active-sterile neutrino oscillation. In order to investigate the impacts of sterile neutrinos on supernova dynamics, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core-collapse coupled with the active-sterile oscillation through the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect. As the initial condition of our simulations, we adopt a blue supergiant model that is tuned to reproduce observational features of the SN 1987A progenitor to compare our models with observations of the event. It is found that the active-sterile oscillation reduces the $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes and decreases the explosion energy. We also find that, if the mixing angle $\theta$ and the mass difference $\delta m_\mathrm{s}^2$ between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_s$ are large enough, the star fails to explode. This suggests that these mixing parameters relevant to sterile neutrinos could be constrained by supernova explodability, though other uncertainties in supernova theory need to be addressed to refine them. In addition, we predict neutrino signals from a nearby supernova event and find that the neutrino event number can significantly decrease because the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes are reduced. In particular, DUNE observations of $\nu_e$ will be useful to search for a signature of sterile neutrinos with a tiny mixing angle because a smaller mixing angle leads to a larger effect on the $\nu_e$ flux.</description>

      <title>How much has DESI dark energy evolved since DR1?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DESI has reported a dynamical dark energy (DE) signal based on the $w_0 w_a$CDM model that is in conflict with Hubble tension. Recalling that the combination of DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in \cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent outlier, a distinction now held jointly with ELG1, LRG2 switches from smaller to larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or ELG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has the greatest bearing on $w_0 &gt; -1$. We conclude that BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.</description>

      <title>First law of de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter state has a special symmetry: it is homogeneous, and its curvature is constant in space. Since all the points in the de Sitter space are equivalent, this state is described by local thermodynamics. This state has the local temperature $T=H/\pi$ (which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature), the local entropy density, the local energy density, and also the local gravitational degrees of freedom -- the scalar curvature ${\cal R}$ and the effective gravitational coupling $K$. On the other hand, there is the cosmological horizon, which can be also characterized by the thermodynamic relations. We consider the connections between the local thermodynamics and the thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. In particular, there is the holographic connection between the entropy density integrated over the Hubble volume and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the horizon, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=A/4G$. We also consider the first law of thermodynamics in these two approaches. In the local thermodynamics, on the one hand, the first law is valid for an arbitrary volume $V$ of de Sitter space. On the other hand, the first law is also applicable to the thermodynamics of the horizon. In both cases, the temperature is the same. This consideration is extended to the contracting de Sitter with its negative entropy, $S_{\rm volume}=S_{\rm horizon}=-A/4G$.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions in the Schwinger model from Tensor Network States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - "Schwinger atoms" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.</description>
