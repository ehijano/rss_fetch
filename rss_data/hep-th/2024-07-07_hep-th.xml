      <title>All-loop group-theory constraints for four-point amplitudes of SU($N$), SO($N$), and Sp($N$) gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the decomposition of gauge-theory amplitudes into kinematic and color factors, the color factors (at a given loop order $L$) span a proper subspace of the extended trace space (which consists of single and multiple traces of generators of the gauge group, graded by powers of $N$). Using an iterative process, we systematically construct the $L$-loop color space of four-point amplitudes of fields in the adjoint representation of SU($N$), SO($N$), or Sp($N$). We define the null space as the orthogonal complement of the color space. For SU($N$), we confirm the existence of four independent null vectors (for $L \ge 2$) and for SO($N$) and Sp($N$), we establish the existence of seventeen independent null vectors (for $L \ge 5$). Each null vector corresponds to a group-theory constraint on the color-ordered amplitudes of the gauge theory.</description>

      <title>From Inflation to Quintessence: a History of the Universe in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a type IIB 4D string model with stabilised moduli which is able to describe the history of the universe from inflation to quintessence. The underlying Calabi-Yau volume is controlled by two moduli which are stabilised by perturbative effects. The lighter of them drives Fibre Inflation at a large energy scale. The two associated axions are ultra-light since they are lifted only at the non-perturbative level. The lighter of them can drive quintessence if its decay constant is large enough to prevent quantum diffusion during inflation from ruining the initial conditions. The right dark energy scale can be obtained via a large suppression from poly-instanton effects. The heavier axion gives a negligible contribution to dark matter since it starts oscillating after matter-radiation equality. If instead none of the two axions has a large decay constant, a mild alignment allows the lighter axion to drive quintessence, while the heavier can be at most a few percent of dark matter due to isocurvature and UV bounds. In both cases dark matter can also come from either primordial black holes or the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum black holes: a primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review constructions of three-dimensional `quantum' black holes. Such spacetimes arise via holographic braneworlds and are exact solutions to an induced higher-derivative theory of gravity consistently coupled to a large$-c$ quantum field theory with an ultraviolet cutoff, accounting for all orders of semi-classical backreaction. Notably, such quantum-corrected black holes are much larger than the Planck length. We describe the geometry and horizon thermodynamics of a host of asymptotically (anti-) de Sitter and flat quantum black holes. A summary of higher-dimensional extensions is given. We survey multiple applications of quantum black holes and braneworld holography.</description>

      <title>Global aspects of $3$-form gauge theory: implications for axion-Yang-Mills systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the proposition that axion-Yang-Mills systems are characterized by a $3$-form gauge theory in the deep infrared regime. This hypothesis is rigorously examined by initially developing a systematic framework for analyzing $3$-form gauge theory coupled to an axion, specifically focusing on its global properties. The theory consists of a BF term deformed by marginal and irrelevant operators and describes a network of vacua separated by domain walls converging at the junction of an axion string. It encompasses $(-1)$-, $0$-, and $3$-form spontaneously broken global symmetries. Utilizing this framework, in conjunction with effective field theory techniques and 't Hooft anomaly-matching conditions, we argue that the $3$-form gauge theory faithfully captures the infrared physics of the axion-Yang-Mills system. The ultraviolet theory is an $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory endowed with a massless Dirac fermion coupled to a complex scalar and is characterized by chiral and genuine $\mathbb{Z}_m^{(1)}$ 1-form center symmetries, with a mixed anomaly between them. It features two scales: the vev of the complex scalar, $v$, and the strong-coupling scale, $\Lambda$, with $\Lambda \ll v$. Below $v$, the fermion decouples and two symmetries emerge: $U(1)^{(2)}$ $2$-form winding and $\mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ $1$-form center symmetries. As we flow below $\Lambda$, matching the mixed anomaly necessitates introducing a dynamical $3$-form gauge field of $U(1)^{(2)}$, which appears as the incarnation of a long-range tail of the color field. The infrared theory possesses spontaneously broken chiral, emergent $3$-form, and emergent $(-1)$-form global symmetries. It passes several checks, among which: it displays the expected restructuring in the hadronic sector upon transition between the vacua, and it is consistent under the gauging of the genuine $\mathbb Z_m^{(1)}\subset \mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>The effects of SUSY on the emergent spacetime in the Lorentzian type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lorentzian type IIB matrix model is a promising candidate for a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. Recently we performed complex Langevin simulations by adding a Lorentz invariant mass term as an IR regulator and found a (1+1)-dimensional expanding spacetime with a Lorentzian signature emerging dynamically at late times when the fermionic contribution is omitted. Here we find that this is merely an artifact of the Lorentz boosts by showing that the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry is eliminated if one chooses a Lorentz frame appropriately. On the other hand, when we include the fermionic contribution, we find some evidence suggesting the emergence of a smooth (3+1)-dimensional expanding Lorentzian spacetime.</description>

      <title>Integrated correlators in a $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory with fundamental flavors: a matrix-model perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The D theory is a $\mathcal{N}=2$ conformal SYM theory in four dimensions with gauge group SU($N$), four matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental and two in the anti-symmetric representation, and a flavor symmetry that contains a U(4) factor. Its holographic dual is obtained via a combination of orbifold and orientifold projections from Type II B string theory on $\mathrm{AdS}_5 \times S^5$ and possesses a sector of open strings attached to D7 branes with U(4) Chan-Paton factors. The AdS Veneziano amplitude of the U(4) gluons is dual to four-point correlators of moment-map operators of the U(4) flavor symmetry in the D theory. An integrated version of these correlators is captured by a deformation of the D theory in which the fundamental hypermultiplets acquire a mass. The partition function of this massive theory can be evaluated with matrix-model techniques using localization. In this paper we analyze the matrix model of the mass-deformed D theory arising from localization using the so-called ``full Lie algebra'' approach in a $1/N$ expansion. In particular, we study the partition function and its mass derivatives up to $O(1/N^2)$ corrections obtaining exact expressions that are valid for all values of the 't Hooft coupling. We also analyze their behavior at strong coupling where our results produce useful constraints on the dual open string scattering amplitudes in AdS.</description>

Abstract: Canonical differential equations matrix is the 1-$\mathrm{d}\log$-form coefficients of projecting ($n$+1)-$\mathrm{d}\log$-forms onto $n$-$\mathrm{d}\log$-forms master integrand. Intersection number with dual form in relative cohomology could achieve the projecting and give selection rules of canonical differential equations from the pole structure of $\mathrm{d}\log$ master integrand.</description>

      <title>Generalized $T\overline{T}$-like Deformations in Duality-Invariant Nonlinear Electrodynamic Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a high-order perturbation methodology to categorize two primary solution types within duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamic theories, adhering to the differential self-duality criterion. The first solution type aligns with irrelevant stress tensor flows, resembling $T\bar{T}$ dynamics, and the second involves a blend of irrelevant $T\bar{T}$-like and marginal root-$T\bar{T}$-like deformations. Our approach facilitates the investigation of diverse duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics theories and their stress tensor flows and confirms the commutativity of flows initiated by irrelevant and marginal operators.</description>

      <title>A distance conjecture beyond moduli?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance conjecture states that for theories with moduli coupled to gravity a tower of states becomes light exponentially in the geodesic distance in moduli space. This specifies how effective field theories break down for large field values. However, phenomenological field theories have no moduli, but a scalar potential that deforms dynamical trajectories away from geodesic curves. In this note we speculate on how one should generalise the distance conjecture to include a scalar potential. We test the generalised distance conjecture in a few cases, demonstrate a link with pseudo-/fake supersymmetry and apply it to the ekpyrotic scenario in cosmology. For the latter we observe that the pre-uplift KKLT potential could provide a stringy embedding of ekpyrosis away from the asymptotic regimes in field space.</description>

      <title>On Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Thesis explores the notion of Krylov complexity as a probe of quantum chaos and as a candidate for holographic complexity. The first Part is devoted to presenting the fundamental notions required to conduct research in this area. Namely, an extensive introduction to the Lanczos algorithm, its properties and associated algebraic structures, as well as technical details related to its practical implementation, is given. Subsequently, an overview of the seminal references and the main debates regarding Krylov complexity and its relation to chaos and holography is provided. The text throughout this first Part combines review material with original analyses which either intend to contextualize, compare and criticize results in the literature, or are the fruit of the investigations leading to the publications on which this Thesis is based. These research projects are the subject of the second Part of the manuscript. In them, methods for the efficient implementation of the Lanczos algorithm in finite many-body systems were developed, allowing to compute numerically the Krylov complexity of models like SYK or the XXZ spin chain up to time scales exponentially large in system size. It was observed that the operator Krylov complexity profile in SYK, a paradigmatic low-dimensional chaotic system with a holographic dual, agrees with holographic expectations, while in the case of integrable models like XXZ complexity is affected by a novel localization effect in the so-called Krylov space which hinders its growth. Finally, an exact, analytical, correspondence between the Krylov complexity of the infinite-temperature thermofield double state in the low-energy regime of the double-scaled SYK model and bulk length in the theory of JT gravity is established.</description>

      <title>Celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ charges from a twistor action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in asymptotically flat spacetimes have a natural geometric interpretation on twistor space in terms of Poisson diffeomorphisms. Using this framework, we provide a first-principle derivation of the canonical generators associated with these symmetries starting from the Poisson BF twistor action for self-dual gravity. We express these charges as surface integrals over the celestial sphere in terms of spacetime data at null infinity. The connection between twistor space and spacetime expressions at $\mathscr{I}$ is achieved via an integral formula for the asymptotic Bianchi identities due to Bramson and Tod. Finally, we clarify how $Lw_{1+\infty}$ transformations are symmetries of gravity from a phase space perspective by showing the invariance of the asymptotic Bianchi identities.</description>

      <title>Cutkosky rules and 1-loop $\kappa$-deformed amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Cutkosky cutting rules are still valid term by term in the expansion in powers of $\kappa$ of the $\kappa$-deformed 1-loop correction to the propagator. We first present a general argument which relates each term in the expansion to a non-deformed amplitude containing additional propagators with mass $M&gt;\kappa$. We then show the same thing more pragmatically, by reducing the singularity structure of the coefficients in the expansion of the $\kappa$-deformed amplitude, to the singularity structure of non-deformed loop amplitudes, by using algebraic and analytic identities. We will explicitly show this up to second order in $1/\kappa$, but the technique can be generalized to higher orders in $1/\kappa$. Both the abstract and the more direct approach easily generalize to different deformed theories. We will then compute the full imaginary part of the $\kappa$-deformed 1-loop correction to the propagator in a specific model, up to second order in the expansion in $1/\kappa$, highlighting the usefulness of the approach for the phenomenology of deformed models. This explicitly confirms previous qualitative arguments concerning the behaviour of the decay width of unstable particles in the considered model.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic soft theorems and soft spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using universal predictions provided by classical soft theorems, we revisit the energy emission spectrum for gravitational scatterings of compact objects in the low-frequency expansion. We calculate this observable beyond the zero-frequency limit, retaining an exact dependence on the kinematics of the massive objects. This allows us to study independently the ultrarelativistic or massless limit, where we find agreement with the literature, and the small-deflection or post-Minkowskian (PM) limit, where we provide explicit results up to $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$. These confirm that the high-velocity limit of a given PM order is smoothly connected to the corresponding massless result whenever the latter is analytic in the Newton constant $G$. We also provide explicit expressions for the waveforms to order $\omega^{-1}$, $\log\omega$, $\omega(\log\omega)^2$ in the soft limit , $\omega\to0$, expanded up to sub-subleading PM order, as well as a conjecture for the logarithmic soft terms of the type $\omega^{n-1}(\log\omega)^{n}$ with $n\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Fermion Self-Energy and Effective Mass in a Noisy Magnetic Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the propagation of QED fermions in the presence of a classical background magnetic field with white-noise stochastic fluctuations. The effects of the magnetic field fluctuations are incorporated into the fermion and photon propagators in a quasi-particle picture, which we developed in previous works using the {\it replica trick}. By considering the strong-field limit, here we explicitly calculate the fermion self-energy involving radiative contributions at first-order in $\alpha_\text{em}$, in order to obtain the noise-averaged mass of the fermion propagating in the fluctuating magnetized medium. Our analytical results reveal a leading double-logarithmic contribution $\sim \left[\ln \left( |e B|/m^2 \right)\right]^2$ to the mass, with an imaginary part representing a spectral broadening proportional to the magnetic noise auto-correlation $\Delta$. While a uniform magnetic field already breaks Lorentz invariance, inducing the usual separation into two orthogonal subspaces (perpendicular and parallel with respect to the field), the presence of magnetic noise further breaks the remaining symmetry, thus leading to distinct spectral widths associated with fermion and anti-fermion, and their spin projection in the quasi-particle picture.</description>

      <title>Janus Deformation of de Sitter Space and Transitions in Gravitational Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a time-dependent $\mathcal{O}(1/G)$ deformation of pure de Sitter (dS) space in dS gravity coupled to a massless scalar field. It is the dS counterpart of the AdS Janus deformation and interpolates two asymptotically dS spaces in the far past and the far future with a single deformation parameter. The Penrose diagram can be elongated along the time direction indefinitely as the deformation becomes large. After studying the classical properties of the geometry such as the area theorem and the fluctuation by a matter field, we explore the algebraic structure of the field operators on the deformed spacetime. We argue that the algebra is a von Neumann factor of type II$_\infty$ for small deformations, but there occurs a transition to type I$_\infty$ as the deformation increases so that the neck region of the deformed space becomes a Lorentzian cylinder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an exponential modification for the action of an AdS black hole in the absence of a matter field. An approximated black hole solution is obtained up to the third order of perturbation coefficient. A thermodynamic investigation in canonical ensemble shows that the behavior of a Van der Waals fluid is not seen in this model. Nevertheless, the study of thermodynamic potentials and other related quantities suggests that the thermodynamic phase transitions of the first and second types can occur in this model. The forms of the phase transitions are more similar to the Hawking-Page phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectra of Quasinormal Modes and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic duality (also known as AdS/CFT correspondence or gauge/gravity duality) postulates that strongly coupled quantum field theories can be described in a dual way in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter space. One of the cornerstones of this duality is the description of thermal states as black holes with asymptotically Anti-de Sitter boundary conditions. This idea has led to valuable insights into such fields as transport theory and relativistic hydrodynamics. The quasinormal modes of such black holes play a decisive role and therefore their stability properties are of upmost interest for the holographic duality. We review recent results using the method of pseudospectra in this context.</description>

      <title>A new construction of $c=1$ Virasoro blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nonabelianization map for conformal blocks, which relates $c=1$ Virasoro blocks on a Riemann surface $C$ to Heisenberg blocks on a branched double cover $\widetilde{C}$ of $C$. The nonabelianization map uses the datum of a spectral network on $C$. It gives new formulas for Virasoro blocks as regularized Fredholm determinants of integral operators, with kernel given by an appropriate free-fermion two-point function on $\widetilde{C}$. The nonabelianization map also intertwines with the action of Verlinde loop operators, and can be used to construct eigenblocks. This leads to new Kyiv-type formulas and Fredholm determinant formulas for $\tau$-functions.</description>

      <title>On the nature of ensembles from gravitational path integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime wormholes in gravitational path integrals have long been interpreted in terms of ensembles of theories. Here we probe what sort of theories such ensembles might contain. Careful consideration of a simple $d=2$ topological model indicates that the Hilbert space structure of a general ensemble element fails to factorize over disconnected Cauchy-surface boundaries, and in particular that its Hilbert space ${\cal H}_{N_{CS\partial}}$ for $N_{CS\partial}$ Cauchy-surface boundaries fails to be positive definite when the number $N_{CS\partial}$ of disconnected such boundaries is large. This suggests a generalization of the AdS/CFT correspondence in which a bulk theory is dual to an ensemble of theories that deviate from standard CFTs by violating both locality and positivity (at least under certain circumstances). Since violations of positivity are undesirable, we propose that positivity-violating elements of the ensemble be removed when studying physics in asymptotically AdS spacetimes (or in other contexts in which Cauchy surfaces have asymptotic boundaries), perhaps reducing the ensemble to a single standard CFT. Nevertheless, properties of any remaining CFTs that are uncorrelated with positivity of ${\cal H}_{N_{CS\partial}}$ at large $N_{CS\partial}$will agree with those of typical elements of the full ensemble and may be computed using the ensemble average.
  On the other hand, elements that violate positivity at large $N_{CS\partial}$ can still have a positive-definite cosmological sector with $N_{CS\partial}=0$. Such elements then define a basis for a Hilbert space describing such cosmologies. In contrast to the cases in which Cauchy-surfaces are allowed to have boundaries, we argue that the resulting Hilbert space need not decohere into single-state theories. As a result, familiar physics might be more easily recovered from this new scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14706v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such prediction with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. In particular, we are able to predict and confirm that the CFT imply an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution. We show how to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including, the central charge, the operator content, and the generalized temporal entropies. Our results also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical fluctuations (such as the variance) of causal set quantities, with particular focus on the causal set action. To facilitate calculating such fluctuations, we develop tools to account for correlations between causal intervals with different cardinalities. We present a convenient decomposition of the fluctuations of the causal set action into contributions that depend on different kinds of correlations. This decomposition can be used in causal sets approximated by any spacetime manifold $\mathcal M$. Our work paves the way for investigating a number of interesting discreteness effects, such as certain aspects of the Everpresent $\Lambda$ cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Relational dynamics and Page-Wootters formalism in group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group field theory posits that spacetime is emergent and is hence defined without any background notion of space or time; dynamical questions are formulated in relational terms, in particular using (scalar) matter degrees of freedom as time. Unlike in canonical quantisation of gravitational systems, there is no obvious notion of coordinate transformations or constraints, and established quantisation methods cannot be directly applied. As a result, different canonical formalisms for group field theory have been discussed in the literature. We address these issues using a parametrised version of group field theory, in which all (geometry and matter) degrees of freedom evolve in a fiducial parameter. There is a constraint associated to the freedom of reparametrisation and the Dirac quantisation programme can be implemented. Using the "trinity of relational dynamics", we show that the resulting "clock-neutral" theory is entirely equivalent to a deparametrised canonical group field theory, interpreted in terms of the Page-Wootters formalism. Our results not only show that the deparametrised quantisation is fully covariant and can be seen as encoding the dynamics of joint quantum matter and geometry degrees of freedom, they also appear to be the first application of the Page-Wootters formalism directly to quantum gravity. We show extensions to a setting in which many independent gauge symmetries are introduced, which connects to the "multi-fingered time" idea in quantum gravity and provides a somewhat novel extension of the Page-Wootters formalism.</description>

      <title>Dark energy evolution from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If an ultraviolet fixed point renders quantum gravity renormalizable, the effective potential for a singlet scalar field -- the cosmon -- can be computed according to the corresponding scaling solution of the renormalization group equations. We associate the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the flow away from the fixed point with the scale of present dark energy density. This results in a highly predictive scenario for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. It solves the cosmological constant problem dynamically, and may be called "quantum gravity quintessence". A first setting without quantum scale symmetry violation in the neutrino sector could explain the present amount of dark energy, but fails for the constraints on its time evolution. In contrast, a logarithmic scale symmetry violation in the beyond standard model sector responsible for the neutrino masses induces a non-vanishing cosmon-neutrino coupling in the Einstein frame. This yields a cosmology similar to growing neutrino quintessence, which could be compatible with present observation. The small number of unknown parameters turns the scaling solution for quantum gravity into a fundamental explanation of dynamical dark energy which can be falsified.</description>

      <title>Testing the equivalence between the planar Gross-Neveu and Thirring models at $N=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the Fierz identities predict that the Gross-Neveu and Thirring models should be equivalent when describing systems composed of a single fermionic flavor, $N=1$. Here, we consider the planar version of both models within the framework of the optimized perturbation theory at the two loop level, in order to verify if the predicted equivalence emerges explicitly when different temperature and density regimes are considered. At vanishing densities, our results indicate that both models indeed describe exactly the same thermodynamics, provided that $N=1$. However, at finite chemical potentials we find that the $N=1$ Fierz equivalence no longer holds. After examining the relevant free energies, we have identified the contributions which lead to this puzzling discrepancy. Finally, we discuss different frameworks in which this (so far open) problem could be further understood and eventually circumvented.</description>

      <title>Stability of a realistic astrophysical pulsar and its mass-radius relation in higher-order curvature gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this research is to explore compact celestial objects while considering the framework of an extended gravitational theory known as $\mathcal{R}+f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. The notations $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ denote the Ricci scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, respectively. Radio pulsars, which are neutron stars with masses greater than 1.8 times that of the Sun ($M_\odot$), provide exceptional opportunities for delving into fundamental physics in extraordinary environments unparalleled in the observable universe and surpassing the capabilities of experiments conducted on Earth. Through the utilization of both the linear and quadratic expressions of the function { $f(\mathcal{G}) = \alpha_1 \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\alpha_1$ (with dimensional units of [${\textit length}^6$]) are incorporated}, we have achieved an accurate analytical solution for anisotropic perfect-fluid spheres in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. By integrating the dimensional parameters $\alpha_1$ and the compactness factor, defined as ${\mathcal C=\frac{2GM}{Rc^2}}$, we showcase our capacity to encompass and depict all physical characteristics within the stellar structure. We illustrate that the model is capable of producing a stable arrangement encompassing its physical and geometric properties. We illustrate that by utilizing the quadratic form of $\mathcal{G}$ in the $\mathcal{R}+f(\mathcal{G})$ framework, the ansatz of Krori-Barua establishes connection between pressure in the radial direction ($p_r$) using semi-analytical methods, pressure in the tangential direction ($p_t$), and density ($\rho$).</description>

Abstract: We point out that the q-entropy composition for independent events has exactly the same form as the Pythagorean theorem in hyperbolic geometry. We justify the formal relation of hyperbolic geometry with the q-entropy through the use of the $\kappa$-entropy, which is directly related to the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space. We comment on the relation between orthogonality in this form of the Pythagorean theorem and the independence of the probability distributions appearing in the q-entropy composition through the use of the Dvoretzky-Rogers lemma.</description>

      <title>Refined Thermodynamics of Black Holes with Proper Conserved Charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field equations of a classical, geometric, theory of gravity, augmented with some semiclassical considerations strongly suggest that the gravitational field representing a stationary black hole can be simply described with a few thermodynamical coordinates and their conjugates that obey the four laws of thermodynamics plus the Smarr formula and the reverse isoperimetric inequality that bounds the maximum entropy for a given effective volume of space. Thermodynamics of black holes is a promising window to the quantum nature of black holes and hence it is important to understand all the details of these laws. The identification and the meaning of these thermodynamic coordinates depend on the gravity theory under consideration. For example, the existence of dimensionful coupling constants, such as the cosmological constant, changes the scaling properties of the theory, its solutions, and the laws of thermodynamics. Here we show, using the background Killing charge method which applies to any gravity theory, how the thermodynamics of black holes such as the $D$ dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes in cosmological Einstein's theory and the spherically symmetric black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory changes. We give the effective volume of black holes which are regular in every dimension even in the absence of a cosmological constant. The methods applied here can be used in any geometric theory of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the ground states of a chiral magnet with a square anisotropy and show that it supports domain wall networks as stable ground states. A domain wall junction in the domain wall network turns out to be a skyrmion with half topological charge and, therefore, the found domain wall network has a second topological nature, a skyrmion crystal. More specifically, we present a ground-state phase diagram of the chiral magnet with varying anisotropy parameters consisting of skyrmion lattices, chiral soliton lattices, and ferromagnetic states. In the presence of the square anisotropy, the skyrmion crystal forms a domain wall network. The size of domains in the domain wall network is shown to be tunable by an external magnetic field, offering a way to realize experimentally detectable domain wall networks.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a formalism for constructing cohomological field theories (CohFT) out of nonlinear PDEs based on the first author's previous work (arXiv:2202.12425). We apply the formalism to the generalized Seiberg-Witten equations and show that the obtained CohFT functionals agree with the existing ones proposed by physicists. This leads to a unified perspective from which to view the full supersymmetric functionals of the Donaldson-Witten, Seiberg-Witten, and Kapustin-Witten theories and understand the relations between them. We also outline a quantization program for our framework and discuss its potential to produce manifold invariants and quantum cohomologies.</description>

      <title>Geometric relational framework for general-relativistic gauge field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We remind how relationality arises as the core insight of general-relativistic gauge field theories from the articulation of the generalised hole and point-coincidence arguments. Hence, a compelling case for a manifestly relational framework ensues naturally. We propose our formulation for such a framework, based on a significant development of the dressing field method of symmetry reduction.
  We first develop a version for the group $\text{Aut}(P)$ of automorphisms of a principal bundle $P$ over a manifold $M$, as it is the most natural and elegant, and as $P$ hosts all the mathematical structures relevant to general-relativistic gauge field theory. Yet, as the standard formulation is local, on $M$, we then develop the relational framework for local field theory. It manifestly implements the generalised point-coincidence argument, whereby the physical field-theoretical degrees of freedoms co-define each other and define, coordinatise, the physical spacetime itself. Applying the framework to General Relativity, we obtain relational Einstein equations, encompassing various notions of "scalar coordinatisation" \`a la Kretschmann-Komar and Brown-Kucha\v{r}.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose a new $S$-matrix approach to numerical simulations of network models and apply it to random networks that we proposed in a previous work 10.1103/PhysRevB.95.125414. Random networks are modifications of the Chalker-Coddington (CC) model for the integer quantum Hall transition that more faithfully capture the physics of electrons moving in a strong magnetic field and a smooth disorder potential. The new method has considerable advantages compared to the transfer matrix approach, and gives the value $\nu \approx 2.4$ for the critical exponent of the localization length in a random network. This finding confirms our previous result and is surprisingly close to the experimental value $\nu_{\text{exp}} \approx 2.38$ observed at the integer quantum Hall transition but substantially different from the CC value $\nu_\text{CC} \approx 2.6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dust ball with an electrically charged central core and study its quantum spectrum by quantising the geodesic equation for individual dust particles in the corresponding Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime. As in the neutral case investigated previously, we find a ground state of the dust ball with the size of a fraction of the outer horizon. Moreover, we determine a self-consistent configuration of layers in the ground state corresponding to an effective mass function that increases linearly with the areal radius and has no inner horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the holographic representation of the quantum theory of transmission lines, which play a crucial role in quantum computing and quantum information. Utilizing Yurke and Denker's quantum circuit network theory within the framework of continuous MERA (cMERA) in AdS space, we analyze the quantization and interactions of transmission lines. The metric is revealed to be described by the inductance of the quantum circuit, which is AdS-space in its 0-limit. These results provide new insights into handling and controlling complex phenomena in quantum circuits, potentially advancing the understanding of quantum computing and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schwinger mechanism in QCD, and Fredholm alternatives theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of the Schwinger mechanism in QCD, which fixes uniquely the scale of the effective gluon mass and streamlines considerably the procedure of multiplicative renormalization. The key advantage of this method stems from the nonlinear nature of the dynamical equation that generates massless poles in the longitudinal sector of the three-gluon vertex. An exceptional feature of this approach is an extensive cancellation involving the components of the integral expression that determines the gluon mass; it is triggered once the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the pole-free part of the three-gluon vertex has been appropriately exploited. It turns out that this cancellation is driven by the so-called Fredholm alternatives theorem, which operates among the set of integral equations describing this system. Quite remarkably, in the linearized approximation this theorem enforces the exact masslessness of the gluon. Instead, the nonlinearity induced by the full treatment of the relevant kernel evades this theorem, allowing for the emergence of a nonvanishing mass. The numerical results obtained from the resulting equations are compatible with the lattice findings, and may be further refined through the inclusion of the remaining fundamental vertices of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In standard quantum electrodynamics (QED), the so-called non-minimal (Pauli) coupling is suppressed for elementary particles and has no physical implications. Here, we show that the Pauli term naturally appears in a known family of Dirac materials -- the lead-halide perovskites, suggesting a novel playground for the study of analogue QED effects. We outline measurable manifestations of the Pauli term in the phenomena pertaining to (i) the Klein paradox and (ii) relativistic corrections to bound states. In particular, we demonstrate that the binding energy of an electron in the vicinity of a positively charged defect is noticeably decreased due to the polarizability of lead ions and the appearance of a Darwin-like term. Our study adds to understanding of quantum phenomena in lead-halide perovskites, and paves the way for tabletop simulations of analogue Dirac-Pauli equations.</description>

Abstract: Observational data of the Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) shadow released by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) are used to investigate eventual deviations in the black hole shadow radius, aiming to seek physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) coming from extra-dimensional theory. We consider the brane-world scenario described by the Randall-Sundrum model and determine the black hole shadow radius correction owing to the higher dimension. From data of the shadow radius in units of BH mass determined by KECK- and VLTI-based estimates, we imposed restrictions on the deviation obtained, and one sets an upper limit to the curvature radius of Anti-de Sitter ($\mathrm{AdS_{5}}$) spacetime $\ell\lesssim4.3\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{AU}$ (at $95\%$ confidence level).</description>

      <title>The gravitational eikonal: from particle, string and brane collisions to black-hole encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by conceptual problems in quantum theories of gravity, the gravitational eikonal approach, inspired by its electromagnetic predecessor, has been successfully applied to the transplanckian energy collisions of elementary particles and strings since the late eighties, and to string-brane collisions in the past decade. After the direct detection of gravitational waves from black-hole mergers, most of the attention has shifted towards adapting these methods to the physics of black-hole encounters. For such systems, the eikonal exponentiation provides an amplitude-based approach to calculate classical gravitational observables, thus complementing more traditional analytic methods such as the Post-Newtonian expansion, the worldline formalism, or the Effective-One-Body approach. In this review we summarize the main ideas and techniques behind the gravitational eikonal formalism. We discuss how it can be applied in various different physical setups involving particles, strings and branes and then we mainly concentrate on the most recent developments, focusing on massive scalars minimally coupled to gravity, for which we aim at being as self-contained and comprehensive as possible.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic growth of the degeneracy of the BPS local operators with scaling dimension $n/2$ in the three-dimensional superconformal field theories describing $N$ M2-branes. From the large $N$ supersymmetric indices we obtain the asymptotic formulas for degeneracies of the M2-brane SCFTs according to the Meinardus theorem. We observe an intriguing universal $n^{2/3}$ growth of the degeneracies in various theories of M2-brane SCFTs. We also determine the coefficients of $n^{2/3}$ growth as well as further corrections in these theories explicitly.</description>

      <title>Constructing all BPS black hole microstates from the gravitational path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how to prepare and count black hole micro-states by using the gravitational path integral is one of the most important problems in quantum gravity. Nevertheless, a state-by-state count of black hole microstates is difficult because the apparent number of degrees of freedom available in the gravitational effective theory can vastly exceed the entropy of the black hole, even in the special case of BPS black holes. In this paper, we show that we can use the gravitational path integral to prepare a basis for the Hilbert space of all BPS black hole microstates. We find that the dimension of this Hilbert space computed by an explicit state count is in complete agreement with the degeneracy obtained from the Gibbons-Hawking prescription. Specifically, this match includes all non-perturbative corrections in $1/G_N$. Such corrections are, in turn, necessary in order for this degeneracy of BPS states to match the non-perturbative terms in the $1/G_N$ expansion in the string theory count of such microstates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that for near-extremal black holes, the entropy and the energy above extremality respectively receive a logT and a T-linear correction, where T is the temperature. We show that both these features can be derived in a low but not too low temperature regime, by assuming the existence of exponentially many low lying states cleanly separated from rest of the spectrum, without using any specific theory. Argument of the logarithm in the expression of entropy is seen to be the ratio of temperature and the bandwidth of the low lying states. We argue that such spectrum might arise in non-supersymmetric extremal brane systems. Our findings strengthen Page's suggestion that there is no true degeneracy for non-supersymmetric extremal black holes.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the trajectory of the Lee-Yang edge singularities of the QCD equation of state in the complex baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) plane for different values of the temperature by using the recent lattice results for the Taylor expansion coefficients up to eighth order in $\mu_B$ and various resummation techniques that blend in Pade expansions and conformal maps. By extrapolating from this information, we estimate for the location of the QCD critical point, $ T_c \approx 100$ MeV, $\mu_c \approx 580$ MeV. We also estimate the crossover slope at the critical point to be $\alpha_1 \approx 9^\circ$ and further constrain the non-universal mapping parameters between the three dimensional Ising model and QCD equations of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In current studies for testing Bell inequalities at colliders, the reconstruction of spin correlations from scattering cross-sections relies on the bilinear form of the spin correlations, but not all local hidden variable models (LHVMs) have such a property. To demonstrate that a general LHVM cannot be rule out via scattering cross-section data, we propose a specific LHVM, which can exactly duplicate the same scattering cross-section for particle production and decay as the standard quantum theory, making it indistinguishable at colliders in principle. Despite of this, we find that reconstructing spin correlations through scattering cross-sections can still exclude a broad class of LHVMs, e.g., those models employing classical spin correlations as a surrogate for quantum spin correlations.</description>

We consider the moment of inertia $I$ as a kind of transport coefficient, identified with the moment of inertia of a charged rotating black hole in $AdS_4$ background. In the low-temperature region, we find the behaviour of the density $I/A$ with temperature $T$ and angular velocity $\Omega$, and find a quadratic behaviour for $\partial(I/A)/\partial\Omega$ with $T$, in the presence of some charge $Q$.</description>

      <title>A Non-Abelian Gauge Theory for Surface Excitations of $~^3$He-B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $~^3$He-B, two atoms pair in an orbital angular momentum $1$ spin triplet state above the phase transition temperature with $SO(3) \times SO(3)$ symmetry. Below the transition temperature, this symmetry is spontaneously broken to the diagonal $SO(3)$ due to spin-orbit coupling. Considerations based on effective potentials and solitons show that $SO(3)$'s gets enhanced to $SU(3)$'s and the symmetry breaking is that of $G= SU(3) \times SU(3)\times U(1)$ to $H= SU(3)$. The theory of the resultant Goldtsone modes can be naturally formulated as a gauge theory of $H$. Its Gauss law is treated here and shown to lead to surface states in a container with a dynamics governed by large gauge transformations.
  Observable consequences are pointed. The transference of the analysis to the chiral model of QCD is pointed out where $SU(3)$ are the left and right chiral groups, $U(1)$ is the axial $U(1)$ , the surviving symmetry is flavour $SU(3)$ and the Goldstone modes are the pions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a microscopic definition of finite cut-off JT quantum gravity on the disk, both in the discretized and in the continuum points of view. The discretized formulation involves a new model of so-called self-overlapping random polygons. The measure is not uniform, implying that the degrees of freedom are not in one-to-one correspondence with the shape of the boundary. The continuum formulation is based on a boundary $\text{CFT}_{1}$ from which we predict some critical exponents of the self-overlapping polygon model. The coupling to an arbitrary bulk matter CFT is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Null Infinity as a Weakly Isolated Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Null infinity arises as a boundary of the Penrose conformal completion of an asymptotically flat physical space-time. We first note that null infinity is a weakly isolated horizon (WIH), and then show that its familiar properties can be derived from the general WIH framework. This seems quite surprising because physics associated with black hole (and cosmological) WIHs is very different from that extracted at null infinity. We show that these differences can be directly traced back to the fact that null infinity is a WIH in the conformal completion rather than the physical space-time. In particular, the BMS group at null infinity stems from the symmetry group of WIHs. In a companion paper, we obtain fluxes and charges associated with symmetries associated with both null infinity and black hole (and cosmological) horizons using a new Hamiltonian framework. The fact that is there is a single mathematical framework underlying these different situations paves the way to explore the relation between horizon dynamics in the strong field region and waveforms at infinity. It should also be useful in the analysis of black hole evaporation in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Towards complexity in de Sitter space from the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we define complexity in dS space from microscopic principles? Based on recent developments pointing towards a correspondence between a pair of double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) models/ 2D Liouville-de Sitter (LdS$_2$) field theory/ 3D Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS$_3$) space in arXiv:2310.16994, arXiv:2402.00635, arXiv:2402.02584, we study concrete complexity proposals in the microscopic models and their dual descriptions. First, we examine the spread complexity of the maximal entropy state of the doubled DSSYK model. We show that it counts the number of entangled chord states in its doubled Hilbert space. We interpret spread complexity in terms of a time difference between antipodal observers in SdS$_3$ space, and a boundary time difference of the dual LdS$_2$ CFTs. This provides a new connection between entanglement and geometry in dS space. Second, Krylov complexity, which describes operator growth, is computed for physical operators on all sides of the correspondence. Their late time evolution behaves as expected for chaotic systems. Later, we define the query complexity in the LdS$_2$ model as the number of steps in an algorithm computing n-point correlation functions of boundary operators of the corresponding antipodal points in SdS$_3$ space. We interpret query complexity as the number of matter operator chord insertions in a cylinder amplitude in the DSSYK, and the number of junctions of Wilson lines between antipodal static patch observers in SdS$_3$ space. Finally, we evaluate a specific proposal of Nielsen complexity for the DSSYK model and comment on its possible dual manifestations.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Emergence of $R^4$-terms in M-theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently suggested that the strong Emergence Proposal is realized in M-theory limits by integrating out all light towers of states with a typical mass scale not larger than the species scale, i.e. the eleventh dimensional Planck mass. Within the BPS sector, these are transverse $M2$- and $M5$-branes, that can be wrapped and particle-like, carrying Kaluza-Klein momentum along the compact directions. We provide additional evidence for this picture by revisiting and investigating further the computation of $R^4$-interactions in M-theory \`a la Green-Gutperle-Vanhove. A central aspect is a novel UV-regularization of Schwinger-like integrals, whose actual meaning and power we clarify by first applying it to string perturbation theory. We consider then toroidal compactifications of M-theory and provide evidence that integrating out all light towers of states via Schwinger-like integrals thus regularized yields the complete result for $R^4$-interactions. In particular, this includes terms that are tree-level, one-loop and space-time instanton corrections from the weakly coupled point of view. Finally, we comment on the conceptual difference of our approach to earlier closely related work by Kiritsis-Pioline and Obers-Pioline, leading to a correspondence between two types of constrained Eisenstein series.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of RG flow in emergent dual holography of worldsheet nonlinear $\sigma$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the renormalization group (RG) flow of worldsheet bosonic string theory, we construct an effective holographic dual description of the target space theory identifying the RG scale with the emergent extra dimension. This results in an effective dilaton-gravity theory, analogous to the low-energy description of bosonic M-theory. We argue that this holographic dual effective field theory is non-perturbative in the $\alpha'$ expansion. To investigate the monotonicity of RG flow of the metric in the emergent spacetime, we consider entropy production along the RG flow. We construct a microscopic entropy functional based on the probability distribution function of the holographic dual effective field theory, regarded as Gibbs or Shannon entropy. Given that the Ricci flow represents the 1-loop RG flow equation of the target space metric for the 2D non-linear sigma model, and motivated by Perelman's proof of the monotonicity of Ricci flow, we propose a Perelman's entropy functional for the holographic dual effective field theory. Furthermore, utilizing the equivalence between the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the local RG equation, we show that the RG flow of holographic Perelman's entropy functional is the Weyl anomaly. This eventually verify the monotonicity of RG flow for the emergent target spacetime. Interestingly, we find that the microscopic entropy production rate can be determined by integrating the rate of change of the holographic Perelman's entropy functional over all possible metric configurations along the flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering amplitude of massless scalars on the world volume of an infinite $D = 11$ supermembrane quantized in the static gauge. The resulting expression is manifestly finite and turns out to be much simpler than in the bosonic membrane case in arXiv:2308.12189 being simply proportional to the tree-level scattering amplitude. We also consider the case of $\mathbb{R}^{1,1} \times S^1$ membrane with one dimension compactified on a circle of radius R and demonstrate how the supermembrane scattering amplitude reduces to the one on an infinite $D = 10$ Green-Schwarz superstring in the limit of R $\rightarrow 0$.</description>

      <title>Double Copy of 3D Chern-Simons Theory and 6D Kodaira-Spencer Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply an algebraic double copy construction of gravity from gauge theory to three-dimensional (3D) Chern-Simons theory. The kinematic algebra ${\cal K}$ is the 3D de Rham complex of forms equipped, for a choice of metric, with a graded Lie algebra that is equivalent to the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket on polyvector fields. The double copied gravity is defined on a subspace of ${\cal K}\otimes \bar{\cal K}$ and yields a topological double field theory for a generalized metric perturbation and two 2-forms. This local and gauge invariant theory is non-Lagrangian but can be rendered Lagrangian by abandoning locality. Upon fixing a gauge this reduces to the double copy of Chern-Simons theory previously proposed by Ben-Shahar and Johansson. Furthermore, using complex coordinates in $\mathbb{C}^3$ this theory is related to six-dimensional (6D) Kodaira-Spencer gravity in that truncating the two 2-forms and one equation yields the Kodaira-Spencer equations on a 3D real slice of $\mathbb{C}^3$. The full 6D Kodaira-Spencer theory can instead be obtained as a consistent truncation of a chiral double copy.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution and Thermal Renormalization Group Flow in Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-evolution of the Universe as described by the Friedmann equation can be coupled to equations of motion of matter fields. Quantum effects may be incorporated to improve these classical equations of motion by the renormalization group (RG) running of their couplings. Since temporal and thermal evolutions are linked to each other, astrophysical and cosmological treatements based on zero-temperature RG methods require the extension to finite-temperatures. We propose and explore a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units), where $k_T$ is acting as a running cutoff for thermal fluctuations and the momentum $k$ can be used for the quantum fluctuations. In this approach, the temperature of the expanding Universe is related to the dimensionless quantity $\tau$ (and not to $k_T$). We show that by this choice dimensionless RG flow equations have no explicit $k$-dependence, as it is convenient. We also discuss how this modified thermal RG is used to handle high-energy divergences of the RG running of the cosmological constant and to "solve the triviality"of the $\phi^4$ model by a thermal phase transition in terms of $\tau$ in $d=4$ Euclidean dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We study junctions between confining strings. We show that the effective theory of such junctions is very predictive with only one new parameter, the junction's mass, controlling the first couple of terms in the expansion in the system size. By open-closed duality these considerations about the baryon junction map to interaction vertices of closed strings. Therefore, we calculate the interaction vertices of closed strings in theories such as Yang-Mills theory. We find some surprising selection rules for string interactions in 3+1 dimensions. Requiring perturbative stability and that the string coupling is weak, we suggest constraints on the junction's mass.</description>

      <title>A 3D Field-Theoretic Example for Hodge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the continuous symmetry transformations for the three ($2 + 1$)-dimensional (3D) system of a combination of the free Abelian 1-form and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism. We establish that this combined system is a tractable field-theoretic model of Hodge theory. The symmetry operators of our present theory provide the physical realizations of the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry at the algebraic level. Our present investigation is important in the sense that, for the first time, we are able to establish an odd dimensional (i.e. $D = 3$) field-theoretic system to be an example for Hodge theory (besides earlier works on a few interesting ($0 + 1$)-dimensional toy models as well as a set of well-known ${\mathcal N} = 2$ SUSY quantum mechanical systems of physical interest). For the sake of brevity, we have not taken into account the 3D Chern-Simon term for the Abelian 1-form gauge field in our theory which allows the mass and gauge-invariance to co-exist together.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss in detail the $1+1$-dimensional superconformal field theory dual to type II string theory on $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$, emphasizing the string theoretic aspects of this duality. For one unit of NS-NS 5-brane flux ($Q_5=1$), this string theory has been suggested to be dual to a grand-canonical ensemble of $T^{4N}/S_N$ free symmetric orbifold CFTs. We show how the string genus expansion emerges to all orders for the free orbifold grand-canonical correlation functions. We also discuss how the strong coupling limit of the NS-NS string theory arises (even at large $N$) in the free orbifold description, and argue why this limit does not have a weakly coupled R-R description. The dual CFT includes (for all values of $Q_5$) an extra $T^4$ factor that is decoupled from perturbative string theory. We discuss the exactly marginal deformations that relate the different values of $Q_5$, including the precise $J{\bar J}$ deformations mixing this extra $T^4$ with the symmetric orbifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximated functional renormalization group (FRG) equations lead to regulator-dependent $\beta$-functions, in analogy to the scheme-dependence of the perturbative renormalization group (pRG) approach. A scheme transformation redefines the couplings to relate the $\beta$-functions of the FRG method with an arbitrary regulator function to the pRG ones obtained in a given scheme. Here, we consider a periodic sine-Gordon scalar field theory in $d=2$ dimensions and show that the relation of the FRG and pRG approaches is intricate. Although, both the FRG and the pRG methods are known to be sufficient to obtain the critical frequency $\beta_c^2 =8\pi$ of the model independently of the choice of the regulator and the renormalization scheme, we show that one has to go beyond the standard pRG method (e.g., using an auxiliary mass term) or the Coulomb-gas representation in order to obtain the $\beta$-function of the wave function renormalization. This aspect makes the scheme transformation non-trivial. Comparing flow equations of the two-dimensional sine-Gordon theory without any scheme-transformation, i.e., redefinition of couplings, we find that the auxiliary mass pRG $\beta$-functions of the minimal subtraction scheme can be recovered within the FRG approach with the choice of the power-law regulator with $b=2$, therefore constitutes a preferred choice for the comparison of FRG and pRG flows.</description>

Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>

Abstract: We study supersymmetric solutions of matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity in the forms of $AdS_2\times S^3$- and $AdS_3\times S^2$-sliced domain walls with a non-vanishing two-form field from the supergravity multiplet. These two types of solutions holographically describe conformal line and surface defects within five-dimensional $N=2$ SCFTs, respectively. In the case of $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group obtained by coupling $F(4)$ supergravity to three vector multiplets, we find charged domain wall solutions describing holographic RG flows between two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua with a running two-form field supporting the line and surface defects. For a particular case of one vector multiplet with $SO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group, we find solutions describing RG flows from an $AdS_6$ vacuum to physically acceptable singular geometries in the presence of defects. This class of solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory using a consistent truncation obtained from $SO(5,5)$ exceptional field theory with half-maximal structures.</description>

Abstract: We provide a deformation quantization, in the sense of Rieffel, for \textit{all} globally hyperbolic spacetimes with a Poisson structure. The Poisson structures have to satisfy Fedosov type requirements in order for the deformed product to be associative. We apply the novel deformation to quantum field theories and their respective states and we prove that the deformed state (i.e.\ a state in non-commutative spacetime) has a singularity structure resembling Minkowski, i.e.\ is \textit{Hadamard}, if the undeformed state is Hadamard. This proves that the Hadamard condition, and hence the quantum field theoretical implementation of the equivalence principle is a general concept that holds in spacetimes with quantum features (i.e. a non-commutative spacetime).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the four-velocity of a Dirac particle is related to its relativistic wave function by $u^i=\bar{\psi}\gamma^i\psi/\bar{\psi}\psi$. This relativistic wave$-$particle duality relation is demonstrated for a free particle related to a plane wave in a flat spacetime. For a curved spacetime with torsion, the momentum four-vector of a spinor is related to a generator of translation, given by a covariant derivative. The spin angular momentum four-tensor of a spinor is related to a generator of rotation in the Lorentz group. We use the covariant conservation laws for the spin and energy$-$momentum tensors for a spinor field in the presence of the Einstein$-$Cartan torsion to show that if the wave satisfies the curved Dirac equation, then the four-velocity, four-momentum, and spin satisfy the classical Mathisson$-$Papapetrou equations of motion. We show that these equations reduce to the geodesic equation. Consequently, the motion of a particle guided by the four-velocity in the pilot-wave quantum mechanics coincides with the geodesic motion determined by spacetime. We also show how the duality and the operator form of the Mathisson$-$Papapetrou equations arise from the covariant Heisenberg equation of motion in the presence of torsion.</description>

      <title>\boldmath $SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity: Emergence of Gravity in an Infinitely Divisible Quantum Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02813v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $SU(\infty)$-QGR is a foundationally quantum approach to gravity. It assumes that the Hilbert space of the Universe as a whole represents the symmetry group $SU(\infty)$, and demonstrates this symmetry for Hilbert spaces of infinite number of subsystems that randomly emerge and represent arbitrary finite rank internal symmetries. It is shown that their states depend on a dimensionful parameter arising due to the breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry, and a relative dynamics can be defined by selection of a subsystem as clock. The action has the form of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory defined on the (3+1)-dimensional parameter space for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries. Therefore, $SU(\infty)$-QGR is renormalizable, but predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity. Nonetheless, it is proved that when quantum gravity effects are not detectable, dynamics is similar to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The aim of present work is in depth study of the foundation and properties of this model. In particular, we show that the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry manifests itself through the entanglement of subsystems with the rest of the Universe, and demonstrate irrelevance of geometry of the parameter space for observables. Hence, $SU(\infty)$-QGR deviates from gauge-gravity duality models, because the classical spacetime is an emergent effective geometry with negative signature, reflecting relative variation of quantum states of subsystems and quantum uncertainties. We also briefly discuss $SU(\infty)$-QGR specific models for dark energy.</description>

Abstract: Effective relativistic field theory models capable of realizing various gapless topological states are presented in this work. We study the topological phase transitions of the Weyl and nodal line semimetal states in effective field theories. When the one form field giving rise to the Weyl nodes lie perpendicular to the plane where the nodal ring lives, the nodal ring and Weyl nodes could coexist as the mirror symmetry responsible for the nodal ring is not broken. New phases including a three-node state and a triple degenerate state exist. The nodal ring is immediately destroyed when the one form field lies in the plane of the ring. However, we show that in an eight-component spinor model, Weyl nodes and nodal rings could still coexist even when the one form field is parallel to the plane, due to the expanded symmetry. Topological invariants are calculated which confirm the interesting nontrivial topology of the three-node state and the triple-degenerate node. This work presents potential topological phase transitions in multiphase topological systems, which may be experimentally detected.</description>

      <title>The p-Adic Schr\"odinger Equation and the Two-slit Experiment in Quantum Mechanics</title>

Abstract: p-Adic quantum mechanics is constructed from the Dirac-von Neumann axioms identifying quantum states with square-integrable functions on the N-dimensional p-adic space. This choice is equivalent to the hypothesis of the discreteness of the space. The time is assumed to be a real variable. The p-adic quantum mechanics is motivated by the question: what happens with the standard quantum mechanics if the space has a discrete nature? The time evolution of a quantum state is controlled by a nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger equation obtained from a p-adic heat equation by a temporal Wick rotation. This p-adic heat equation describes a particle performing a random motion in the N-dimensional p-adic space. The Hamiltonian is a nonlocal operator; thus, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation describes the evolution of a quantum state under nonlocal interactions. In this framework, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation admits complex-valued plane wave solutions, which we interpret as p-adic de Broglie waves. These mathematical waves have all wavelength 1/p. In the p-adic framework, the double-slit experiment cannot be explained using the interference of the de Broglie waves. The wavefunctions can be represented as convergent series in the de Broglie waves, but the p-adic de Broglie waves are just mathematical objects. Only the square of the modulus of a wave function has a physical meaning as a time-dependent probability density. These probability densities exhibit interference patterns similar to the ones produced by `quantum waves.' In the p-adic framework, in the double-slit experiment, each particle goes through one slit only.</description>

      <title>Bouncing cosmology and dynamical analysis of stability with non-minimal kinetic coupled gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the bounce phase, stability and the reconstruction of the universe by non-minimal kinetic coupling. In the process, we obtained importance information about the energy density and the matter pressure of the universe in relation to the previous universe through the bounce quantum phase. The novelty of the work is that the scale factor is obtained directly from the model and is fitted with an exponential function, with this view we explore the process of the early universe even the bounce phase. After that, we plot the cosmological parameters in terms of time evolution. In what follows, we investigate the stability of the model by the dynamical system analysis in a phase plane. Finally, we examine the stability of the universe, especially in the inflationary period, by using the phase space trajectories.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Symmetry Operators in Kerr--NUT--AdS Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the Kerr--NUT--AdS spacetimes possess hidden symmetries encoded in the so-called principal Killing--Yano tensor. In this paper, focusing on the four-dimensional case, we obtain a number of symmetry operators for scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, that are of degree two (to be defined below) and homogeneous in the principal tensor. In particular, by considering homogeneous operators that are linear, quadratic, and cubic in the principal tensor, we recover a complete set of 4 mutually commuting operators for scalar perturbations, underlying the separability of (massive) scalar wave equation. Proceeding to vector and tensor perturbations of the Kerr--NUT--AdS spacetimes, we find a set of 7 and 8 commuting operators, respectively. It remains to be seen whether such operators can be used to separate the corresponding spin 1 and spin 2 test field equations in these spacetimes.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, it has been shown that discrete and continuous media can support topologically nontrivial waves. Recently, it was shown that the same is true of the vacuum, namely, right (R) and left (L) circularly polarized photons are topologically nontrivial. Here, we study the topology of another class of massless particles, namely gravitons. We show that the collection of all gravitons forms a topologically trivial vector bundle over the lightcone, allowing us to construct a globally smooth basis for gravitons. The graviton bundle also has a natural geometric splitting into two topologically nontrivial subbundles, consisting of the R and L gravitons. The R and L gravitons are unitary irreducible bundle representations of the Poincar\'{e} group, and are thus elementary particles; their topology is characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 4$. This nontrivial topology obstructs the splitting of graviton angular momentum into spin and orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>NLO thermal corrections to dark matter annihilation cross sections: a novel approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark matter relic density has been increasingly accurately measured by successive generations of experiments. The Boltzmann equation determines the yields using the dark matter annihilation cross section as one of the inputs; the accurate computation of the latter including thermal contributions thus assumes importance. We report here the next-to-leading order (NLO) thermal corrections to the cross sections for (Majorana) dark matter annihilation to standard model fermions: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$, via charged scalars. We use a novel approach, utilising the technique of Grammer and Yennie, extended to thermal field theories, where the cancellation of soft infra-red divergences occurs naturally. We present the NLO thermal cross sections in full detail for both the relativistic case as well as in the non-relativistic limit. Our independent calculation verifies earlier results where the leading contribution at order ${\cal{O}}(T^2)$ was shown to be proportional to the square of the fermion mass in the non-relativistic limit, just as at leading order. We find that the ${\cal{O}}(T^4)$ contributions have the same dependence on the fermion mass as well.</description>

      <title>Steady electric currents in magnetized QCD and their use for the equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the emergence of steady electric currents in QCD as a response to a non-uniform magnetic background using lattice simulations with 2 + 1 quark flavors at the physical point, as well as leading-order chiral perturbation theory. Using these currents, we develop a novel method to determine the leading-order coefficient of the equation of state in a magnetic field expansion: the magnetic susceptibility of the QCD medium. We decompose the current expectation value into valence- and sea-quark contributions and demonstrate that the dominant contribution to the electric current is captured by the valence term alone, allowing for a comparably cheap determination of the susceptibility. Our continuum extrapolated lattice results for the equation of state confirm the findings of some of the existing studies in the literature, namely that the QCD medium behaves diamagnetically at low and paramagnetically at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective potential of the $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated with varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. These phenomena indicate that the applicable energy range of $O(N)$ model is more and more limited as $m_\pi$ becoming larger and temperature going higher. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Vacuum of Spacetime with a Fundamental Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum theory of gravity implies a fine-grained structure of spacetime, which can be conveniently modeled as some form of pixelation at the Planck scale, with potentially observable consequences. In this work, we build upon previous results to investigate the effect of pixelation on the quantum vacuum, making use of the framework of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR). At the center of the DSR approach is an observer dependent length scale, defining the pixelation of spacetime. A key feature of quantum field theory in DSR is the dispersive nature of the vacuum state and the associated appearance of curvature in momentum space. As a result, the standard treatment of the renormalized stress-energy-momentum tensor acquires correction terms. As an illustration, we present here a calculation of the thermal vacuum and modified Casimir effect, using both modified propagators and momentum measures. We choose a consistent choice of momentum space metric that both generates the modified dispersion relations we use and preserves the Lorentz invariant character of the results obtained. Put together this constitutes a consistent calculation framework we can apply to other more complex scenarios.</description>
