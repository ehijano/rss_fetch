      <title>Counter-monotonic risk allocations and distortion risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In risk-sharing markets with aggregate uncertainty, characterizing Pareto-optimal allocations when agents might not be risk averse is a challenging task, and the literature has only provided limited explicit results thus far. In particular, Pareto optima in such a setting may not necessarily be comonotonic, in contrast to the case of risk-averse agents. In fact, when market participants are risk-seeking, Pareto-optimal allocations are counter-monotonic. Counter-monotonicity of Pareto optima also arises in some situations for quantile-optimizing agents. In this paper, we provide a systematic study of efficient risk sharing in markets where allocations are constrained to be counter-monotonic. The preferences of the agents are modelled by a common distortion risk measure, or equivalently, by a common Yaari dual utility. We consider three different settings: risk-averse agents, risk-seeking agents, and those with an inverse S-shaped distortion function. In each case, we provide useful characterizations of optimal allocations, for both the counter-monotonic market and the unconstrained market. To illustrate our results, we consider an application to a portfolio choice problem for a portfolio manager tasked with managing the investments of a group of clients, with varying levels of risk aversion or risk seeking. We determine explicitly the optimal investment strategies in this case. Our results confirm the intuition that a manager investing on behalf of risk-seeking agents tends to invest more in risky assets than a manager acting on behalf of risk-averse agents.</description>

      <title>On Deep Learning for computing the Dynamic Initial Margin and Margin Value Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work addresses the challenge of training neural networks for Dynamic Initial Margin (DIM) computation in counterparty credit risk, a task traditionally burdened by the high costs associated with generating training datasets through nested Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. By condensing the initial market state variables into an input vector, determined through an interest rate model and a parsimonious parameterization of the current interest rate term structure, we construct a training dataset where labels are noisy but unbiased DIM samples derived from single MC paths. A multi-output neural network structure is employed to handle DIM as a time-dependent function, facilitating training across a mesh of monitoring times. The methodology offers significant advantages: it reduces the dataset generation cost to a single MC execution and parameterizes the neural network by initial market state variables, obviating the need for repeated training. Experimental results demonstrate the approach's convergence properties and robustness across different interest rate models (Vasicek and Hull-White) and portfolio complexities, validating its general applicability and efficiency in more realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Rank-Dependent Theory for Decision under Risk and Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper axiomatizes, in a two-stage setup, a new theory for decision under risk and ambiguity. The axiomatized preference relation $\succeq$ on the space $\tilde{V}$ of random variables induces an ambiguity index $c$ on the space $\Delta$ of probabilities, a probability weighting function $\psi$, generating the measure $\nu_{\psi}$ by transforming an objective probability measure, and a utility function $\phi$, such that, for all $\tilde{v},\tilde{u}\in\tilde{V}$, \begin{align*} \tilde{v}\succeq\tilde{u} \Leftrightarrow \min_{Q \in \Delta} \left\{\mathbb{E}_Q\left[\int\phi\left(\tilde{v}^{\centerdot}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\nu_{\psi}\right]+c(Q)\right\} \geq \min_{Q \in \Delta} \left\{\mathbb{E}_Q\left[\int\phi\left(\tilde{u}^{\centerdot}\right)\,\mathrm{d}\nu_{\psi}\right]+c(Q)\right\}. \end{align*} Our theory extends the rank-dependent utility model of Quiggin (1982) for decision under risk to risk and ambiguity, reduces to the variational preferences model when $\psi$ is the identity, and is dual to variational preferences when $\phi$ is affine in the same way as the theory of Yaari (1987) is dual to expected utility. As a special case, we obtain a preference axiomatization of a decision theory that is a rank-dependent generalization of the popular maxmin expected utility theory. We characterize ambiguity aversion in our theory.</description>

      <title>A new paradigm of mortality modeling via individual vitality dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of mortality modeling extends across multiple research areas, including life insurance valuation, longevity risk management, life-cycle hypothesis, and retirement income planning. Despite the variety of existing approaches, such as mortality laws and factor-based models, they often lack compatibility or fail to meet specific research needs. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel approach centered on modeling the dynamics of individual vitality and defining mortality as the depletion of vitality level to zero. More specifically, we develop a four-component framework to analyze the initial value, trend, diffusion, and sudden changes in vitality level over an individual's lifetime. We demonstrate the framework's estimation and analytical capabilities in various settings and discuss its practical implications in actuarial problems and other research areas. The broad applicability and interpretability of our vitality-based modeling approach offer an enhanced paradigm for mortality modeling.</description>
