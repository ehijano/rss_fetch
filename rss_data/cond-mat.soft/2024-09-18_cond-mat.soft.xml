      <title>Excess entropy of strongly coupled Yukawa fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entropy of strongly coupled Yukawa fluids is discussed from several perspectives. First, it is demonstrated that a vibrational paradigm of atomic dynamics in dense fluids can be used to obtain a simple and accurate estimate of the entropy without any adjustable parameters. Second, it is explained why a quasiuniversal value of the excess entropy of simple fluids at the freezing point should be expected, and it is demonstrated that a remaining very weak dependence of the freezing point entropy on the screening parameter in the Yukawa fluid can be described by a simple linear function. Third, a scaling of the excess entropy with the freezing temperature is examined, a modified form of the Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling is put forward, and some consequences are briefly discussed. Fourth, the location of the Frenkel line on the phase diagram of Yukawa systems is discussed in terms of the excess entropy and compared with some predictions made in the literature. Fifth, the excess entropy scaling of the transport coefficients (self-diffusion, viscosity, and thermal conductivity) is reexamined using the contemporary datasets for the transport properties of Yukawa fluids. The results could be of particular interest in the context of complex (dusty) plasmas, colloidal suspensions, electrolytes, and other related systems with soft pairwise interactions.</description>

      <title>Sticking without contact: Elastohydrodynamic adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adhesion between dry solid surfaces is typically governed by contact forces, involving surface forces and elasticity. For surfaces immersed in a fluid, out-of-contact adhesion arises due to the viscous resistance to the opening of the liquid gap. While the adhesion between dry solids is described by the classical JKR theory, there is no equivalent framework for the wet adhesion of soft solids. Here, we investigate theoretically the viscous adhesion emerging during the separation of a sphere from an elastic substrate. The suction pressure within the thin viscous film between the solids induces significant elastic displacements. Unexpectedly, the elastic substrate closely follows the motion of the sphere, leading to a sticking without contact. The initial dynamics is described using similarity solutions, resulting in a nonlinear adhesion force that grows in time as F ~ t^(2/3). When elastic displacements become large enough, another similarity solution emerges that leads to a violent snap-off of the adhesive contact through a finite-time singularity. The observed phenomenology bears a strong resemblance with JKR theory, and is relevant for a wide range of applications involving viscous adhesion.</description>

      <title>Universality of the close packing properties and markers of isotropic-to-tetratic phase change in quasi-one-dimensional superdisk fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equilibrium states and phases of a quasi-one-dimensional system of hard superdisks (anisotropic particles interpolating between disks and squares) where the centers of the particles are constrained to move on a line. A continuous change from a quasi-isotropic to a tetratic phase is found upon increasing the density. Somewhat unexpected, for isobaric states, systems with larger and more anisotropic particles in the tetratic phase are denser than systems with smaller and less anisotropic particles in a quasi-isotropic phase. Close packing behaviour is characterised by exponents describing the behaviour of the pressure, the angular fluctuations and the angular correlation length. We obtain two universal, shape-independent relations between them.</description>

      <title>Disordered Yet Directed: The Emergence of Polar Flocks with Disordered Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flocking is a prime example of how robust collective behavior can emerge from simple interaction rules. The flocking transition has been studied extensively since the inception of the original Vicsek model. Here, we introduce a novel self-propelled particle model with quenched disorder in the pairwise alignment interaction couplings akin to a spin glass model. We show that the presence of quenched disorder can promote (rather than destroy) the emergence of global polar order. In particular, we show that our model can display a flocking phase even when the majority of the interaction couplings are anti-aligning. Activity is the key ingredient to reduce frustration in the system as it allows local particle clustering combined with self-organization of the particles to favor neighborhoods with strong cooperative interactions.</description>

      <title>Mechanical and thermodynamic routes to the liquid-liquid interfacial tension and mixing free energy by molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we carried out equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations of the liquid-liquid interface between two different Lennard-Jones components with varying miscibility, where we examined the relation between the interfacial tension and isolation free energy using both a mechanical and thermodynamic approach. Using the mechanical approach, we obtained a stress distribution around a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) EMD systems with a flat LL interface. From the stress distribution, we calculated the liquid-liquid interfacial tension based on Bakker's equation, which uses the stress anisotropy around the interface, and measures how it varies with miscibility. The second approach uses thermodynamic integration by enforcing quasi-static isolation of the two liquids to calculate the free energy. This uses the same EMD systems as the mechanical approach, with both extended dry-surface and phantom-wall (PW) schemes applied. When the two components were immiscible, the interfacial tension and isolation free energy were in good agreement, provided all kinetic and interaction contributions were included in the stress. When the components were miscible, the values were significantly different. From the result of PW for the case of completely mixed liquids, the difference was attributed to the additional free energy required to separate the binary mixture into single components against the osmotic pressure prior to the complete detachment of the two components, i.e., the free energy of mixing.</description>

      <title>Dispersive wave propagation in disordered flexible fibers enhances stress attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally and computationally analyze impact-shock-induced stress wave propagation in packings of disordered flexible fibers. We find that dispersive wave propagation, associated with large stress attenuation, occurs much more prevalently in systems with larger fiber aspect ratios and moderate fiber flexibility. We trace these features to the microstructural properties of fiber contact chains and the energy-trapping abilities of deformable fibers. These findings provide new insights into physics of the shock-impacted flexible fiber packings and open the way towards an improved granular-material-based damping technology.</description>

      <title>Mapping self-avoiding walk on obstacle-ridden lattice onto chelation of heavy metal ions: Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-avoiding walk (SAW) represents linear polymer chain on a large scale, neglecting its chemical details and emphasizing the role of its conformational statistics. The role of the latter is important in formation of agglomerates and complexes involving polymers and organic or inorganic particles, such as polymer-stabilized colloidal suspensions, microemulsions, or micellar solutions. When such particles can be adsorbed on a polymer of considerably larger dimensions than themselves, this setup may represent chelation of heavy metal ions by polymeric chelants. We consider the SAW of the length $N$ on a cubic lattice ridden by randomly distributed obstacles of the concentration $p$ interpreted as ions. The SAW monomers can bind to the obstacles with variable binding energy $\varepsilon$ mimicking formation of the chelation bond. Pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm is applied to simulate system behaviour. We focus on several relevant properties related to the chelation efficiency and strength, as functions of the variables set $\{p,N,\varepsilon\}$. The results are interpreted in terms of conformational freedom, excluded volume effects and loop formation for the SAW, and the tendencies being predicted are in agreement with some experimental data.</description>

      <title>Length scales in electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elusive presence of an anomalously increasing screening length at high ionic concentrations hampers a complete picture of interactions in electrolytes. Theories which extend the diluted Debye-Huckel framework to higher concentrations predict, in addition to the expected decreasing Debye length, an increasing significant scale of the order of at most a few ionic diameters. More recent surface force balance experiments with different materials succeeded in measuring increasing length scales which, however, turn out to extend over tenths or even hundreds of ionic diameters. While simulation work has managed to characterize the former, the latter still avoid detection, generating doubts about its true origin. Here we provide a step forward in the clarification of such a conundrum. We have studied by extensive Molecular Dynamics simulation the properties of a generic model of electrolyte, lithium tetrafluoroborate dissolved in ethylene-carbonate, in a vast range of salt concentrations continuously joining the Debye non-interacting limit to the opposite over-charged ionic liquid-like states. On one side, we have accurately determined the macroscopic concentration-induced structural, dielectric and transport modifications, on the other we have quantified the resulting nano-scale ions organization. Based only on the simulation data, without resorting to any uncontrolled hypothesis or phenomenological parameter, we identify a convincing candidate for the measured anomalously increasing length, whose origin has been possibly misinterpreted.</description>

      <title>Influence of media disorder on DNA melting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the fractal form of the compact chromatin in vivo, we study the melting of a lattice DNA on the infinite cluster backbone near the three-dimensional site percolation critical point $(p_c=0.3116)$, which exhibits fractal-like properties, using Monte Carlo simulations. Further, we extend our study to other values of atmospheric disorder $(p_c\leq p \leq 1)$ and show how the melting temperature varies with a decrease in the availability of lattice sites mimicking the crowded environment inside the cell nucleus. Importantly, we found that the melting transition sharpens with a linear increase in the denaturation temperature as we increase the degree of disorder. Two separate disorder regimes showing weak and strong effects on melting can be identified. For simulations, we use the pruned and enriched Rosenbluth method in conjunction with a depth-first implementation of the Leath algorithm to generate the underlying disorder.</description>

      <title>Topology mediated organization of E.coli chromosome in fast growth conditions</title>

Abstract: Recent experiments have been able to visualise chromosome organization in fast-growing E.coli cells. However, the mechanism underlying the spatio-temporal organization remains poorly understood. We propose that the DNA adopts a specific polymer topology as it goes through its cell cycle. We establish that the emergent entropic forces between polymer segments of the DNA-polymer with modified topology, leads to chromosome organization as seen in-vivo. We employ computer simulations of a replicating bead spring model of a polymer in a cylinder to investigate the problem. Our simulation of the overlapping cell cycles not only show successful segregation, but also reproduces the evolution of the spatial organization of the chromosomes as observed in experiments. This manuscript in addition to our previous work on slowly growing bacterial cells, shows that our topology-based model can explain the organization of chromosomes in all growth conditions.</description>

      <title>Deformation Dynamics of Nanopores upon Water Imbibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capillarity-driven transport in nanoporous solids is widespread in nature and crucial for modern liquid-infused engineering materials. During imbibition, curved menisci driven by high negative Laplace pressures exert an enormous contractile load on the porous matrix. Due to the challenge of simultaneously monitoring imbibition and deformation with high spatial resolution, the resulting coupling of solid elasticity to liquid capillarity has remained largely unexplored. Here, we study water imbibition in mesoporous silica using optical imaging, gravimetry, and high-resolution dilatometry. In contrast to an expected Laplace pressure-induced contraction, we find a square-root-of-time expansion and an additional abrupt length increase when the menisci reach the top surface. The final expansion is absent when we stop the imbibition front inside the porous medium in a dynamic imbibition-evaporation equilibrium, as is typical for transpiration-driven hydraulic transport in plants, especially in trees. These peculiar deformation behaviors are validated by single-nanopore molecular dynamics simulations and described by a continuum model that highlights the importance of expansive surface stresses at the pore walls (Bangham effect) and the buildup or release of contractile Laplace pressures as menisci collectively advance, arrest, or disappear. Our model suggests that these observations apply to any imbibition process in nanopores, regardless of the liquid/solid combination, and that the Laplace contribution upon imbibition is precisely half that of vapor sorption, due to the linear pressure drop associated with viscous flow. Thus, simple deformation measurements can be used to quantify surface stresses and Laplace pressures or transport in a wide variety of natural and artificial porous media.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic swelling due to hydration constrains anisotropic elasticity in biomaterial fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Naturally occurring protein fibers often undergo anisotropic swelling when hydrated. Within a tendon, a hydrated collagen fibril's radius expands by 40% but its length only increases by 5%. The same effect, with a similar relative magnitude, is observed for single hair shafts. Fiber hydration is known to affect elastic properties. Here we show that anisotropic swelling constrains the anisotropic linear elastic properties of fibers. First we show, using data from disparate previously reported studies, that anisotropic swelling can be described as an approximately linear function of water content. Then, under the observation that the elastic energy of swelling can be minimized by the anisotropic shape, we relate swelling anisotropy to elastic anisotropy -- assuming radial (transverse) symmetry within a cylindrical geometry. We find an upper bound for the commonly measured axial Poisson ratio $\nu_{zx}&lt;1/2$. This is significantly below recently estimated values for collagen fibrils extracted from tissue-level measurements, but is consistent with both single hair shaft and single collagen fibril mechanical and hydration studies. Using $\nu_{zx}$, we can then constrain the product $\gamma \equiv (1-\nu_{xy}) E_z/E_x$ -- where $\nu_{xy}$ is the seldom measured transverse Poisson ratio and $E_z/E_x$ is the ratio of axial to radial Young's moduli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of double-stranded DNA or RNA to locally melt and form kinks leads to strong non-linear elasticity effects that qualitatively affect their packing in confined spaces. Using analytical theory and numerical simulation we show that kink formation entails a mixed spool-nematic ordering of double-stranded DNA or RNA in spherical capsids, consisting of an outer spool domain and an inner, twisted nematic domain. These findings explain the experimentally observed nematic domains in viral capsids and imply that non-linear elasticity must be considered to predict the configurations and dynamics of double-stranded genomes in viruses, bacterial nucleoids or gene-delivery vehicles. The non-linear elastic theory suggests that spool-nematic ordering is a general feature of strongly confined kinkable polymers.</description>

      <title>Nematic Torques in Scalar Active Matter: when Fluctuations Favor Polar Order and Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of nematic alignment on scalar active matter in the disordered phase. We show that nematic torques control the emergent physics of particles interacting via pairwise forces and can either induce or prevent phase separation. The underlying mechanism is a fluctuation-induced renormalization of the mass of the polar field that generically arises from nematic torques. The correlations between the fluctuations of the polar and nematic fields indeed conspire to increase the particle persistence length, contrary to what phenomenological computations predict. This effect is generic and our theory also quantitatively accounts for how nematic torques enhance particle accumulation along confining boundaries and opposes demixing in mixtures of active and passive particles.</description>

Abstract: The low elastic modulus of soft materials, combined with geometric nonlinearity and rate dependence, presents significant challenges in the characterization of their mechanical response. We introduce a novel method for measuring the mechanical properties of soft materials under large deformations via cylindrical cavity expansion. In this method, a cylindrical cavity is fabricated in the material and expanded by volume-controlled injection of an incompressible fluid with simultaneous measurement of the applied pressure at the cavity wall. The relationship between applied pressure and deformation at the cavity wall is then employed to characterize the nonlinear mechanical properties. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method and validate it by measuring the mechanical properties of synthetic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and comparing with reported values in the literature. Results indicate that the cylindrical cavitation method effectively captures the response of PDMS over a wide range of stiffness (shear modulus ranging from 5 kPa to 300 kPa) and exhibit high repeatability. The proposed method overcomes limitations in characterization of ultra-soft materials using traditional testing methods, such as challenges with fabrication and clamping in unaxial tension testing and friction and adhesion effects in compression and indentation testing, thus enabling accurate and precise characterization. It also offers improved accuracy and repeatability over other needle induced cavity expansion methods due to precise control over the initial cavity dimension and shape at the cost of increased invasiveness of testing.</description>
