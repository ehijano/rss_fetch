      <title>Field Aligned Currents and Aurora During the Terrestrial Alfven Wing State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When sub-Alfvenic (Alfven Mach number M_A &lt; 1) plasmas impact Earth, the magnetosphere develops Alfven wings. A Multiscale Atmosphere Geospace Environment (MAGE) global simulation of the April 2023 geomagnetic storm, validated against Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE), reveals the mechanism of field-aligned current (FAC) generation and resulting aurora for the terrestrial Alfven wings. Simulation and observations show northern hemisphere planetward flowing auroral electrons (negative FAC) are dominantly at magnetic local times (MLTs) 5-11. Just before the wings formed, solar wind conditions were similar and 1 &lt; M_A &lt; 2, yet negative FAC extended across the entire day-side and night-side dusk sectors. Flow vorticity drives FACs at the boundary of the Alfven wings and unshocked solar wind. The Alfven wing shape presents a different obstacle to the solar wind compared to typical lobe fluxes, producing the unique FAC and auroral patterns. New insights about Alfven wing FACs will generate new understanding of aurora for exoplanets inside their host star's Alfven zone.</description>

      <title>Impact of Stochastic Acceleration on the Pickup Proton Distribution and ENA Fluxes in the Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes a kinetic model of pickup proton distribution in the heliosphere that considers the process of stochastic acceleration by the small-scale Alfvenic and large-scale magnetosonic fluctuations. Using this model, we investigated the impact of this process on the velocity distribution function of pickup protons. The model results showed that stochastic acceleration leads to diffusion in the velocity space and the formation of a high-velocity ``tail'' in the distribution function of pickup protons. We also simulated the energy spectra of energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes from the inner heliosheath and compared them to the observations of IBEX-Lo/Hi instruments onboard the IBEX spacecraft in Earth's orbit. The comparison showed that (a) consideration of the large-scale oscillations of the solar wind velocity allows for explaining the IBEX-Hi observations at the highest energy steps, and (b) the velocity diffusion is responsible for an ENA flux increase in the 0.1 -- 0.5 keV range, partially reconciling existing discrepancies between IBEX-Lo observations and models that do not consider this process.</description>

      <title>Arecibo Multi-frequency IPS Observations: Solar Wind Density Turbulence Scale Sizes and their Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations conducted with the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope during the minimum phase at the end of solar cycle 24 and the onset of solar cycle 25. These observations span a broad frequency range of ~300 to 3100 MHz, encompassing the P-, L-, and S-bands, and covered heliocentric distances from ~5 to 200 solar radii. The dynamic spectrum of the scintillations obtained at L-band shows a systematic decrease in the scintillation index from the lowest to the highest frequency, offering valuable insight into the influence of the solar wind density microstructures responsible for scintillation. Analyses of the scintillation index ($m$) for multiple sources at L-band, along with near-simultaneous observations of selected sources covering the P-, L-, and S-bands, clearly demonstrate a wavelength dependence of $m \propto \lambda^\omega$, which inherently leads to a dependence of $m$ on the Fresnel scale, when considering the effective distance to the scattering screen, $z$. The index $\omega$ ranges between $\sim$1 and 1.8. The average $\omega$ value of a source, determined from observations made on different days, exhibits variability across sources. The results on the radial dependence of scintillation agree with earlier IPS measurements. The temporal power spectra obtained over the wide frequency range exhibit a power-level evolution in accordance with the wavelength dependence, and a broadening with increasing observation frequency. Furthermore, the increased temporal-frequency rounding of the `Fresnel knee' in the spectrum with the observing frequency suggests a novel phenomenon: an increase in anisotropy as the scale size of the density-turbulence structure decreases.</description>

      <title>Resolving spatial and temporal shock structures using LOFAR observations of type II radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are one of the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. In the heliosphere, type II solar radio bursts are signatures of electrons accelerated by collisionless shocks launched at the Sun. Spectral observations of these bursts show a variety of fine structures often composing multiple type II lanes. The origin of these lanes and structures is not well understood and has been attributed to the inhomogeneous environment around the propagating shock. Here, we aim to determine the large-scale local structures near a coronal shock wave using high-resolution radio imaging observations of a complex type II radio burst observed on 3 October 2023. By using inteferometric imaging from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), combined with extreme ultraviolet observations, we investigate the origin of multiple type II lanes at low frequencies (30--80~MHz) relative to the propagating shock wave. We identify at least three radio sources at metric wavelengths corresponding to a multi-lane type II burst. The type II burst sources propagate outwards with a shock driven by a coronal mass ejection. We find a double radio source that exhibits increasing separation over time, consistent with the expansion rate of the global coronal shock. This suggests that the overall shock expansion is nearly self-similar, with acceleration hotspots forming at various times and splitting at a rate proportional to the shock's expansion. Our results show the importance of increased spatial resolution in determining either the small-scale spatial properties in coronal shocks or the structuring of the ambient medium. Possible shock corrugations or structuring of the upstream plasma at the scale of 10$^5$~km can act as hotspots for the acceleration of suprathermal electrons.</description>

      <title>An experimental platform for levitated mechanics in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>

      <title>What defines stationarity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the concept of entropy defect in thermodynamics, we construct the entropy formulation of space plasmas, and then use it to develop a measure of their stationarity. In particular, we show that statistics of this entropy results in two findings that improve our understanding of stationary and nonstationary systems: (i) variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy do not exceed twice the value of the thermodynamic kappa, the parameter that provides a measure of the entropy defect in both stationary and nonstationary states, while becomes the shape parameter that labels the kappa distributions in stationary states; and (ii) the ratio of the deviation of the BG entropy with kappa scales with the kappa deviation via a power-law, while the respective exponent provides a stationarity deviation index (SDI), which measures the natural tendency of the system to depart from stationarity. We confirm the validity of these findings in three different heliospheric plasma datasets observed from three missions: (1) A solar energetic particle event, recorded by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument onboard Parker Solar Probe; (2) Near Earth solar wind protons recorded by the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard WIND; and (3) Plasma protons in the heliosheath, source of energetic neutral atoms recorded by IBEX. The full strength and capability of the entropic deviation ratio and SDI can now be used by the space physics community for analyzing and characterizing the stationarity of space plasmas, as well as other researchers for analyzing any other correlated systems.</description>
