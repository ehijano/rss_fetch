      <title>Homotopy, homology, and persistent homology using closure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.10206v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop persistent homology in the setting of filtrations of (Cech) closure spaces. Examples of filtrations of closure spaces include metric spaces, weighted graphs, weighted directed graphs, and filtrations of topological spaces. We use various products and intervals for closure spaces to obtain six homotopy theories, six cubical singular homology theories, and three simplicial singular homology theories. Applied to filtrations of closure spaces, these homology theories produce persistence modules. We extend the definition of Gromov-Hausdorff distance from metric spaces to filtrations of closure spaces and use it to prove that any persistence module obtained from a homotopy-invariant functor on closure spaces is stable.</description>

      <title>Surfaces and other Peano Continua with no Generic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The space of chains on a compact connected space encodes all the different ways of continuously growing out of a point until exhausting the space. A chain is generic if its orbit under the action of the underlying homeomorphism group is comeager. In this paper we show that a large family of topological spaces do not have a generic chain: in addition to all manifolds of dimension at least 3, for which the result was already known, our theorem covers all compact surfaces except for the sphere and the real projective plane - for which the question remains open - as well as all other homogeneous Peano continua, circle excluded. If the spaces are moreover strongly locally homogeneous, which is the case for any closed manifold and the Menger curve, we prove that chains cannot be classified up to homeomorphism by countable structures, and that the underlying homomorphism groups have non-metrizable universal minimal flows, in contrast to the case of 1-dimensional manifolds. The proof of the main result is of combinatorial nature, and it relies on the creation of a dictionary between open sets of chains on one side, and walks on finite connected graphs on the other.</description>
