      <title>Uniqueness of Equilibrium Measure for a Family of Partially Hyperbolic Horseshoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the uniqueness of equilibrium state for a family of partially hyperbolic horseshoes, introduced in [12] for some classes of continuous potentials. For the first class, the method used here is making use of the Sarig's theory for countable shifts. For this purpose, we study the dynamics of an induced map associated to the horseshoe map, we build a symbolic system with infinitely many symbols that is topologically conjugated to this induced map and we show that the induced potential is locally H\"{o}lder and recurrent. For the second class, by following ideas of [29] and [31], we prove that uniqueness for the horseshoe is equivalent to uniqueness for the restriction to a non-uniformly expanding map, which is a hyperbolic potential and then has uniqueness. Both classes include potentials with high variation, differently from previous results for potentials with low variation. We also prove uniqueness when the potential presents its supremum at a special fixed point and less than the pressure.</description>

      <title>Directional Expansiveness for Rd-Actions and for Penrose Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study two kinds of directional expansiveness, weak and strong, for an action T of \mathbb{R}^d on a compact metric space X. We show that for \mathbb{R}^2 finite local complexity (FLC) tiling dynamical systems, weak and strong expansiveness are the same, and are both equivalent to a simple coding property. Then we show for the Penrose tiling dynamical system, which is FLC, there are exactly five non expansive directions, the directions perpendicular to the 5th roots of unity. We also study Raphael Robinson's set of 24 Penrose Wang tiles and show the corresponding Penrose Wang tile dynamical system is strictly ergodic. Finally, we study two deformations of the Penrose Wang tile system, one where the square Wang tiles are all deformed into a 2\pi/5 rhombus, and another where they are deformed into a set of eleven tetragon tiles. We show both of these are topologically conjugate to the Penrose tiling dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Infinite topological entropy, positive mean dimension, and factors of subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamical systems with the property that all the nontrivial factors have infinite topological entropy (or, positive mean dimension). We establish an ``if and only if'' condition for this property among a typical class of dynamical systems, the subshifts of block type in the Hilbert cube. This in particular leads to a large class of concrete (and new) examples of dynamical systems having this property.</description>

      <title>Avoshifts, Unishifts and Nondeterministic Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study avoshifts and unishifts on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Avoshifts are subshifts where for each convex set $C$, and each vector $v$ such that $C \cup \{\vec v\}$ is also convex, the set of valid extensions of globally valid patterns on $C$ to ones on $C \cup \{v\}$ is determined by a bounded subpattern of $C$. Unishifts are the subshifts where for such $C, \vec v$, every $C$-pattern has the same number of $\vec v$-extensions. Cellwise quasigroup shifts (including group shifts) and TEP subshifts are examples of unishifts, while unishifts and subshifts with topological strong spatial mixing are examples of avoshifts. We prove that every avoshift is the spacetime subshift of a nondeterministic cellular automaton on an avoshift of lower dimension up to a linear transformation and a convex blocking. From this, we deduce that all avoshifts contain periodic points, and that unishifts have dense periodic points and admit equal entropy full shift factors.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of the boundaries of attracting basins of entire maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dimension of the boundaries of periodic Fatou components of transcendental entire maps. We prove that if $U$ is an immediate component of the basin of an attracting periodic point $\zeta$ of period $p\ge 1$ of a transcendental entire function $f\colon \mathbb C \to \mathbb C$ from the Eremenko--Lyubich class $\mathcal B$, such that $\text{deg} f^p|_U = \infty$ and $\overline{\text{Sing}(f^p|_U)}$ is a compact subset of $U$, then the hyperbolic (and, consequently, Hausdorff) dimension of the boundary of $U$ is larger than $1$. The same holds if $U$ is an immediate component of the basin of a parabolic $p$-periodic point $\zeta$, under an additional assumption $\zeta \notin \overline{\text{Sing}(f^p)}$. We also show that if $U$ is a bounded immediate component of an attracting basin of a transcendental entire function $f$, then the hyperbolic dimension of the boundary of $U$ is larger than $1$. In particular, this implies that the boundary of a component of an attracting basin of a transcendental entire function is never a smooth or rectifiable curve.</description>

      <title>A problem of Hirst for the Hurwitz continued fraction and the Hausdorff dimension of sets with restricted slowly growing digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of determining the Hausdorff dimension of sets consisting of complex irrationals whose complex continued fraction digits satisfy prescribed restrictions and growth conditions. For the Hurwitz continued fraction, we confirm Hirst's conjecture, as a complex analogue of the result of Wang and Wu [Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. {\bf 40} (2008), no. 1, 18--22] for the regular continued fraction. We also prove a complex analogue of the second-named author's result on the Hausdorff dimension of sets with restricted slowly growing digits [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. {\bf 151} (2023), no. 9, 3645--3653]. To these ends, we exploit an infinite conformal iterated function system associated with the Hurwitz continued fraction.</description>

      <title>Dimension preserving set-valued approximation and decomposition via metric sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, the Minkowski-sum and the metric-sum of compact sets are highlighted. While the first is associative, the latter is not. But the major drawback of the Minkowski combination is that, by increasing the number of summands, this leads to convexification. The present article is uncovered in two folds: The initial segment presents a novel approach to approximate a continuous set-valued function with compact images via a fractal approach using the metric linear combination of sets. The other segment contains the dimension analysis of the distance set of graph of set-valued function and solving the celebrated distance set conjecture. In the end, a decomposition of any continuous convex compact set-valued function is exhibited that preserves the Hausdorff dimension, so this will serve as a method for dealing with complicated set-valued functions.</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $d\geq2$, we construct a Zariski-dense random walk on the space of lattices SL$_d(\mathbb{R})/$SL$_d(\mathbb{Z})$ that exhibits escape of mass. This negates the suggestion of recurrence made by Benoist [Ben14] (ICM 2014) and by B\'enard-de Saxc\'e [BS22] (also asked in [BQ12]). For any $p \in (0,1)$, we also construct such a random walk with finite $L^p$-moment which shows that the moment assumption in [BS22] is sharp.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of the Invariant Measure of the Strange Attractor of the Bacteria Mathematical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bacteria metabolic process of open nonlinear dissipative system far from equilibrium point is modeled using classical methods of synergetics. The invariant measure and its convergence in the phase space of the system was obtained in strange attractor mode. The distribution of point density of trajectory intersection of phase space cells with maximum invariant measure and convergence in time of its average value was obtained. The result concluded is that the value of an invariant measure can be a characteristic of the transitional process of adaptation of cell metabolic process to change outside environment.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we use the Maslov index to obtain a lower bound on the number of unstable eigenvalues associated with standing pulse solutions in skew-gradient systems. Based on this, we establish an instability criterion for the standing pulse. As an application, the results are applied to FitzHugh-Nagumo type systems, in which the activator and inhibitor reaction terms exhibit inherent nonlinear structures.</description>

      <title>Williams' conjecture holds for graphs of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three is a connected finite essential graph such that its Leavitt path algebra has Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three. We provide number-theoretic criteria for graphs of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three to be strong shift equivalent. We then prove that two graphs of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three are shift equivalent if and only if they are strongly shift equivalent, if and only if their corresponding Leavitt path algebras are graded Morita equivalent, if and only if their graded $K$-theories, $K^{\text{gr}}_0$, are order-preserving $\mathbb{Z}[x, x^{-1}]$-module isomorphic. As a consequence, we obtain that the Leavitt path algebras of graphs of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three are graded Morita equivalent if and only if their graph $C^*$-algebras are equivariant Morita equivalent, and two graphs $E$ and $F$ of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three are shift equivalent if and only if the singularity categories $\text{D}_{\text{sg}}(KE/J_E^2)$ and $\text{D}_{\text{sg}}(KF/J_F^2)$ are triangulated equivalent.</description>

      <title>Beyond Boolean networks: new tools for the steady state analysis of multivalued networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boolean networks can be viewed as functions on the set of binary strings of a given length, described via logical rules. They were introduced as dynamic models into biology, in particular as logical models of intracellular regulatory networks involving genes, proteins, and metabolites. Since genes can have several modes of action depending on their expression levels, binary variables are often not sufficiently rich, requiring the use of multivalued networks instead.
  In this paper, we explore the multivalued generalization of Boolean networks by writing the standard $(\wedge, \vee, \lnot)$ operations on $\{0, 1\}$ in terms of the operations $(\odot, \oplus, \neg)$ on $\big\{0,\frac{1}{m}, \frac{2}{m}, \dots, \frac{m-1}{m}, 1\big\}$ from multivalued logic. We recall the basic theory of this mathematical framework, and give a novel algorithm for computing the fixed points that in many cases has essentially the same complexity as in the binary case. Our approach provides a biologically intuitive representation of the network. Furthermore, it uses tools to compute lattice points in rational polytopes, tapping a rich area of algebraic combinatorics as a source for combinatorial algorithms for network analysis. An implementation of the algorithm is provided.</description>

      <title>Dynamically syndetic sets and the combinatorics of syndetic, idempotent filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset of the positive integers is dynamically central syndetic if it contains the set of times that a point returns to a neighborhood of itself under a minimal transformation of a compact metric space. These sets are part of the highly-influential link between dynamics and combinatorics forged by Furstenberg and Weiss in the 1970's. Our main result is a characterization of dynamically central syndetic sets as precisely those sets that belong to syndetic, idempotent filters. Idempotent filters are combinatorial objects that abound in ergodic Ramsey theory but have been largely unnoticed and unexplored. We develop the algebra of these objects for the proof of the main theorem and with an eye toward future applications.
  The main result is best contextualized as a "global" analogue to the "local" characterization of Furstenberg's central sets as members of minimal, idempotent ultrafilters. It leads to a dual characterization of sets of topological pointwise recurrence, allowing us to answer a question of Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. We draw numerous striking contrasts between pointwise recurrence and set recurrence, a topic with a long history in the subject and its applications, and answer four questions posed by Host, Kra, and Maass. We also show that the intersection of a dynamically central syndetic set with a set of pointwise recurrence must be piecewise syndetic, generalizing results of Dong, Glasner, Huang, Shao, Weiss, and Ye.</description>

      <title>On the Destruction of Invariant Lagrangian Graphs for Conformal Symplectic Twist Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the fragility of invariant Lagrangian graphs for dissipative maps, focusing on their destruction under small perturbations. Inspired by Herman's work on conservative systems, we prove that all $C^0$-invariant Lagrangian graphs for an integrable dissipative twist maps can be destroyed by perturbations that are arbitrarily small in the $C^{1-\varepsilon}$-topology. This result is sharp, as evidenced by the persistence of $C^1$-invariant graphs under $C^1$-perturbations guaranteed by the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold theorem.</description>

      <title>Arnold Diffusion in the Full Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of Arnold diffusion in the planar full three-body problem, which is expressed as a perturbation of a Kepler problem and a planar circular restricted three-body problem, with the perturbation parameter being the mass of the smallest body. In this context, we obtain Arnold diffusion in terms of a transfer of energy, in an amount independent of the perturbation parameter, between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on a topological method based on correctly aligned windows which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. This approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, such as those in a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</description>

      <title>Accuracy versus Predominance: Reassessing the validity of the quasi-steady-state approximation</title>

Abstract: The application of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation to the Michaelis--Menten reaction mechanism is a textbook example of biochemical model reduction, derived using singular perturbation theory. However, determining the specific biochemical conditions that dictate the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation remains a challenging endeavor. Emerging research suggests that the accuracy of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation improves as the ratio of the initial enzyme concentration, $e_0$, to the Michaelis constant, $K_M$, decreases. In this work, we examine this ratio and its implications for the accuracy and validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation as compared to other quasi-steady-state reductions in its proximity. Using standard tools from the analysis of ordinary differential equations, we show that while $e_0/K_M$ provides an indication of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's asymptotic accuracy, the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's predominance relies on a small ratio of $e_0$ to the Van Slyke-Cullen constant, $K$. Here, we define the predominance of a quasi-steady-state reduction when it offers the highest approximation accuracy among other well-known reductions with overlapping validity conditions. We conclude that the magnitude of $e_0/K$ offers the most accurate measure of the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation.</description>

      <title>Tractable Characterization of Discrete-Time Periodic Monotonicity Preserving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies three classes of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems, which differ by the set of periodic signals that they leave invariant. The first class preserves the property of periodic monotonicity, i.e., period-wise unimodality. The second class is invariant to signals with at most two sign changes per period, and the third class results from the second by additionally requiring that periodic signals with zero sign-changes are mapped to the same kind. We provide tractable characterizations for each system class by the use and extension of total positivity theory and combination with its geometric interpretations. In particular, central to our results is the characterization of sequentially convex contours.
  Moreover, as many static non-linearities, e.g., ideal relay, saturation, sigmoid function, quantizer, etc. also preserve these signal sets, our invariance characterizations also apply to the loop gain of Lur'e feedback systems. Thus, potentially forming the base for new developments of signal-based fixed-point theorems towards the prediction of self-sustained oscillations. In particular, our examples provide first indications for how the property of periodic monotonicity preservation is valuable to the study of relay feedback systems.</description>
