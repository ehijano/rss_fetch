      <title>Simulation of Gaussian Wave Packets used to Illustrate Elementary Quantum Mechanics Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we numerically solve the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation for scenarios using wave packets. These examples include the free wave packet, which we use to show the difference between group and phase velocities, the packet in a harmonic oscillator potential with non-trivial initial conditions in one and two dimensions, which is compared with their classical analogs to show how Ehrenfest theorem holds. We also include simulations of the diffraction through the single and double slit potentials, the refraction with a step potential and the dispersion by a central potential. The aim of this paper is to illustrate with simulations, nowadays easy to implement, scenarios that can help explaining the basics of the wave-particle duality.</description>

      <title>Quantum education in the frontier city of Kharkiv</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article provides the description of current training processes and structure of education in quantum physics at the Education and Research Institute "School of Physics and Technology" (SPT) of V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University, Ukraine. Crucial feature of quantum education at the SPT is the involvement of scientists and experts from national and international research centers who are actively working in the field. By taking example of particular quantum courses, we outline the main challenges in the educational process during the large-scale military aggression and the ways the lecturers, scientific employees, and students manage to overcome them. We also overview the recently emerged initiatives oriented on sustaining and development of quantum education in Kharkiv, as well as the international events with a broader impact. History of the School and its main achievements are provided in brief.</description>
