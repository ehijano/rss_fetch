      <title>3D Gaussian Blendshapes for Head Avatar Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce 3D Gaussian blendshapes for modeling photorealistic head avatars. Taking a monocular video as input, we learn a base head model of neutral expression, along with a group of expression blendshapes, each of which corresponds to a basis expression in classical parametric face models. Both the neutral model and expression blendshapes are represented as 3D Gaussians, which contain a few properties to depict the avatar appearance. The avatar model of an arbitrary expression can be effectively generated by combining the neutral model and expression blendshapes through linear blending of Gaussians with the expression coefficients. High-fidelity head avatar animations can be synthesized in real time using Gaussian splatting. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our Gaussian blendshape representation better captures high-frequency details exhibited in input video, and achieves superior rendering performance.</description>

      <title>Physical Non-inertial Poser (PNP): Modeling Non-inertial Effects in Sparse-inertial Human Motion Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing inertial motion capture techniques use the human root coordinate frame to estimate local poses and treat it as an inertial frame by default. We argue that when the root has linear acceleration or rotation, the root frame should be considered non-inertial theoretically. In this paper, we model the fictitious forces that are non-neglectable in a non-inertial frame by an auto-regressive estimator delicately designed following physics. With the fictitious forces, the force-related IMU measurement (accelerations) can be correctly compensated in the non-inertial frame and thus Newton's laws of motion are satisfied. In this case, the relationship between the accelerations and body motions is deterministic and learnable, and we train a neural network to model it for better motion capture. Furthermore, to train the neural network with synthetic data, we develop an IMU synthesis by simulation strategy to better model the noise model of IMU hardware and allow parameter tuning to fit different hardware. This strategy not only establishes the network training with synthetic data but also enables calibration error modeling to handle bad motion capture calibration, increasing the robustness of the system.

      <title>NeRF-Insert: 3D Local Editing with Multimodal Control Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose NeRF-Insert, a NeRF editing framework that allows users to make high-quality local edits with a flexible level of control. Unlike previous work that relied on image-to-image models, we cast scene editing as an in-painting problem, which encourages the global structure of the scene to be preserved. Moreover, while most existing methods use only textual prompts to condition edits, our framework accepts a combination of inputs of different modalities as reference. More precisely, a user may provide a combination of textual and visual inputs including images, CAD models, and binary image masks for specifying a 3D region. We use generic image generation models to in-paint the scene from multiple viewpoints, and lift the local edits to a 3D-consistent NeRF edit. Compared to previous methods, our results show better visual quality and also maintain stronger consistency with the original NeRF.</description>

      <title>Ultra Inertial Poser: Scalable Motion Capture and Tracking from Sparse Inertial Sensors and Ultra-Wideband Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While camera-based capture systems remain the gold standard for recording human motion, learning-based tracking systems based on sparse wearable sensors are gaining popularity. Most commonly, they use inertial sensors, whose propensity for drift and jitter have so far limited tracking accuracy. In this paper, we propose Ultra Inertial Poser, a novel 3D full body pose estimation method that constrains drift and jitter in inertial tracking via inter-sensor distances. We estimate these distances across sparse sensor setups using a lightweight embedded tracker that augments inexpensive off-the-shelf 6D inertial measurement units with ultra-wideband radio-based ranging$-$dynamically and without the need for stationary reference anchors. Our method then fuses these inter-sensor distances with the 3D states estimated from each sensor Our graph-based machine learning model processes the 3D states and distances to estimate a person's 3D full body pose and translation. To train our model, we synthesize inertial measurements and distance estimates from the motion capture database AMASS. For evaluation, we contribute a novel motion dataset of 10 participants who performed 25 motion types, captured by 6 wearable IMU+UWB trackers and an optical motion capture system, totaling 200 minutes of synchronized sensor data (UIP-DB). Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance for our method over PIP and TIP, reducing position error from $13.62$ to $10.65cm$ ($22\%$ better) and lowering jitter from $1.56$ to $0.055km/s^3$ (a reduction of $97\%$).</description>

      <title>Fake it to make it: Using synthetic data to remedy the data shortage in joint multimodal speech-and-gesture synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although humans engaged in face-to-face conversation simultaneously communicate both verbally and non-verbally, methods for joint and unified synthesis of speech audio and co-speech 3D gesture motion from text are a new and emerging field. These technologies hold great promise for more human-like, efficient, expressive, and robust synthetic communication, but are currently held back by the lack of suitably large datasets, as existing methods are trained on parallel data from all constituent modalities. Inspired by student-teacher methods, we propose a straightforward solution to the data shortage, by simply synthesising additional training material. Specifically, we use unimodal synthesis models trained on large datasets to create multimodal (but synthetic) parallel training data, and then pre-train a joint synthesis model on that material. In addition, we propose a new synthesis architecture that adds better and more controllable prosody modelling to the state-of-the-art method in the field. Our results confirm that pre-training on large amounts of synthetic data improves the quality of both the speech and the motion synthesised by the multimodal model, with the proposed architecture yielding further benefits when pre-trained on the synthetic data.

      <title>Lightplane: Highly-Scalable Components for Neural 3D Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary 3D research, particularly in reconstruction and generation, heavily relies on 2D images for inputs or supervision. However, current designs for these 2D-3D mapping are memory-intensive, posing a significant bottleneck for existing methods and hindering new applications. In response, we propose a pair of highly scalable components for 3D neural fields: Lightplane Render and Splatter, which significantly reduce memory usage in 2D-3D mapping. These innovations enable the processing of vastly more and higher resolution images with small memory and computational costs. We demonstrate their utility in various applications, from benefiting single-scene optimization with image-level losses to realizing a versatile pipeline for dramatically scaling 3D reconstruction and generation.

      <title>MetaStates: An Approach for Representing Human Workers' Psychophysiological States in the Industrial Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photo-realistic avatar is a modern term referring to the digital asset that represents a human in computer graphic advanced systems such as video games and simulation tools. These avatars utilize the advances in graphic technologies in both software and hardware aspects. While photo-realistic avatars are increasingly used in industrial simulations, representing human factors such as human workers psychophysiological states, remains a challenge. This article addresses this issue by introducing the concept of MetaStates which are the digitization and representation of the psychophysiological states of a human worker in the digital world. The MetaStates influence the physical representation and performance of a digital human worker while performing a task. To demonstrate this concept, this study presents the development of a photo-realistic avatar enhanced with multi-level graphical representations of psychophysiological states relevant to Industry 5.0. This approach represents a major step forward in the use of digital humans for industrial simulations, allowing companies to better leverage the benefits of the Industrial Metaverse in their daily operations and simulations while keeping human workers at the center of the system.</description>

      <title>High-quality Surface Reconstruction using Gaussian Surfels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel point-based representation, Gaussian surfels, to combine the advantages of the flexible optimization procedure in 3D Gaussian points and the surface alignment property of surfels. This is achieved by directly setting the z-scale of 3D Gaussian points to 0, effectively flattening the original 3D ellipsoid into a 2D ellipse. Such a design provides clear guidance to the optimizer. By treating the local z-axis as the normal direction, it greatly improves optimization stability and surface alignment. While the derivatives to the local z-axis computed from the covariance matrix are zero in this setting, we design a self-supervised normal-depth consistency loss to remedy this issue. Monocular normal priors and foreground masks are incorporated to enhance the quality of the reconstruction, mitigating issues related to highlights and background. We propose a volumetric cutting method to aggregate the information of Gaussian surfels so as to remove erroneous points in depth maps generated by alpha blending. Finally, we apply screened Poisson reconstruction method to the fused depth maps to extract the surface mesh. Experimental results show that our method demonstrates superior performance in surface reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art neural volume rendering and point-based rendering methods.</description>
