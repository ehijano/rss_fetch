      <title>Tracing cosmic evolution through Weyl-Type f(Q,T) gravity model: theoretical analysis and observational validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmic evolution of the Universe across different cosmological epochs in exponential Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity model. The theoretical analysis involves a detailed dynamical system approach, where we define dimensionless variables and derive a system of linear differential equations to identify critical points corresponding to the radiation, matter and de Siter phase. The findings show the transition from deceleration to acceleration phase, with stable and unstable critical points characterizing different phases of the evolution. In the second approach, we validate the theoretical predictions by using observational data from Cosmic Chronometers ($CC$) and $Pantheon^+$ datasets. We constrain the Hubble parameter and subsequently analysed the other cosmological and geometrical parameters. In this approach also, the transition from deceleration to acceleration has been confirmed, with the equation of state (EoS) parameter approaching $\Lambda$CDM at late times. The further validate this, we present the behaviour of state finder pair. We obtain the age of the Universe $13.81$ Gyr according to $CC$ data and $13.96$ Gyr with the $Pantheon^+$ dataset. The model behaviour in both the approaches shows strong agreement in the late-time behavior of the Universe. The evolutionary behaviour of Hubble parameter and distance modulus, reinforcing the reliability of the Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity model in describing the expansion history of Universe.</description>

      <title>Floating orbits and energy extraction from magnetized Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation reaction on a charged particle around a weakly magnetized Kerr black hole. We solve numerically the Teukolsky equation to find energy fluxes in electromagnetic radiation at the horizon and at spatial infinity. We also employ analytical methods in the low-frequency limit, finding excellent agreement with the numerical results. For a wide range of parameters, energy fluxes on the horizon are negative for all orbital radii: the modes are amplified through superradiance. More interestingly, the flux on the horizon is larger (in absolute value) than the flux at infinity for orbits with orbital radius $r_0 \gtrsim 9M$ -- floating orbits are a generic outcome of having magnetic fields around black holes. Particles on these orbits extract energy from the BH through their radiation field; the net effect is an increase in the particles' kinetic energy, so that they outspiral to infinity. Although in realistic accretion disks viscous forces are expected to dominate, floating orbits remain an interesting feature of the existence of ergoregions in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the expansion of the universe using the Gr\"uneisen parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a perfect fluid, pressure $p$ and energy density $\rho$ are related via the equation of state (EOS) $\omega = p/\rho$, where $\omega$ is the EOS parameter, being its interpretation usually constrained to a numerical value for each universe era. Here, based on the Mie-Gr\"uneisen EOS, we show that $\omega$ is recognized as the effective Gr\"uneisen parameter $\Gamma_{eff}$, whose singular contribution, the so-called Gr\"uneisen ratio $\Gamma$, quantifies the barocaloric effect. Our analysis suggests that the negative $p$ associated with dark-energy implies a metastable state and that in the dark-energy-dominated era $\omega$ is time-dependent, which reinforces recent proposals of a time-dependent cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $\Gamma_{eff}$ is embodied in the energy-momentum stress tensor in the Einstein field equations, enabling us to analyse, in the frame of an imperfect fluid picture, anisotropic effects of the universe expansion. We propose that upon going from decelerated- to accelerated-expansion, a phase transition-like behavior can be inferred. Yet, our analysis in terms of entropy, $\Gamma$, and a by us adapted version of Avramov/Casalini's model to Cosmology unveil hidden aspects related to the expansion of the universe. Our findings pave the way to interpret cosmological phenomena in connection with concepts of condensed matter Physics via $\Gamma_{eff}$.</description>

      <title>Modified particle dynamics and thermodynamics in a traversable wormhole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze various phenomena influenced by the gravitational field in a bumblebee gravity solution, with a particular emphasis on a traversable wormhole for massless particle modes. Specifically, we calculate the index of refraction, group velocity, time delay, modified distances, and interparticle potential, demonstrating the possibility of photon-photon interactions due to the wormhole geometry. For the latter aspect, we also extend the analysis to massive particle modes, resulting in a ``combination'' of modified Yukawa- and Couloumb-like potentials. These calculations are shown to be dependent on the wormhole's parameters, particularly the wormhole throat. Finally, we derive thermodynamic properties for photon-like modes by considering the modified dispersion relation induced by the wormhole geometry, taking into account non-interacting particle modes. Remarkably, all calculations are performed in an analytical manner.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical systematics on testing general relativity with gravitational waves from galactic double white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves have been shown to provide new constraints on gravitational theories beyond general relativity (GR), especially in the strong field regime. Gravitational wave signals from galactic double white dwarfs, expected to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), also have the potential to place stringent bounds on certain theories that give rise to relatively large deviations from GR in less compact binaries, such as through scalar radiation. Nevertheless, the orbital evolution of close double white dwarf systems is also affected by various astrophysical effects, such as stellar rotation, tidal interactions, and magnetic interactions, which add complexity to the gravity tests. In this work, we employ the parametrized post-Einsteinian model to capture the leading beyond-GR effect on the signal and estimate the measurement uncertainties using the Fisher information matrix. We then study the systematic error caused by ignoring each astrophysical effect mentioned above on the parameter estimation. Our numerical results show that, to place bounds on the non-GR effects comparable to existing bounds from pulsar observations, tight priors on the mass of the binary and long observation time are required. At this level of sensitivity, we found that systematic errors from the astrophysical effects dominate statistical errors. The most significant effects investigated here are torques from tidal synchronization and magnetic unipolar induction for sufficiently large magnetic fields ($&gt;10^7$G). Meanwhile, even the weaker astrophysical effects from quadrupolar deformations are of a similar order of magnitude as the statistical uncertainty, and hence cannot be ignored in the waveform model. We conclude that the astrophysical effects must be carefully accounted for in the parameter estimation to test gravity with galactic double white dwarfs detected by LISA.</description>

      <title>Computation of $\langle \Phi^2\rangle$ and quantum fluxes at the polar interior of a spinning black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renormalization of physical quantities for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes can be achieved via the consistent subtraction of counterterms within a regularization scheme such as a point-splitting method. Pragmatic mode-sum regularization (PMR) is a point-splitting method which is particularly suitable for rotating black hole spacetimes. We extend and tailor the t-splitting variant of PMR specifically for the interior of a Kerr black hole on the axis of rotation, focusing on a minimally-coupled massless scalar field in the physically-motivated Unruh state. The method addresses unique challenges in the black hole interior that do not occur outside. In particular, while the infinite sum over multipolar number l converges in the black hole exterior, it diverges in the interior, necessitating the subtraction of a so-called intermediate divergence which includes introducing an additional "small" split in the direction of the polar angle. This procedure is outlined and justified, along with the standard PMR method's counterterms subtraction. We apply this method to calculate the renormalized energy-momentum fluxes $\langle T_{uu}\rangle^U_\text{ren}$, $\langle T_{vv}\rangle^U_\text{ren}$ (where u and v are the standard Eddington coordinates) and the renormalized field square $\langle \Phi^2\rangle^U_\text{ren}$ throughout the black hole interior, spanning from (just off) the event horizon to (just off) the inner horizon. Special emphasis is placed on the inner horizon vicinity, where our t-splitting results for the fluxes asymptote to those obtained directly at the inner horizon using a different method in a previous work. In an Appendix, we develop an alternative t-splitting PMR variant which does not include the intermediate divergence subtraction. We utilize it for independent computations that are used to verify the standard t-splitting variant presented in the main text.</description>

      <title>Throat effects on strong gravitational lensing in Kerr-like wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong gravitational lensing by the Kerr-like wormholes with an additional parameter to specify the location of the throat. We classify the roots of the radial potential derived from the null geodesic equations. We focus on the throat together with other roots to become either double root or triple root, potentially giving the divergence of the deflection angle of the light rays in the strong deflection limit (SDL). In particular, while the logarithmic divergence is known as the double roots are approached, the more stronger power-law (non-logarithmic) divergence is found for the triple roots. In addition, the effective potential in terms of the proper distance from the throat is constructed with which to realize how the light rays can either travel within one spacetime, where the observers are located or pass through the throat into another spacetime, where different observers reside. The observational effects, such as relativistic images resulting from the deflection of light by wormholes, are discussed.</description>

      <title>A complete waveform comparison of post-Newtonian and numerical relativity in eccentric orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a thorough comparative analysis between post-Newtonian (PN) and numerically relativistic (NR) waveforms in eccentric orbits, covering nonspinning and spin-aligned configurations. The comparison examines frequency, amplitude, and phase characteristics of various harmonic modes, such as 22, 21, 33, 32, 44, 43, and 55 modes. The study utilizes eccentric PN waveforms based on 3PN quasi-Keplerian parameterization with 3PN radiative reaction, surpassing Newtonian quadrupole moment with higher-order moments. NR waveforms from RIT and SXS catalogs span mass ratios from 1/4 to 1, eccentricities up to 0.45, and durations exceeding $17000M$ across nonspinning and spin-aligned configurations. Focusing on the 22 mode, frequency comparisons between quadrupole and higher-order moments of $\Psi_4^{22}$ and $h^{22}$ were conducted. Amplitude comparisons revealed superior accuracy in quadrupole moments of $\Psi_4^{22}$. Analysis of total 180 sets of eccentric waveforms showed increasing fitting residuals with rising eccentricity, correlating with smaller mass ratios. Comparisons of initial eccentricity from PN fitting, 3PN quasi-Keplerian parameterization, and RIT/SXS catalogs revealed alignment discrepancies. Frequency, phase, and amplitude comparisons of 22 modes showed consistent inspiral behavior between PN and NR, with divergences near merger for nonspinning PN and pre-200M for spin-aligned PN.</description>

      <title>Electrification of a non-rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zajacek et al made an interesting theoretical prediction on the electrification of a non-rotating black hole; if a non-rotating black hole is surrounded by plasma composed of protons and electrons, it will acquire electric charge due to the large difference of the inertial mass of a proton and that of an electron. Furthermore they revealed the effects of the electric charge of the black hole on the surrounding plasma. Since their results mainly rely on non-relativistic analyses, we study the same subject through relativistic analyses in this paper. By investigating a test particle in the Schwarzschild spacetime, we find that if initial velocities of protons and electrons far from a black hole follow the Maxwell distribution, the black hole can acquire electric charge whose value depends on the ratio of temperature of the proton and that of the electron. We also show that if the black hole acquires the electric charge, the radii of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the specific energy of a charged particle on ISCO can be very different from those of a neutral particle. In contrast to the result obtained by Zajacek et al, we find that the ISCO radii of a proton and an electron are necessarily larger than that of a neutral test particle as long as the black hole acquires the charge. The large ISCO radius might lead to a larger angular diameter of a black hole shadow and a different estimate of the released energy due to the accretion of plasma from the estimate based on the assumption of electric neutrality of the central black hole.</description>

      <title>Motion of spinning particles around black hole in a dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of a rapidly rotating object in curved spacetime is affected by the spin-curvature force, an effect captured in the motion of spinning test particles. Recently, Cardoso et al.~[Phys. Rev. D 105, L061501 (2022)] found an exact solution describing a black hole immersed in a Hernquist distribution of dark matter. In this work, we investigate the motion of spinning particles around this black hole. We use the Mathison-Papapetrou-Dixon equation and the Tulczyjew spin-supplementary condition to calculate the effective potential, four-momentum, and four-velocity of the spinning particle. The equatorial motion of spinning test particles and the properties of the innermost stable circular orbit are further studied. We find that the existence of dark matter halos can significantly change the orbital eccentricity, energy, and the innermost stable circular orbit parameters of spinning test particles. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, dark matter halos bring the innermost stable circular orbit of a spinning test particle closer to the event horizon. These results could help us understanding the properties of black holes in dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals: A gateway to probe quantum gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a loop quantum gravity (LQG) inspired rotating black hole, treating it as a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, where an inspiralling object exhibits eccentric motion around the SMBH. With the orbital dynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital evolution, and subsequently generate the gravitational waveforms. To evaluate the difference between EMR waveforms emitted from the Kerr black hole and a spinning black hole in LQG, we compute the dephasing and mismatch using the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observation. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the modified effect of LQG with a parameter as small as $2\times10^{-6}$. The constraint on a parameter in LQG using the Fisher information matrix can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining string cosmology with the gravitational-wave background using the NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) collaboration has recently reported strong evidence for a signal at nanohertz, potentially the first detection of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We investigate whether the NANOGrav signal is consistent with the SGWB predicted by string cosmology models. By performing Bayesian parameter estimation on the NANOGrav 15-year data set, we constrain the key parameters of a string cosmology model: the frequency $f_s$ and the fractional energy density $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s}$ of gravitational waves at the end of the dilaton-driven stage, and the Hubble parameter $H_r$ at the end of the string phase. Our analysis yields constraints of $f_s = 1.2^{+0.6}_{-0.6}\times 10^{-8} \mathrm{Hz}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s} = 2.9^{+5.4}_{-2.3}\times 10^{-8}$, consistent with theoretical predictions from string cosmology. However, the current NANOGrav data is not sensitive to the $H_r$ parameter. We also compare the string cosmology model to a simple power-law model using Bayesian model selection, finding a Bayes factor of $2.2$ in favor of the string cosmology model. Our results demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to constrain cosmological models and study the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Formulating the complete initial boundary value problem in numerical relativity to model black hole echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an attempt to simulate black hole echoes (generated by potential quantum-gravitational structure) in numerical relativity, we recently described how to implement a reflecting boundary outside of the horizon of a black hole in spherical symmetry. Here, we generalize this approach to spacetimes with no symmetries and implement it numerically using the generalized harmonic formulation. We cast the evolution equations and the numerical implementation into a Summation By Parts (SBP) scheme, which seats our method closer to a class of provably numerically stable systems. We implement an embedded boundary numerical framework that allows for arbitrarily shaped domains on a rectangular grid and even boundaries that evolve and move across the grid. As a demonstration of this framework, we study the evolution of gravitational wave scattering off a boundary either inside, or just outside, the horizon of a black hole. This marks a big leap toward the goal of a generic framework to obtain gravitational waveforms for behaviors motivated by quantum gravity near the horizons of merging black holes.</description>

      <title>On relativistic dynamical tides: subtleties and calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of astrophysical compact objects to external tidal fields carries valuable information on the nature of these objects, on the equation of state of matter, and on the underlying gravitational theory. In this work, we highlight subtleties in describing relativistic dynamical tidal responses that arise from ambiguities in the decomposition of a perturbed metric into external tidal and induced response pieces. Observables are unambiguous. However in practice, differences arising from implicit assumptions in the definition of tidal deformabilities may lead to a bias in constraining nuclear physics or gravitational theories, if not properly tied to observational data. We propose calibration of a tidal response function for any compact objects in vacuum General Relativity. Within this framework, the dynamical tidal Love numbers of a Schwarzschild black hole in both even and odd sectors vanish at any multipole order. The calibration allows one to define dynamical tidal deformabilities of relativistic stars, such as neutron stars, as the difference from the BH values (zero) under the unified definition in a simple manner. As a straightforward extension of our framework, we compute the next-to-leading dissipative tidal response of Schwarzschild black holes for the first time.</description>

      <title>Stability of saddles and choices of contour in the Euclidean path integral for linearized gravity: Dependence on the DeWitt Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the conformal factor problem, the definition of the Euclidean gravitational path integral requires a non-trivial choice of contour. The present work examines a generalization of a recently proposed rule-of-thumb \cite{Marolf:2022ntb} for selecting this contour at quadratic order about a saddle. The original proposal depended on the choice of an indefinite-signature metric on the space of perturbations, which was taken to be a DeWitt metric with parameter $\alpha =-1$. This choice was made to match previous results, but was otherwise admittedly {\it ad hoc}. To begin to investigate the physics associated with the choice of such a metric, we now explore contours defined using analogous prescriptions for $\alpha \neq -1$. We study such contours for Euclidean gravity linearized about AdS-Schwarzschild black holes in reflecting cavities with thermal (canonical ensemble) boundary conditions, and we compare path-integral stability of the associated saddles with thermodynamic stability of the classical spacetimes. While the contour generally depends on the choice of DeWitt parameter $\alpha$, the precise agreement between these two notions of stability found at $\alpha =-1$ continues to hold over the finite interval $(-2,-2/d)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the bulk spacetime. This agreement manifestly fails for $\alpha &gt; -2/d$ when the DeWitt metric becomes positive definite. However, we also find dramatic failures for $\alpha&lt; -2$ that correlate with breakdowns of the de Donder-like gauge condition defined by $\alpha$, and at which the relevant fluctuation operator fails to be diagonalizable. This provides criteria that may be useful in predicting metrics on the space of perturbations that give physically-useful contours in more general settings. Along the way, we also identify an interesting error in \cite{Marolf:2022ntb}, though we show this error to be harmless.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer R\'enyi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer R\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.</description>

      <title>Parting gravity's tail: quadrupole tails at fifth order and beyond via integer partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the systematic organization of higher-order gravitational quadrupole tails using generalized unitarity methods imported from the study of scattering amplitudes. The first major result is a constructive algorithm for generic arbitrary-order tail effective actions which links the structure of their loop integral basis expansion with integer partitions, and predicts that only a single new unitarity cut needs to be evaluated at each tail order with all other contributions given in terms of lower-loop data. The algorithm is employed to compute the tail-of-tail-of-tail-of-tail-of-tail (T$^5$) contributions to the effective action and associated energy loss to gravitational waves. Validation of the new effective action and radiated energy is done through counterterm extraction and renormalization analysis, leading to complete agreement with known counterterms and renormalization flow equations.</description>

      <title>Implications of the Milky Way Declining Rotation Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Almost all spiral galaxies have been observed to have flattening rotation curves. The new Gaia DR3 released data shows a Milky Way sharply Keplerian declining rotation curve, starting at $\sim 16$ kpc and ending at 26.5 kpc. The data reduces the total Milky Way mass by an order of magnitude, $M=2.06\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$, compared to the standard required dark matter halo mass, $(2-5)\times10^{12}M_\odot$. Newtonian and modified gravity (MOG) fits are applied to the Gaia DR3 rotation curve data. The fit obtained using MOG has a total mass of $M\sim1.3\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$, while the Newtonian fit predicts a mass of $M\sim2\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$. These are in excess of the estimated visible baryon mass of the Milky Way, $M_b\sim (0.6-1.0)\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}$. It is possible that if the cicumgalactic (CGM) plasma-gas continues to be confirmed experimentally, then the additional baryon mass required to account for the estimated total Milky Way mass could be attributed to the CGM hot plasma-gas halo.</description>

      <title>Euclidean and complex geometries from real-time computations of gravitational R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational R\'enyi computations have traditionally been described in the language of Euclidean path integrals. In the semiclassical limit, such calculations are governed by Euclidean (or, more generally, complex) saddle-point geometries. We emphasize here that, at least in simple contexts, the Euclidean approach suggests an alternative formulation in terms of the bulk quantum wavefunction. Since this alternate formulation can be directly applied to the real-time quantum theory, it is insensitive to subtleties involved in defining the Euclidean path integral. In particular, it can be consistent with many different choices of integration contour.
  Despite the fact that self-adjoint operators in the associated real-time quantum theory have real eigenvalues, we note that the bulk wavefunction encodes the Euclidean (or complex) R\'enyi geometries that would arise in any Euclidean path integral. As a result, for any given quantum state, the appropriate real-time path integral yields both R\'enyi entropies and associated complex saddle-point geometries that agree with Euclidean methods. After brief explanations of these general points, we use JT gravity to illustrate the associated real-time computations in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational data seem to show a $\gtrsim 3\sigma$ evidence for an evolving dark energy (DE) against the cosmological constant, so the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper, we perform the search for the primordial gravitational waves with the potential pre-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension, using recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization, Planck CMB and Pantheon supernova data, which reveal that the low bound of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is $&gt; 1.5\sigma$ non-zero with the bestfit $r_{0.05}\sim 0.01$ and the scalar spectral index $n_s= 1$ (both $|r_{0.05}-0.01|$ and $|n_s-1|\sim {\cal O} (0.001)$). In particular, we observe the unnoticed impact of CMB B-mode polarization data for constraining the nature of DE, which together with early dark energy solutions to the Hubble tension is calling for the return of post-recombination $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new family of operators in 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with a non-vanishing Weyl scalar (non-degenerate spaces) that keep the conformal covariance of \emph{conformally covariant tensor concomitants}. A particular case that arises naturally is the $\mathcal{C}$-connection that is a Weyl connection that keeps \emph{conformal invariance}. Using the $\mathcal{C}-$connection we give a new characterization of non-degenerate spaces that are conformal to an Einstein space.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background by pulsar timing array observations of both the background and individual supermassive binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (BBHs) are long sought by pulsar timing array experiments (PTAs), in the forms of both a stochastic GW background (GWB) and individual sources. The evidence for a GWB was reported recently by several PTAs with origins to be determined. Here we use a BBH population synthesis model to investigate the detection probability of individual BBHs by the Chinese PTA (CPTA) and the constraint on the GWB origin that may be obtained by PTA observations of both GWB and individual BBHs. If the detected GWB signal is entirely due to BBHs, a significantly positive redshift evolution ($\propto(1+z)^{2.07}$) of the mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is required. In this case, we find that the detection probability of individual BBHs is $\sim85\%$ or 64% if using a period of 3.4-year CPTA observation data, with an expectation of $\sim1.9$ or 1.0 BBHs detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio $\geq3$ or $5$, and it is expected to increase to $&gt;95\%$ if extending the observation period to $5$ years or longer. Even if the contribution from BBHs to the GWB power signal is as small as $\sim10\%$, a positive detection of individual BBHs can still be expected within an observation period of $\sim10$ years. A non-detection of individual BBHs within several years from now jointly with the detected GWB signal can put a strong constraint on the upper limit of the BBH contribution to the GWB signal and help identify/falsify a cosmological origin.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian limit of ModMax electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Carrollian limit of ModMax electrodynamics, namely the limit of vanishing speed of light, for the most general, four-dimensional, duality and conformal invariant electromagnetism. The theory is parameterized by a unique real constant $\gamma$, which remains playing a non-trivial role in the magnetic Carrollian case, while it can be removed in the electric Carrollian contraction, and we therefore focus in the former. Applying the technique of Lie point symmetries, we obtain that the magnetic limit is invariant under the Carrollian group, as well as under the local translation in Carrollian time $x^{0}\rightarrow x^{0\prime}=x^{0}+f\left(x^{i}\right) $ and $x^{i}\rightarrow x^{i\prime}=x^{i}$, with $f$ being an arbitrary function. A diagonal part of the symmetries span the Conformal Carroll algebra of level $2$, $\mathfrak{ccarr}_2$ in four dimensions. Two additional internal symmetries remain in the Carrollian limit of ModMax standing for the conformal invariance of the theory, as well as the invariance under duality transformations.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that in quantum gravity, the very geometry of space and time is subject to continual fluctuation. The mathematical formulation for this old theory is still lacking. This article formulates this more than forty-year-old theory of quantum gravity, the result of which is that the equations of quantum gravity become fractional. The existence of such fluctuations is proved indirectly. On the other hand, recent attention has been paid to fractional gravity. Although this type of gravity leads to brilliant results, we have no root and logical reason for applying it other than that it works. We actually simultaneously demonstrate that fractional gravity is generated by stochastic quantum fluctuations of space-time. For clarification, Einstein-Hilbert theory along with a scalar field is investigated in deformed and non-deformed minisuperspaces. The results illustrate a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion (late-time-accelerated expansion).</description>

      <title>Angular power spectra of anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background: developing statistical methods and analyzing data from ground-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unresolved sources of gravitational waves can create a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) which may have intrinsic or extrinsic anisotropies. The angular power spectrum is a well-suited estimator for characterizing diffuse anisotropic distributions in the sky. Here we estimate the first model-independent all-sky all-frequency SGWB angular power spectra in the 20-1726 Hz frequency range from the third observing run (O3) of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We develop a method to use the spectrum's signal-to-noise ratio as the detection statistic and show that the shape of the distribution of the statistic obtained from the data agrees with the analytical model with a modified value of the parameter. Since we find the data to be consistent with noise, $95\%$ confidence Bayesian upper limits are set on the angular power spectra, ranging from $C_\ell^{1/2}\leq(3.0\times10^{-9}-0.73)~\text{sr}^{-1}$. We also introduce a method to combine the narrow band angular power spectra to obtain estimators for broadband SGWB. These results can directly constrain theoretical models that predict the SGWB angular power spectra and for estimating or constraining the corresponding parameters. In addition, the results and the techniques introduced in this work can be useful for performing correlation-based searches, for instance, with electromagnetic observations.</description>

Abstract: We derive the exact solutions for electrically charged black holes both in the absence and presence of a cosmological constant in the gravitational theory with Lorentz violation induced by a background Kalb-Ramond (KR) field. The corresponding thermodynamic properties are investigated. It is found that the standard first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr formula remain valid for the charged KR black holes. Nevertheless, the Lorentz-violating effect influences their ranges of local thermodynamic stability and the first- and second-order phase transition points. Furthermore, to examine the impact of Lorentz violation on the motion of test particles in the spacetime, we analyze the shadow and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of these black holes. Our results reveal that both the shadow and ISCO radii exhibit a high sensitivity to the Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$, with a decrease observed as $\ell$ increases.</description>

Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy - the "thunder") and seeing (via VLBI imaging - the "lightning") BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

      <title>Cosmic variance of the Hellings and Downs correlation for ensembles of universes having nonzero angular power spectra</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) induce correlated perturbations to the arrival times of pulses from an array of galactic millisecond pulsars. The expected correlations, obtained by averaging over many pairs of pulsars having the same angular separation (pulsar averaging) and over an ensemble of model universes (ensemble averaging), are described by the Hellings and Downs curve. As shown by Allen [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043018 (2023)], the pulsar-averaged correlation will not agree exactly with the expected Hellings and Downs prediction if the gravitational-wave sources interfere with one another, differing instead by a "cosmic variance" contribution. The precise shape and size of the cosmic variance depends on the statistical properties of the ensemble of universes used to model the background. Here, we extend the calculations of the cosmic variance for the standard Gaussian ensemble to an ensemble of model universes which collectively has rotationally invariant correlations in the GW power on different angular scales (described by an angular power spectrum, $C_\ell$ for $\ell=0,1,\cdots$.). We obtain an analytic form for the cosmic variance in terms of the $C_\ell$'s and show that for realistic values $C_{\ell}/C_0\lesssim 10^{-3}$, there is virtually no difference in the cosmic variance compared to that for the standard Gaussian ensemble (which has a zero angular power spectrum).</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference of black hole ringdowns in the time domain</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by a ringing black hole allow us to perform precision tests of general relativity in the strong field regime. With improvements to our current gravitational wave detectors and upcoming next-generation detectors, developing likelihood-free parameter inference infrastructure is critical as we will face complications like nonstandard noise properties, partial data and incomplete signal modeling that may not allow for an analytically tractable likelihood function. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept strategy to perform likelihood-free Bayesian inference on ringdown gravitational waves using simulation based inference. Specifically, our method is based on truncated sequential neural posterior estimation, which trains a neural density estimator of the posterior for a specific observed data segment. We setup the ringdown parameter estimation directly in the time domain. We show that the parameter estimation results obtained using our trained networks are in agreement with well-established Markov-chain methods for simulated injections as well as analysis on real detector data corresponding to GW150914. Additionally, to assess our approach's internal consistency, we show that the density estimators pass a Bayesian coverage test.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gertsenshtein effect could in principle be used to detect a single graviton by firing it through a region filled with a constant magnetic field that enables its conversion to a photon, which can be efficiently detected via standard techniques. The quantization of the gravitational field could then be inferred indirectly. We show that for currently available single-photon detector technology, the Gertsenshtein detector is generically inefficient, meaning that the probability of detection is $\ll 1$. The Gertsenshtein detector can become efficient on astrophysical scales for futuristic single-photon detectors sensitive to frequencies in the Hz to kHz range. It is not clear whether such devices are in principle possible.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Polarization Detection with Tetrahedron Constellation of Gravitational Wave Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we have introduced the Tetrahedron Constellation of Gravitational Wave Observatory (TEGO) composed of four identical spacecrafts (S/Cs). The laser telescopes and their pointing structures are mounted on the S/C platform and are evenly distributed at three locations 120 degrees apart. These structures form automatically a stable mass center for the platform. The time delay interferometry (TDI) are used to suppress the frequency noise of Gravitational Wave (GW) detector. The unequal arm Michelson TDI configuration and the Sagnac TDI configuration are equally effective at eliminating the laser frequency noise based on the TEGO configuration. Furthermore, comparing to the configurations of LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, the TEGO has more combinations of optical paths in its TDI system sensitive to GW signals. The six arms of TEGO are simultaneously sensitive to the six polarization modes of GWs. The sensitivity implies that GW modes beyond the predictions of general relativity (GR) can be detected directly. For instance, a scalar longitudinal mode of GWs, which is not predicted by GR, has been identified as a dominant polarization component. This mode is found to be evident in the response amplitudes of the TEGO arms, such as between S/C1 and S/C4, and S/C3 and S/C4, at certain orbital positions.</description>

      <title>Deflection of light by wormholes and its shadow due to dark matter within modified symmetric teleparallel gravity formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of traversable wormhole formation in the dark matter halos in the context of $f(Q)$ gravity. We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating in Starobinsky inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of achieving post-inflationary reheating exclusively through the gravitational interaction in Starobinsky inflation, which itself assumes nothing but gravity. We consider the possibility that the reheating sector couples to gravity via a non-minimal coupling. Our analysis is performed both in a perturbative and in a non-perturbative approach, where particle production is computed from Bogoliubov coefficients. Our findings indicate that, for a minimal coupling, a reheating temperature $T_\text{reh}\sim 10^{8}$~GeV is obtained, with a reheating duration of approximately 21 $e$-folds. We also show that non perturbative gravitational production during preheating can lead to maximum temperatures of the order of $10^{12}$ GeV. This shows that the gravitational interaction could be the sole responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, without the need to assume other \emph{ad hoc} inflaton interactions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave background in bouncing models from semi-classical, quantum and string gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the primordial spectra and the gravitational-wave background (GWB) of three models of semi-classical, quantum or string gravity where the big bang is replaced by a bounce and the primordial tensor spectrum is blue: ekpyrotic universe with fast-rolling Galileons, string-gas cosmology with Atick-Witten conjecture and pre-big-bang cosmology. We find that the ekpyrotic scenario with Galileons does not produce a GWB amplitude detectable by present or third-generation interferometers, while the Atick-Witten-based string-gas model is ruled out in its present form for violating the big-bang-nucleosynthesis bound, contrary to the original string-gas scenario. In contrast, the GWB of the pre-big-bang scenario falls within the sensitivity window of both LISA and Einstein Telescope, where it takes the form of a single or a broken power law depending on the choice of parameters. The latter will be tightly constrained by both detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how quantum geometrodynamics, a conservative approach to quantum gravity, might explain the emergence of classical spacetime and, with it, the emergence of classical time and its arrow from the universal quantum state. This follows from a particular but reasonable choice of boundary condition motivated by the structure of the Hamiltonian of the theory. This condition can also be seen as defining a quantum version of Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis. We comment on the relation of this picture to the `past hypothesis' and the different observed arrows of time, and we consider how quantum geometrodynamics could serve as a unifying and more fundamental framework to explain these observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass of a black hole can dynamically evolve due to various physical processes, such as for instance accretion, Hawking radiation, absorption of gravitational/electromagnetic waves, superradiance, etc. This evolution can have an impact on astrophysical observables, like the ringdown gravitational signal. An effective description of a spherically symmetric black hole with evolving mass is provided by the Vaidya metric. In our investigation, we explore the dynamics of linear perturbations on this background, assuming a constant rate of change for the mass. Despite the time-dependent background, a judicious change of coordinates allows us to treat the perturbations in the frequency domain, and to compute explicitly the quasi-normal modes and the tidal Love numbers.</description>

Abstract: We consider dynamics of a scalar field in compactification scenario of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology. It is shown that if the field is non-minimally coupled to curvature, its asymptotic value under certain conditions may be shifted from the minimum of its potential. This means that due to influence of extra dimensions a scalar field with $\lambda \phi^4$ potential can stabilise away from $\phi=0$ stable point which means an effective symmetry breaking occurs in such a system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a quantization of the Schwarzschild spacetime in the presence of a cosmological constant, based on midisuperspace methods developed in the spherically symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity, using in particular the 'improved dynamics' scheme. We include both the de Sitter and anti-de Sitter cases. We find that the quantization puts a Planckian positive upper limit on the possible values of the cosmological constant similar to the bounds obtained earlier from studies of homogeneous spacetimes. This means that, for negative cosmological constant, no negative bound is found. Moreover, using semiclassical physical states, we obtain the effective metric and demonstrate the causal structure for various cases. Quantum gravity modifications ensure that the singularity is replaced by a transition surface in all the cases, where the curvature invariants approach mass-independent Planckian bounds. Analysis of the effective stress-energy tensor shows that the null energy condition is strongly violated in the vicinity of the transition surface. Moreover, it shows a weaker asymptotic fall off for a nonvanishing cosmological constant, which could have interesting phenomenological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact formula $F(e) = 2 \hbar \frac{dN}{dJ}$ which provides a concrete estimate for the total number and angular momentum of gravitons emitted during the nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes. We show that the function $F(e)$ is a slowly growing monotonic function of the eccentricity $0 \le e \le 1$ and $F(1) = 1.012\, 815 \, 967 \,259 \,511 \cdots $. We confirm and extend the results of Page for the function $F(e)$. We also get an exact result for the ratio $\nu (e_i) = \frac{2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)}{L_i}$ of the sum of the spin angular momentum magnitudes of gravitons emitted to the magnitude $L_i$ of the total angular momentum emitted in the graviational waves by inspiraling binary black holes. If the orbit starts off with unit eccentricity $e_i=1$, we get the exact value $\nu(1) = 1.002\, 268\, 666\, 2 \pm 10^{-10}$ which confirms the Page conjecture. We also show that the formula $F(e)$ for gravitons emitted can be determined by a single function.</description>

Abstract: We study axisymmetric solutions to the wave equation on extremal Kerr backgrounds and obtain integrated local energy decay (or Morawetz estimates) through an analysis \textit{exclusively in physical-space}. Boundedness of the energy and Morawetz estimates for axisymmetric waves in extremal Kerr were first obtained by Aretakis through the construction of frequency-localized currents used in particular to express the trapping degeneracy. Here we extend to extremal Kerr a method introduced by Stogin in the sub-extremal case, simplifying Aretakis' derivation of Morawetz estimates through purely classical currents.</description>

Abstract: Recent no-go theorems on interpretations of quantum theory featuring an assumption of `Absoluteness of Observed Events' (AOE) are shown to have an unexpectedly strong corollary: one cannot reject AOE and at the same time assume that the `observed events' in question can all be embedded within a single background space-time common to all observers. Consequently, interpretations that reject AOE appear incompatible with a `block universe' view of space-time.</description>

Based on an explicit calculation, we provide a new expression for the cross section that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and refines existing constraints for the LIV scale, while we introduce a new approximation that may be useful in LIV scenarios beyond effective field theory. These improvements appear essential for setting constraints on LIV effects with future observations at ultra-high energies, where previous approximations may fall short.</description>

      <title>A new diagnostic for the null test of dynamical dark energy in light of DESI 2024 and other BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new diagnostic for the null tests of dynamical dark energy alongside two other combined equivalent diagnostics. These diagnostics are useful, especially when we include anisotropic baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data in an analysis, to quantify the deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We also consider another diagnostic for isotropic BAO observations. These null tests are independent of any late-time dark energy model or parametrization. With these diagnostics, we study the evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 data combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations of the Planck 2018 mission and local $H_0$ measurements. We find no strong evidence for dynamical dark energy. The exclusion of the individual deviations at the effective redshift 0.51 of the DESI 2024 data makes the evidence even weaker. We get nearly similar results for other non-DESI BAO data. Both for DESI 2024 and other non-DESI BAO data, the evidence is almost independent of early-time physics. The evidence corresponding to the SHOES value of $H_0$ is higher than the corresponding tRGB value of $H_0$ for all combinations of data, but still not strong enough to reject the flat $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Overlap reduction functions for pulsar timing arrays and astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient technique for calculating the angular two-point correlation functions (or ``overlap reduction functions'') induced by gravitational waves in both the pulse arrival times of pulsars and in the angular deflections of distant sources. In the most general case, there are six auto- and cross-correlations for the pulse arrival times and the two components of the angular deflection. We provide results for spin-2 (i.e., general-relativistic) gravitational waves as well as the spin-1 modes that may arise in alternative-gravity theories. These calculations can be easily implemented for future analysis or study, and we provide code to do so.</description>

      <title>A generalized method of constraining Warm Inflation with CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A thorough MCMC analysis of any inflationary model against the current cosmological data is essential for assessing the validity of such a model as a viable inflationary model. Warm Inflation, producing both thermal and quantum fluctuations, yield a complex form of scalar power spectrum, which, in general, cannot be directly written as a function of the comoving wavenumber $k$, an essential step to incorporate the primordial spectra into CAMB to do an MCMC analysis through CosmoMC/Cobaya. In this paper, we devised an efficient generalized methodology to mould the WI power spectra as a function of $k$, without the need of slow-roll approximation of the inflationary dynamics. The methodology is directly applicable to any Warm Inflation model, including the ones with complex forms of the dissipative coefficient and the inflaton potential.</description>

      <title>Graviton Number Radiated During Binary Inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The total number of gravitons emitted during nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes or other effectively point masses is calculated approximately and found to be remarkably close to (well within 1% of, perhaps within about 0.2% of) the initial orbital angular momentum divided by the spin angular momentum of each graviton ($2\hbar$), although at unit initial eccentricity, $2\hbar$ times the initial graviton number emission per angular momentum emission is $248/(45\sqrt{3}\pi) \approx 1.012\,811\,600\,479$, almost 1.3% greater than unity.</description>

      <title>Mixmasters in Wonderland: Chaotic dynamics from Carroll limits of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Carroll limit of general relativity coupled to matter captures the chaotic mixmaster dynamics of near-singularity limits. Zooming in on the behavior of general relativity close to spacelike singularities reveals rich and solvable ultra-local Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) dynamics, which we show to be captured by a Carroll limit. Specifically, building on recent work on geometric Carroll expansions of general relativity, we establish that leading-order Carroll gravity, with suitable matter coupling, accurately describes well-known cosmological billiards behavior. Since the Carroll limit implements the ultra-local limit off shell, this opens up the door to a wide range of possible tractable applications, including spatially inhomogeneous setups and the emergence of spikes at late times. This further suggests that Carroll gravity, along with its subleading corrections, could serve as a valuable tool for studying deep infrared physics in AdS/CFT.</description>
