      <title>Introduction to Analytical Software Engineering Design Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As modern software systems expand in scale and complexity, the challenges associated with their modeling and formulation grow increasingly intricate. Traditional approaches often fall short in effectively addressing these complexities, particularly in tasks such as design pattern detection for maintenance and assessment, as well as code refactoring for optimization and long-term sustainability. This growing inadequacy underscores the need for a paradigm shift in how such challenges are approached and resolved. This paper presents Analytical Software Engineering (ASE), a novel design paradigm aimed at balancing abstraction, tool accessibility, compatibility, and scalability. ASE enables effective modeling and resolution of complex software engineering problems. The paradigm is evaluated through two frameworks Behavioral-Structural Sequences (BSS) and Optimized Design Refactoring (ODR), both developed in accordance with ASE principles. BSS offers a compact, language-agnostic representation of codebases to facilitate precise design pattern detection. ODR unifies artifact and solution representations to optimize code refactoring via heuristic algorithms while eliminating iterative computational overhead. By providing a structured approach to software design challenges, ASE lays the groundwork for future research in encoding and analyzing complex software metrics.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Nonlinear Mixed-Integer Location Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For three decades, carrier-phase observations have been used to obtain the most accurate location estimates using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). These estimates are computed by minimizing a nonlinear mixed-integer least-squares problem. Existing algorithms linearize the problem, orthogonally project it to eliminate real variables, and then solve the integer least-square problem. There is now considerable interest in developing similar localization techniques for terrestrial and indoor settings. We show that algorithms that linearize first fail in these settings and we propose several algorithms for computing the estimates. Some of our algorithms are elimination algorithms that start by eliminating the non-linear terms in the constraints; others construct a geometric arrangement that allows us to efficiently enumerate integer solutions (in polynomial time). We focus on simplified localization problems in which the measurements are range (distance) measurements and carrier phase range measurements, with no nuisance parameters. The simplified problem allows us to focus on the core question of untangling the nonlinearity and the integer nature of some parameters. We show using simulations that the new algorithms are effective at close ranges at which the linearize-first approach fails.</description>

      <title>KHRONOS: a Kernel-Based Neural Architecture for Rapid, Resource-Efficient Scientific Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary models of high dimensional physical systems are constrained by the curse of dimensionality and a reliance on dense data. We introduce KHRONOS (Kernel Expansion Hierarchy for Reduced Order, Neural Optimized Surrogates), an AI framework for model based, model free and model inversion tasks. KHRONOS constructs continuously differentiable target fields with a hierarchical composition of per-dimension kernel expansions, which are tensorized into modes and then superposed. We evaluate KHRONOS on a canonical 2D, Poisson equation benchmark: across 16 to 512 degrees of freedom (DoFs), it obtained L2 square errors of 5e-4 down to 6e-10. This represents a 100 time gain over Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (which itself reports a 100 times improvement on MLPs/PINNs with 100 times fewer parameters) when controlling for the number of parameters. This also represents a 1e4 times improvement in L2 square error compared to standard linear FEM at comparable DoFs. Inference complexity is dominated by inner products, yielding sub-millisecond full-field predictions that scale to an arbitrary resolution. For inverse problems, KHRONOS facilitates rapid, iterative level set recovery in only a few forward evaluations, with sub-microsecond per sample latency. KHRONOS scalability, expressivity, and interpretability open new avenues in constrained edge computing, online control, computer vision, and beyond.</description>
