      <title>A Supervised Machine Learning Framework for Multipactor Breakdown Prediction in High-Power Radio Frequency Devices and Accelerator Components: A Case Study in Planar Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models - including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.</description>

      <title>Squeezing enhanced sensing at an exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pushing the boundaries of measurement precision is central for sensing and metrology, pursued by nonclassical resources such as squeezing, and non-Hermitian degeneracies with distinct spectral response. Their convergence, however, remains challenging. We find extraordinary enhancement of sensitivity by unifying both effects in a general framework for quantum sensing in open systems. At the parametric oscillation threshold and an exceptional point, the sensing precision exhibits a unique quartic scaling with the perturbation strength. The result generalizes to multimode squeezed-state sensors with higher-order exceptional points catered to various quantum sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Ultra-clean interface between high k dielectric and 2D MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for next-generation transistor channels due to their superior scaling properties. However, the integration of ultra-thin gate dielectrics remains a challenge, as conventional oxides such as SiO2, Al2O3, and HfO2 tend to unintentionally dope 2D TMDs and introduce interfacial defect states, leading to undesirable field-effect transistor (FET) performance and unstable threshold voltages. Here, we demonstrate that zirconium oxide (ZrO2), a high-k dielectric compatible with semiconductor processing, forms an ultra-clean interface with monolayer MoS2. Using soft and hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory, we find that ZrO2 does not measurably interact with MoS2, in contrast to significant doping observed for SiO2 and HfO2 substrates. As a result, back-gated monolayer MoS2 FETs fabricated with ZrO2 dielectrics exhibit stable and positive threshold voltages (0.36 plus/minus 0.3 V), low subthreshold swing (75 mV per decade), and high ON currents exceeding 400 microamperes. We further demonstrate p-type WSe2 FETs with ON currents greater than 200 microamperes per micrometer by suppressing electron doping with ZrO2 dielectrics. Atomic-resolution imaging confirms a defect-free ZrO2/MoS2 interface, which enables top-gate FETs with an equivalent oxide thickness of 0.86 nanometers and subthreshold swing of 80 mV per decade. Moreover, the ultraclean ZrO2/MoS2 interface allows for effective threshold voltage modulation in top-gate FETs via gate metal work function engineering. These findings establish ZrO2 as a highly promising, industry-compatible high-k dielectric for scalable 2D TMD-based electronics.</description>

      <title>Real-time analog circuit for auto-correlative weak-value amplification in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The auto-correlative weak-value amplification (AWVA) technique demonstrates distinct advantages over standard weak-value amplification (SWVA) for quantum parameter estimation. To achieve enhanced precision in real-time parameter estimation, the AWVA requires additional resources compared to SWVA, namely real-time multiplication and integrator modules. We implemented a real-time analog circuit for AWVA using an AD835 multiplier and an NE5532 operational amplifier for the integrator. The circuit was tested using Gaussian pointers in the AWVA scheme, exhibiting sufficient sensitivity for Gaussian pointers with frequencies 200 Hz &lt; f &lt; 20kHz. Compared to SWVA, AWVA achieves higher accuracy and superior robustness against noise at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of -12 dB &lt; SNR &lt; -4 dB. Beyond quantum metrology, the circuit is applicable to diverse detection schemes for correlated signals.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of magnetic textures in stripe domain bifurcations for reconfigurable domain wall racetracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the racetrack memory paradigm, systems exploiting magnetic guiding potentials instead of geometrical ones, allow for enhancing the versatility of the final devices adding magnetic reconfigurable capabilities. Hard/soft magnetic multilayers with stripe domain configurations fulfill these requirements. In these systems, the topology of the generated textures that would act as information carriers, is strongly conditioned by the stripe lattice configuration. Micromagnetic simulations have been used to study the magnetization reversal process in NdCo$_5$/Py reconfigurable racetracks. By using skyrmionic charges and magnetic vorticity lines, the topological transformations controlling the nucleation of vortices, antivortices, Bloch lines and Bloch points has been analyzed. It has been shown that magnetic topological charge exchanges between textures rule the formation of vortex/antivortex pairs with opposite polarities, key for the guided propagation through the stripe pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard Potts model is a fundamental model in statistical physics that generalizes the Ising model. Although Ising machines, as Langevin models, have been widely studied for sampling the Ising model, studies of Langevin models for sampling the standard Potts model are still lacking. In this work, we present a compact and physically realizable Langevin model that serves as a sampler for sampling the low-energy spin configurations of the standard Potts model.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mobility in Spatial Biodiversity Models through Recurrence Quantification Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrence plots and their associated quantifiers provide a robust framework for detecting and characterising complex patterns in non-linear time-series. In this paper, we employ recurrence quantification analysis to investigate the dynamics of the cyclic, non-hierarchical May-Leonard model, also referred to as rock--paper--scissors systems, that describes competitive interactions among three species. A crucial control parameter in these systems is the species' mobility $m$, which governs the spatial displacement of individuals and profoundly influences the resulting dynamics. By systematically varying $m$ and constructing suitable recurrence plots from numerical simulations, we explore how recurrence quantifiers reflect distinct dynamical features associated with different ecological states. We then introduce an ensemble-based approach that leverages statistical distributions of recurrence quantifiers, computed from numerous independent realisations, allowing us to identify dynamical outliers as significant deviations from typical system behaviour. Through detailed numerical analyses, we demonstrate that these outliers correspond to divergent ecological regimes associated with specific mobility values, providing also a robust manner to infer the mobility parameter from observed numerical data. Our results highlight the potential of recurrence-based methods as diagnostic tools for analysing spatial ecological systems and extracting ecologically relevant information from their non-linear dynamical patterns.</description>

      <title>Laser micromachining of arbitrarily complex and overhang-free SiN nanomechanical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on silicon nitride (SiN) nanomechanical resonators produces an exceptionally rich variety of resonator geometries, for which there is currently no available rapid prototyping solution. Experimental advances in nanobeam, trampoline, phononic bandgap, and soft-clamping structures all rely on conventional nanofabrication involving e-beam or photolithography, followed by various etching steps. These techniques are typically time-consuming, relatively inflexible, and often result in spurious residual SiN overhang that can degrade mechanical quality factors. In contrast, recent work has shown that simple resonant structures, such as nanobeams, can be prototyped by direct laser ablation of free-standing SiN membranes using a spatially distributed sequence of microholes that limits stress concentration. However, these early demonstrations were restricted to basic shapes, created by manually combining ablation routines for circles and straight lines. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of arbitrarily complex geometries using an open-source software toolset--released with this publication--that automatically generates laser-ablated hole sequences directly from standard semiconductor layout files (i.e., GDSII). The software includes a layout alignment tool that compensates for the membrane orientation and dimensional variations, limiting material overhang to ~2 um. Using this toolset, we fabricate several resonator geometries, each in under 1 hour, two of which are exhaustively characterized as candidate structures for high-performance radiation sensing. The measured quality factors of these structures closely match finite element simulations and reach values up to 3.7 x 10^6. From these measurements, we extract material quality factors above 3700, which is on par with low-stress SiN unablated plain membranes and with comparable structures produced using conventional fabrication methods.</description>

      <title>Effects of the thin-film thickness on superconducting NbTi microwave resonators for on-chip cryogenic thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators have recently gained a primary importance in the development of cryogenic applications, such as circuit quantum electrodynamics, electron spin resonance spectroscopy and particles detection for high-energy physics and astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the influence of the film thickness on the temperature response of microfabricated Nb50Ti50 superconducting resonators. S-shaped split ring resonators (S-SRRs), 20 nm to 150 nm thick, are designed to be electromagnetically coupled with standard Cu coplanar waveguides (CPWs) and their microwave properties are characterized at temperatures below 10 K. The combined contributions of the kinetic inductance LK(T) increase and the decreasing loaded quality factor QL, for thinner films, induce an optimum condition on the temperature sensitivity and resolution of the resonators. A noise equivalent temperature (NET) as low as 0.5 uK/Hz^(1/2), at 1 Hz, is reported for 100 nm thick resonators at 4.2 K. We also asses the possibility of implementing a multiplexed frequency readout, allowing for the simultaneous temperature tracking of several sensors along a single CPW. Such results demonstrate the possibility to perform a distributed cryogenic temperature monitoring, with a sub-mK resolution. Thus, the application of superconducting S-SRRs, eventually benefiting from an even higher LK(T), for a further miniaturization, as well as a back-end integration directly on-chip, can be envisioned for the accurate monitoring of localized temperature of devices operating in cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Electron-Mediated Voltage-Controlled Exchange Coupling in Perpendicular Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-mediated voltage control of exchange coupling (EM-VCEC) has been proposed as a mechanism for magnetization switching via modulation of spin-dependent electron reflection. However, its experimental verification has been challenging due to the coexistence of slower, voltage-induced ionic effects. Here, we fabricate magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices that enable nanosecond timescale voltage application. Our results reveal rapid exchange coupling modulation on the nanosecond timescale, consistent with an electronic origin. The observed enhancement and saturation at low temperatures further rule out ionic migration, conclusively confirming the electronic nature of the mechanism. These results establish EM-VCEC as a viable mechanism for fast and energy-efficient voltage-driven magnetic switching.</description>

      <title>Step-by-step design guide of a cryogenic three-axis vector magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tunable magnetic field at low temperatures is essential for numerous applications, including spintronics, magnetic resonance imaging, and condensed matter physics. While commercial superconducting vector magnets are available, they are complex, expensive, and often not adaptable to specific experimental needs. As a result, simple in-house designs are often being used in research environments. However, no comprehensive step-by-step guide for their construction currently exists. In this work, we provide a detailed manual for designing and building a cryogenically compatible three-axis vector magnet. The system is tested at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator at temperatures ranging from 15 mK to 4 K, with no significant increase in base temperature. Safety measures are implemented to mitigate heating from quenching. The coils are successfully driven with DC currents as high as 3 A, generating magnetic fields of up to 2.5 T in the bobbin's bore and 0.4 T at the sample position. Magnetic field measurements using Hall sensors demonstrate good agreement with the predictions of the designed performance.</description>

      <title>Compact vacuum levitation and control platform with a single 3D-printed fiber lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Levitated dielectric particles in a vacuum have emerged as a new platform in quantum science, with applications ranging from precision acceleration and force sensing to testing quantum physics beyond the microscopic domain. Traditionally, particle levitation relies on optical tweezers formed by tightly focused laser beams, which typically require multiple bulk optical elements aligned in free space, limiting robustness and scalability of the system. To address these challenges, we employ a single optical fiber equipped with a high numerical aperture (NA) lens directly printed onto the fiber facet. This enables a compact yet robust optical levitation and detection system composed entirely of fiber-based components, eliminating the need for complex alignment. The high NA of the printed lens allows stable single-beam trapping of a dielectric nanoparticle in a vacuum, even while the fiber is in controlled motion. The high NA also allows for collecting scattered light from the particle with excellent collection efficiency, thus enabling efficient detection and feedback stabilization of the particle's motion. Our platform paves the way for practical and portable sensors based on levitated particles and provides simple yet elegant solutions to complex experiments requiring the integration of levitated particles.</description>
