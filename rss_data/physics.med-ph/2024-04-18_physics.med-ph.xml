      <title>Reconstruction of the local contractility of the cardiac muscle from deficient apparent kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active solids are a large class of materials, including both living soft tissues and artificial matter, that share the ability to undergo strain even in absence of external loads. While in engineered materials the actuation is typically designed a priori, in natural materials it is an unknown of the problem. In such a framework, the identification of inactive regions in active materials is of particular interest. An example of paramount relevance is cardiac mechanics and the assessment of regions of the cardiac muscle with impaired contractility. The impossibility to measure the local active forces directly, suggests us to develop a novel methodology exploiting kinematic data from clinical images by a variational approach to reconstruct the local contractility in the cardiac muscle. Introducing a suitable cost functional and effective regularization methods, we minimize the discrepancy between observed and simulated displacement and we recover the contractility map of the muscle. Numerical experiments, including severe conditions with added noise to model uncertainties, and data knowledge limited to the boundary, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Unlike other methods, we provide a spatially continuous recovery of the contractility map at a low computational cost.</description>

      <title>PyTomography: A Python Library for Quantitative Medical Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: There is an absence of open-source libraries in emission tomography that (i) use modern and popular backend code to encourage community contributions and (ii) offer support for the multitude of reconstruction algorithms available in recent literature, such as those that employ artificial intelligence. Purpose: To create and evaluate a GPU-accelerated, open-source, and user-friendly image reconstruction library, designed to serve as a central platform for the development, validation, and deployment of various tomographic reconstruction algorithms. Methods: PyTomography was developed using Python and inherits the GPU-accelerated functionality of PyTorch and parallelproj for fast computations. Its flexible and modular design decouples the system matrix from reconstruction algorithms, simplifying the process of integrating new imaging modalities using various python tools. Results: Example use cases demonstrate the software capabilities in parallel hole SPECT and listmode PET imaging. Use of the OSEM, BSREM, KEM, and DIPRecon reconstruction algorithms are explored. System matrices incorporating breathing-motion correction are explored in SPECT imaging. PyTomography is validated against alternative vendor/open source software for OSEM based reconstruction. Conclusions: We have developed and publicly shared PyTomography, a highly optimized and user-friendly software for medical image reconstruction, with a class hierarchy that fosters the development of novel imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Proton-CAT: a Novel Strategy for Enhanced Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02760v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nitrogen-targeting-Proton-Carbon-Alpha-Therapy method, abbreviated as Proton-CAT, which partially converts protons into carbon-12 and $\alpha$ particles through nuclear reactions between protons and nitrogen-15. Monte Carlo simulations validated the effectiveness of the Proton-CAT, and the study specifically focused on the distribution of relative energy deposition. The results indicated that the presence of nitrogen-15 enhanced the maximum dose level of protons, resulting in more effective damage confined to tumor cells. Statistical analysis of secondary ions has shown that the Proton-CAT significantly increases the production efficiencies of carbon-12 and $\alpha$ particles. Furthermore, it has been revealed that elevating the nitrogen-15 concentration significantly boosts the dose of carbon and $\alpha$ particles within the tumor region. The present work would contribute to the future development of proton therapy.</description>
