      <title>FPT-Approximability of Stable Matching Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parameterized approximability of three optimization problems related to stable matching: (1) Min-BP-SMI: Given a stable marriage instance and a number k, find a size-at-least-k matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (2) Min-BP-SRI: Given a stable roommates instance, find a matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (3) Max-SMTI: Given a stable marriage instance with preferences containing ties, find a maximum-size stable matching.
  The first two problems are known to be NP-hard to approximate to any constant factor and W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$, making the existence of an EPTAS or FPT-algorithms unlikely. We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\beta$. This means that unless FPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\beta$. The last problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33 and W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and present an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter "number of agents with ties".</description>

      <title>Contested Route Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of routing for logistics purposes, in a contested environment where an adversary attempts to disrupt the vehicle along the chosen route. We construct a game-theoretic model that captures the problem of optimal routing in such an environment. While basic robust deterministic routing plans are already challenging to devise, they tend to be predictable, which can limit their effectiveness. By introducing calculated randomness via modeling the route planning process as a two-player zero-sum game, we compute immediately deployable plans that are diversified and harder to anticipate. Although solving the game exactly is intractable in theory, our use of the double-oracle framework enables us to achieve computation times on the order of seconds, making the approach operationally viable. In particular, the framework is modular enough to accommodate specialized routing algorithms as oracles. We evaluate our method on real-world scenarios, showing that it scales effectively to realistic problem sizes and significantly benefits from explicitly modeling the adversary's capabilities, as demonstrated through ablation studies and comparisons with baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Spatial Branch-and-Bound for Computing Multiplayer Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibria of realistic multiplayer games constitute a key solution concept both in practical applications, such as online advertising auctions and electricity markets, and in analytical frameworks used to study strategic voting in elections or assess policy impacts in integrated assessment models. However, efficiently computing these equilibria requires games to have a carefully designed structure and satisfy numerous restrictions; otherwise, the computational complexity becomes prohibitive. In particular, finding even approximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more players is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from poor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or lack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose a formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial complementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative analysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show the relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods.</description>

      <title>AlDBaran: Towards Blazingly Fast State Commitments for Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental basis for maintaining integrity within contemporary blockchain systems is provided by authenticated databases. Our analysis indicates that a significant portion of the approaches applied in this domain fail to sufficiently meet the stringent requirements of systems processing transactions at rates of multi-million TPS. AlDBaran signifies a substantial advancement in authenticated databases. By eliminating disk I/O operations from the critical path, implementing prefetching strategies, and refining the update mechanism of the Merkle tree, we have engineered an authenticated data structure capable of handling state updates efficiently at a network throughput of 50 Gbps. This throughput capacity significantly surpasses any empirically documented blockchain throughput, guaranteeing the ability of even the most high-throughput blockchains to generate state commitments effectively.
  AlDBaran provides support for historical state proofs, which facilitates a wide array of novel applications. For instance, the deployment of AlDBaran could enable blockchains that do not currently support state commitments to offer functionalities for light clients and/or implement rollups.
  When benchmarked against alternative authenticated data structure projects, AlDBaran exhibits superior performance and simplicity. In particular, AlDBaran achieves speeds of approximately 48 million updates per second using an identical machine configuration. This characteristic renders AlDBaran an attractive solution for resource-limited environments, as its historical data capabilities can be modularly isolated (and deactivated), which further enhances performance. On consumer-level portable hardware, it achieves approximately 8 million updates/s in an in-memory setting and 5 million updates/s with snapshots at sub-second intervals, illustrating compelling and cost-effective scalability.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Mean Estimation Among Heterogeneous Strategic Agents: Individual Rationality, Fairness, and Truthful Contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a collaborative learning problem where $m$ agents aim to estimate a vector $\mu =(\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_d)\in \mathbb{R}^d$ by sampling from associated univariate normal distributions $\{\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)\}_{k\in[d]}$. Agent $i$ incurs a cost $c_{i,k}$ to sample from $\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \sigma^2)$. Instead of working independently, agents can exchange data, collecting cheaper samples and sharing them in return for costly data, thereby reducing both costs and estimation error. We design a mechanism to facilitate such collaboration, while addressing two key challenges: ensuring individually rational (IR) and fair outcomes so all agents benefit, and preventing strategic behavior (e.g. non-collection, data fabrication) to avoid socially undesirable outcomes. We design a mechanism and an associated Nash equilibrium (NE) which minimizes the social penalty-sum of agents' estimation errors and collection costs-while being IR for all agents. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$-approximation to the minimum social penalty in the worst case and an $\mathcal{O}(1)$-approximation under favorable conditions. Additionally, we establish three hardness results: no nontrivial mechanism guarantees (i) a dominant strategy equilibrium where agents report truthfully, (ii) is IR for every strategy profile of other agents, (iii) or avoids a worst-case $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$ price of stability in any NE. Finally, by integrating concepts from axiomatic bargaining, we demonstrate that our mechanism supports fairer outcomes than one which minimizes social penalty.</description>

      <title>Constant-Approximate and Constant-Strategyproof Two-Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study deterministic mechanisms for the two-facility location problem. Given the reported locations of n agents on the real line, such a mechanism specifies where to build the two facilities. The single-facility variant of this problem admits a simple strategyproof mechanism that minimizes social cost. For two facilities, however, it is known that any strategyproof mechanism is $\Omega(n)$-approximate. We seek to circumvent this strong lower bound by relaxing the problem requirements. Following other work in the facility location literature, we consider a relaxed form of strategyproofness in which no agent can lie and improve their outcome by more than a constant factor. Because the aforementioned $\Omega(n)$ lower bound generalizes easily to constant-strategyproof mechanisms, we introduce a second relaxation: Allowing the facilities (but not the agents) to be located in the plane. Our first main result is a natural mechanism for this relaxation that is constant-approximate and constant-strategyproof. A characteristic of this mechanism is that a small change in the input profile can produce a large change in the solution. Motivated by this observation, and also by results in the facility reallocation literature, our second main result is a constant-approximate, constant-strategyproof, and Lipschitz continuous mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Contextual Online Learning Theory of Brokerage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the role of contextual information in the online learning problem of brokerage between traders. In this sequential problem, at each time step, two traders arrive with secret valuations about an asset they wish to trade. The learner (a broker) suggests a trading (or brokerage) price based on contextual data about the asset and the market conditions. Then, the traders reveal their willingness to buy or sell based on whether their valuations are higher or lower than the brokerage price. A trade occurs if one of the two traders decides to buy and the other to sell, i.e., if the broker's proposed price falls between the smallest and the largest of their two valuations. We design algorithms for this problem and prove optimal theoretical regret guarantees under various standard assumptions.</description>

      <title>A Market for Accuracy: Classification under Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models play a key role for service providers looking to gain market share in consumer markets. However, traditional learning approaches do not take into account the existence of additional providers, who compete with each other for consumers. Our work aims to study learning in this market setting, as it affects providers, consumers, and the market itself. We begin by analyzing such markets through the lens of the learning objective, and show that accuracy cannot be the only consideration. We then propose a method for classification under competition, so that a learner can maximize market share in the presence of competitors. We show that our approach benefits the providers as well as the consumers, and find that the timing of market entry and model updates can be crucial. We display the effectiveness of our approach across a range of domains, from simple distributions to noisy datasets, and show that the market as a whole remains stable by converging quickly to an equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Competitive Algorithms for Multi-Agent Ski-Rental Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-agent ski-rental problem that generalizes the classical ski-rental dilemma to a group setting where agents incur individual and shared costs. In our model, each agent can either rent at a fixed daily cost, or purchase a pass at an individual cost, with an additional third option of a discounted group pass available to all. We consider scenarios in which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop out of the decision process. To address this problem from different perspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall, state-dependent, and individual rational. For each objective, we design and analyze optimal deterministic and randomized policies. Our deterministic policies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic states, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from tailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric policies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric ones. Our results provide competitive ratio upper and lower bounds and extend classical ski-rental insights to multi-agent settings, highlighting both theoretical and practical implications for group decision-making under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Smooth Games of Configuration in the Linear-Quadratic Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory offers a toolbox for formalizing and solving for both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies in multi-agent scenarios. However, the optimal configuration of such games remains largely unexplored. While there is existing literature on the parametrization of dynamic games, little research examines this parametrization from a strategic perspective where each agent's configuration choice is influenced by the decisions of others. In this work, we introduce the concept of a game of configuration, providing a framework for the strategic fine-tuning of differential games. We define a game of configuration as a two-stage game within the setting of finite-horizon, affine-quadratic, AQ, differential games. In the first stage, each player chooses their corresponding configuration parameter, which will impact their dynamics and costs in the second stage. We provide the subgame perfect solution concept and a method for computing first stage cost gradients over the configuration space. This then allows us to formulate a gradient-based method for searching for local solutions to the configuration game, as well as provide necessary conditions for equilibrium configurations over their downstream (second stage) trajectories. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in example AQ systems, both zero-sum and general-sum.</description>

      <title>Oranits: Mission Assignment and Task Offloading in Open RAN-based ITS using Metaheuristic and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore mission assignment and task offloading in an Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN)-based intelligent transportation system (ITS), where autonomous vehicles leverage mobile edge computing for efficient processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach. First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm, namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and 12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient task processing in dynamic ITS environments.</description>
