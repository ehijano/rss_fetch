      <title>Effective Gauge Fields and Topological Band Structures in Pilot-Wave Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that pilot-wave hydrodynamics provides a macroscopic platform for realizing band-structure physics, topological edge states, and gauge-field-induced phase shifts. We show that a submerged square lattice produces frequency-dependent transmission governed by Bloch bands. An inversion-asymmetric honeycomb lattice confines the droplet to a domain wall, revealing a hydrodynamic analog of a valley-Hall edge state. And a chiral annular structure generates an effective gauge field that produces an Aharonov-Bohm-like phase difference between clockwise and counter-clockwise orbits. Unlike conventional wave analogs, pilot-wave hydrodynamics couples a localized particle to its self-generated wave field, providing direct access to topological wave-particle behavior normally associated with quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Under pressure: poroelastic regulation of flow in espresso brewing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensory richness of coffee is widely recognised and arises from the complex chemistry and immersion in cultural practices of coffee preparation. In contrast, the physical complexity of espresso has received less attention. The multiphase reactive flow through a dissolving, elastic porous medium remains challenging to describe. Using a controlled experimental setup based on a caf\'e-grade espresso machine, we demonstrate that the interplay between elasticity and porosity governs the long-time flow rate during espresso extraction and, consequently, the concentration of solubles in the final beverage. We introduce a minimal model that captures the resulting non-linear pressure-flow relationship and propose a methodology capable of reproducing the time-dependent behaviour of the espresso brewing process. Finally, we show that dissolution dynamics play a central role in determining the temporal evolution of flow during extraction.</description>

      <title>LSTM-PINN: An Hybrid Method for Prediction of Steady-State Electrohydrodynamic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have demonstrated considerable success in solving complex fluid dynamics problems. However, their performance often deteriorates in regimes characterized by steep gradients, intricate boundary conditions, and stringent physical constraints, leading to convergence failures and numerical instabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks into the PINN architecture, enhancing its ability to capture spatial correlations in the steady-state velocity field of a two-dimensional charged fluid under an external electric field. Our results demonstrate that the LSTM-enhanced PINN model significantly outperforms conventional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based PINNs in terms of convergence rate, numerical stability, and predictive accuracy. This innovative approach offers improved computational efficiency and reliability for modeling electrohydrodynamic flows, providing new insights and strategies for applications in microfluidics and nanofluidics.</description>

      <title>Maximum droplet volume on cylindrical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum volume ($\Omega$) of a droplet that can remain attached to a horizontal fiber defines the stability limit of droplet-fiber interactions, phenomena common in nature and critical to diverse engineering applications. Existing predictive models for $\Omega$ show limitations in accurately capturing the dependence of $\Omega$ on fiber size and wettability. To address this gap, we systematically investigate $\Omega$ on a horizontal fiber through numerical simulations and experiments. A comprehensive semi-empirical model for $\Omega$ is developed and validated against both experimental measurements and reference simulations. This model establishes a new scaling under which the normalized maximum droplet volume depends solely on the contact angle and remains valid across a wide spectrum from a sub-millimeter thin fiber to the flat-surface limit, regardless of the diverse morphologies that droplets exhibit.</description>

      <title>Enhanced numerical models for two-component fluid flow in multiscale porous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-component fluid flow simulations in multi-scale porous structures often involve regions that are under-resolved at practical computational resolutions. Accurately capturing the contributions from these unresolved regions is critical. Previous studies proposed a model to account for viscous and capillary forces in under-resolved regions, showing permeability, capillary pressure, and relative permeability comparable to fully resolved high-resolution cases. In this study, we extend the model to handle diverse structures and capture detailed fluid behavior. We introduce controllable surface tension in a pseudo-potential lattice Boltzmann model while keeping interface thickness and spurious currents constant, improving interface dynamics resolution. A method is developed to capture residual fluid components smaller than cell size using local constitutive relations, including absolute and relative permeability and capillary pressure curves. Additionally, a tensorial resistivity model is implemented for heterogeneous structures such as fiber bundles, aligning resistivity along principal axes determined from the Hessian and gradient of local porosity fields. Benchmark tests, including practical rock geometries, validate these enhancements, demonstrating improved transient interface dynamics, accurate capture of irreducible fluid components, and correct directional effects in under-resolved structures.</description>

      <title>Modeling complex motility patterns for autophoretic microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking is essential for biological microswimmers to achieve locomotion in viscous environments. Such asymmetry in the swimming mechanism enables the generation of directional forces that overcome fluid resistance, leading to efficient motion and complex interactions. As synthetic analogues, autophoretic microswimmers including isotropic active colloids and active droplets exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking of a chemical field, which generates interfacial flows and drives persistent self-propulsion. Modeling these systems is challenging because the chemical concentration and flow fields are strongly coupled through nonlinear advective transport of the chemical species. In this work, we propose a new numerical framework for modeling isotropic autophoretic microswimmers whose propulsion arises solely from self-generated chemical gradients, without any imposed geometric or chemical anisotropy. The framework employs a high-accuracy pseudospectral method to solve the fully coupled advection diffusion Stokes equations, without prescribing any slip velocity model.Slip velocities emerge self-consistently from instantaneous concentration gradients at the particle surface, driving propulsion and inducing flow disturbances through a stresslet representation of force and torque free swimmers. This approach naturally captures nonlinear advection, chemo-hydrodynamic feedback, and many-particle interactions within a unified framework. We demonstrate that the model reproduces complex emergent behaviors observed in experiments, including disordered swimming at higher fluid viscosities and chemotactically guided pairwise interactions. At each stage, numerical predictions are quantitatively compared with independent experiments on active droplets, validating the proposed framework as a robust tool for studying autophoretic microswimmers.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Implicit Variational Multiscale Formulation for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations via Exact Adjoint Linearization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-implicit, residual-based variational multiscale (VMS) formulation is developed for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The approach linearizes convection using an extrapolated (Oseen-type) convecting velocity, producing a linear advection operator at each time step. For this operator, the adjoint can be written exactly. Exploiting this exact adjoint yields a systematic derivative-transfer mechanism within the VMS closure. In particular, unresolved-scale contributions enter the weak form without spatial derivatives of the modeled fine-scale velocity. The resulting terms also avoid derivatives of coarse-scale residuals and stabilization parameters. This eliminates the boundary-condition-sensitive, case-by-case integrations by parts that often accompany nonlinear residual-based VMS implementations, and it simplifies implementation in low-order FEM settings.
  The formulation is presented for a generalized linear convection operator encompassing three common advection forms (convective-, skew-symmetric- and divergence-form). Their numerical behavior is compared, along with the corresponding fully implicit nonlinear VMS counterparts. Because the method is linear by construction, each time step requires only one linear solve. Across the benchmark suite, this reduces wall-clock time by $2$--$4\times$ relative to fully implicit nonlinear formulations while maintaining comparable accuracy. Temporal convergence is verified, and validation is performed on standard problems including the lid-driven cavity, flow past a cylinder, turbulent channel flow, and turbulent flow over a NACA0012 airfoil at chord Reynolds number $6\times 10^{6}$. Overall, the convective and the skew-symmetric forms remain robust across the test cases, whereas the divergence-form can become nonconvergent for problems with purely Dirichlet boundaries.</description>

      <title>Tuning diffusioosmosis of electrolyte solutions by hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two reservoirs of a distinct salinity are connected by channels or pores, a fluid flow termed diffusio-osmotic is generated. This article investigates the flow emerging in an uniformly charged long slit whose thickness exceeds the local Debye screening length. Attention is focussed on the role of hydrostatic pressure drop $\Delta p$ between reservoirs. For a thick slit we recover the known formula for a local diffusioosmotic slip over a single wall, which is determined by the surface potential, salt concentration and its gradient. An equation for the global fluid flow rate $\mathcal{Q}$ is presented as a sum of the diffusio-osmotic and pressure-driven contributions. Although the diffusio-osmotic term itself remains unaffected by $\Delta p$, the concentration and surface potential profiles along the slit, and consequently, the local slip velocity are dramatically modified. We present an equation relating the local concentration to $\mathcal{Q}$ and employ it to derive an expression describing the surface potential variation in the slit. Since $\mathcal{Q}$ can easily be tuned by $\Delta p$, the variety of possible concentration and surface potential profiles becomes very rich. Our theory provides a simple explanation of recent flow rate measurements and shows that experimental data provide rather direct information about concentration and surface potential profiles in the uniformly charged slit. The relevance of our results for sensing the salt dependence of surface potentials is discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>Flow morphology and patterns in porous media convection: A persistent homology analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convective mixing in porous media is crucial in both geophysical and industrial fields, spanning applications ranging from carbon dioxide sequestration to contaminant transport in groundwater. Key processes are affected by convective heat transport or diffusion of chemical species in porous formations. Intense convection flow and mixing create complex, dynamic patterns that are difficult to predict and measure. The present work focuses on the use of topological data analysis, in particular, the measures emerging from the growing field of persistent homology (PH), to quantify these patterns. These measures are objective and quantify structures across all temperature or concentration values simultaneously. These techniques, when applied to classical porous media setups, such as one-sided and Rayleigh-B\'enard flow configurations, provide new insights into the system's structure, flow patterns, and macroscopic mixing properties. Using large datasets we make publicly available, comprising original simulations as well as those presented in previous works, we correlate the behaviour of the heat transport rate (quantified by the Nusselt number) with the evolution of the flow structures (quantified by the PH measures). Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the flow evolution over a wide range of governing parameters, namely the Rayleigh-Darcy number and the domain size.</description>

      <title>Multiscale filtration framework with nanoconfined phase behavior: Pore Network Modeling with Density Functional Theory calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of fluid flow in real, multiscale porous media remains challenging due to the complexity of nanoscale phenomena and the difficulty of developing upscaling methodologies. In this study, we introduce a multiscale filtration framework based on Pore Network Modeling, incorporating the effects of pore blockage resulting from capillary condensation of fluid in the nanoporous space. To accurately predict capillary condensation in nanoconfinement, we apply classical Density Functional Theory calculations along with the consideration of capillary hysteresis. The pores blocked by condensate are excluded from the fluid flow, leading to a drop in permeability of the porous space. Our findings demonstrate that the resulting permeability is strongly dependent on the geometry of porous space, including pore size distribution, sample size, and the particular structure of the sample, along with thermodynamic conditions and processes, specifically, pressure growth or reduction. Overall, the presented research contributes valuable insights into multiscale transport phenomena and facilitates the advancement of upscaling techniques.</description>

      <title>Small-scale turbulent dynamo for low-Prandtl number fluid: comparison of the theory with results of numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: During the last decades, significant progress has been made in both numerical simulations of turbulent dynamo and theoretical understanding of turbulence. However, there is still lack of quantitative comparison between the simulations and the theory of the dynamo.
  Results: We study the critical magnetic Reynolds number ($Rm_c$) and the growth rate near the threshold both in the limit of very high and in the case of moderate Reynolds numbers. We argue that in Kazantsev equation for magnetic field generation, one should use the quasi-Lagrangian correlator of velocities instead of Eulerian, as usually implied when comparing theory and simulations. The theoretical results obtained with this correlator agree well with numerical results. We also propose the explanation of the decrease of $Rm_c$ as a function of Reynolds number ($Re$) at intermediate-high $Re$. It is probably due to Reynolds-dependent intermittency of the velocity structure function: we show that the scaling exponent of this function in the inertial range affects strongly the magnetic field generation, and it is known to be an increasing function of the Reynolds number.
  Conclusions: Use of quasi-Lagrangian correlator in the Kazantsev theory gives good accordance with numerical simulations. An ideal way to compare them should be to find the correlator substituted to the Kazantsev equation and the generation properties in the same simulation. At least one has to use universal parameters independent of the properties of pumping scale. Reynolds-dependent intermittency can explain recently observed decrease of the critical magnetic Reynolds number at small Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the separation efficiency of diffusiophoresis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The separation of colloidal particles from fluids is essential to ensure a safe global supply of drinking water yet, in the case of microscopic particles, it remains a highly energy-intensive process when using traditional filtration methods. Water cleaning through diffusiophoresis $\unicode{x2014}$spontaneous colloid migration in chemical gradients$\unicode{x2014}$ effectively circumvents the need for physical filters, representing a promising alternative. This separation process is typically realized in internal flows where a cross-channel electrolyte gradient drives particle accumulation at walls, with colloid separation slowly increasing in the streamwise direction. However, the maximum separation efficiency, achieved sufficiently downstream as diffusiophoretic migration (driving particle accumulation) is balanced by Brownian motion (inducing diffusive spreading), has not yet been characterized. In this work, we develop a theory to predict this upper bound, and derive the colloid separation efficiency by analyzing the asymptotic structure of the governing equations. We find that the mechanism by which the chemical permeates in the channel, as well as the reaction kinetics governing its dissociation into ions, play key roles in the process. Moreover, we identify four distinct regimes in which separation is controlled by different scaling laws involving a Damk\"ohler and a P\'eclet number, which measure the ratio of reaction kinetics to ion diffusion and of diffusiophoresis to Brownian motion, respectively. We also confirm the scaling of one of these regimes using microfluidic experiments where separation is driven by CO$_\text{2}$ gradients. Our results shed light on pathways towards new, more efficient separations, and are also applicable to quantify colloidal accumulation in the presence of chemical gradients in more general situations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Numerical Diffusion in Aerodynamic Flow Simulations with Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are used for many air flow simulations including road vehicle aerodynamics. Numerical diffusion occurs when local flow direction is not aligned with the mesh lines and when there is a non-zero gradient of the dependent variable in the direction normal to the streamline direction. It has been observed that typical numerical discretization schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations such as first order upwinding produce very accurate solutions without numerical diffusion when the mesh is aligned with the streamline directions. On the other hand, numerical diffusion is maximized when the streamline direction is at an angle of 45{\deg} relative to the mesh line. The amount of numerical diffusion can be reduced by mesh refinements such as aligning mesh lines along the local flow direction or by introducing higher order numerical schemes which may introduce potential numerical instability or additional computational cost. Couple test cases of a simple steady-state incompressible and inviscid air flow convection problem were used to investigate whether numerical diffusion occurs when using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that rely on automatic differentiation as opposed to numerical techniques used in traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers. Numerical diffusion was not observed when PINNs were used to solve the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for the simple convection problem irrespective of flow angle. The PINN correctly simulated the streamwise upwinding, which has great potential to improve the accuracy of Navier-Stokes solvers.</description>

      <title>Bounds on dissipation in three-dimensional planar shear flows: reduction to two-dimensional problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bounds on turbulent averages in shear flows can be derived from the Navier-Stokes equations by a mathematical approach called the background method. Bounds that are optimal within this method can be computed at each Reynolds number Re by numerically optimizing subject to a spectral constraint, which requires a quadratic integral to be nonnegative for all possible velocity fields. Past authors have eased computations by enforcing the spectral constraint only for streamwise-invariant (2.5D) velocity fields, assuming this gives the same result as enforcing it for three-dimensional (3D) fields. Here we compute optimal bounds over 2.5D fields and then verify, without doing computations over 3D fields, that the bounds indeed apply to 3D flows. One way is to directly check that an optimizer computed using 2.5D fields satisfies the spectral constraint for all 3D fields. We introduce a criterion that gives a second way, applicable to planar shear flow models with a certain symmetry, that is based on a theorem of Busse (ARMA 47:28, 1972) for the energy stability problem. The advantage of checking this criterion, as opposed to directly checking the 3D constraint, is lower computational cost and more natural extrapolation to large Re. We compute optimal upper bounds on friction coefficients for the wall-bounded Kolmogorov flow known as Waleffe flow, and for plane Couette flow, which require lower bounds on dissipation in the first model and upper bounds in the second. For Waleffe flow, all bounds computed using 2.5D fields satisfy our criterion, so they hold for 3D flows. For Couette flow, where bounds have previously been computed using 2.5D fields by Plasting and Kerswell (JFM 477:363, 2003), our criterion holds only up to moderate Re, but at larger Re we directly verify the 3D spectral constraint. This supports the assumption by Plasting and Kerswell that their bounds hold for 3D flows.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and stability of neural operators for prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence poses challenges for numerical simulation due to its chaotic, multiscale nature and high computational cost. Traditional turbulence modeling often struggles with accuracy and long-term stability. Recent scientific machine learning (SciML) models, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), show promise in solving PDEs, but are typically limited to one-step-ahead predictions and often fail over long time horizons, especially in 3D turbulence. This study proposes a framework to assess the reliability of neural operator models in turbulent flows. Using three-dimensional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) as a benchmark, we evaluate models in terms of uncertainty quantification (UQ), error propagation, and sensitivity to initial perturbations. Statistical tools such as error distribution analysis and autocorrelation functions (ACF) are used to assess predictive robustness and temporal coherence. Our proposed model, the factorized-implicit FNO (F-IFNO), improves long-term stability and accuracy by incorporating implicit factorization into the prediction process. It outperforms conventional LES and other FNO-based models in balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency. The results highlight the importance of prediction constraints, time interval selection, and UQ in developing robust neural operator frameworks for turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Capillary Rise in Pipes with Variable Cross Section</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes an ODE model for a capillary rise in pipes with variable cross section and compares it to the lubrication theory model. Two key assumptions are made: (1) radius of the pipe varies with axial coordinate, and (2) pipe's convergence angle is small. The model reduction process involves the identification of critical parameters and simplifies the governing equations by neglecting higher-order terms. Under appropriate scaling, it is shown that generalized Washburn's equation for capillary rise in pipes with variable cross section reduces to the known lubrication theory model.</description>

      <title>Kinetic closure of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents a kinetic closure of the filtered Boltzmann--BGK equation, paving the way towards an alternative description of turbulence. The closure naturally incorporates the turbulent subfilter stress tensor without the need for explicit modeling, unlike in classical filtered Navier--Stokes closures. In contrast, it accounts for the subfilter turbulent diffusion in the nonconserved moments by generalizing the BGK collision operator. The model requires neither scale separation between resolved and unresolved scales nor a Smagorinsky-type ansatz for the subfilter stress tensor structure. The Chapman--Enskog analysis shows that its hydrodynamic limit converges exactly to the filtered Navier--Stokes equations, with velocity gradients isolating subfilter contributions. Validations through lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Taylor--Green vortex and the turbulent mixing layer demonstrate improved stability and reduced dissipation, benchmarked against the Smagorinsky model.</description>

      <title>Flux-controlled wall model for large eddy simulation integrating the compressible law of the wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in velocity and temperature transformations have enabled recovery of the law of the wall in compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows. Building on this foundation, a flux-controlled wall model (FCWM) for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is proposed. Unlike conventional wall-stress models that solve the turbulent boundary layer equations, FCWM formulates the near-wall modeling as a control problem applied directly to the outer LES solution. It consists of three components: (1) the compressible law of the wall, (2) a feedback flux-control strategy, and (3) a shifted boundary condition. The model adjusts the wall shear stress and heat flux based on discrepancies between the computed and target transformed velocity and temperature, respectively, at the matching location. The proposed wall model is evaluated using LES of turbulent channel flows across a broad range of conditions, including quasi-incompressible cases with bulk Mach number \(M_b = 0.1\) and friction Reynolds number \(Re_\tau = 180 \sim 10{,}000\), and compressible cases with \(M_b = 0.74 \sim 4.0\) and bulk Reynolds number \(Re_b = 7667 \sim 34{,}000\). The wall-modelled LES reproduce mean velocity and temperature profiles in agreement with direct numerical simulation data. For all tested cases with \(M_b \leq 3\), the wall model achieves relative errors of \(|\epsilon_{C_f}| &lt; 4.1\%\), \(|\epsilon_{B_q}| &lt; 2.7\%\), and \(|\epsilon_{T_c}| &lt; 2.7\%\) in friction coefficient, non-dimensional heat flux, and centerline temperature, respectively. In the quasi-incompressible regime, the wall model achieves \(|\epsilon_{C_f}| &lt; 1\%\). Compared to the conventional equilibrium wall model, the proposed FCWM achieves higher accuracy in compressible turbulent channel flows without solving the boundary layer equations, thereby reducing computational cost.</description>

      <title>Optimal navigation in two-dimensional flows: control theory and reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zermelo's navigation problem seeks the trajectory of minimal travel time between two points in a fluid flow. We address this problem for an agent -- such as a micro-robot or active particle -- that is advected by a two-dimensional flow, self-propels at a fixed speed smaller than or comparable to the characteristic flow velocity, and can steer its direction. The flows considered span increasing levels of complexity, from steady solid-body rotation to the Taylor-Green flow and fully developed turbulence in the inverse cascade regime. Although optimal control theory provides time-minimizing trajectories, these solutions become unstable in chaotic regimes realized for complex background flows. To design robust navigation strategies under such conditions, we apply reinforcement learning. Both action-value (Q-learning) and policy-gradient (one-step actor-critic) methods achieve successful navigation with comparable performance. Crucially, we show that agents trained on coarse-grained turbulent flows -- retaining only large-scale features -- generalize effectively to the full velocity field. This robustness to incomplete flow information is essential for practical navigation in real-world oceanic and atmospheric environments.</description>

      <title>A gauge identity for interscale transfer in inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local definition of interscale energy transfer is missing in inhomogeneous turbulence research. This manifests as a discrepancy between the subgrid-scale production $\Pi^{\mathrm{SGS}}$ and the increment-based transfer density $\Pi^{\mathrm{KHMH}}$. Here, this missing definition is found by identifying a gauge freedom in the spatial transport of energy, yielding the identity: $\Pi^{\mathrm{SGS}} = \int G_\ell \Pi^{\mathrm{KHMH}} \, d\boldsymbol{r} + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{J}_{\mathrm{gauge}}$. The formulations are proven to differ strictly by the divergence of the current $\boldsymbol{J}_{\mathrm{gauge}}$. Validation against the analytical Womersley solution confirms the identity to within machine precision ($&lt;10^{-14}$). The current $\boldsymbol{J}_{\mathrm{gauge}}$ is identified as the mechanism for redistribution toward compliant boundaries. Both measures are shown to converge to the unique Duchon--Robert dissipation $D(u)$, unifying the theoretical framework for non-stationary turbulence.</description>

      <title>Convolutional autoencoders for the reconstruction of three-dimensional interfacial multiphase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of convolutional autoencoders for the reduced-order representation of three-dimensional interfacial multiphase flows. Focusing on the reconstruction of phase indicators, we examine how the choice of interface representation, including sharp, diffuse, and level-set formulations, impacts reconstruction accuracy across a range of interface complexities. Training and validation are performed using both synthetic datasets with controlled geometric complexity and high-fidelity simulations of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We show that the interface representation plays a critical role in autoencoder performance. Excessively sharp interfaces lead to the loss of small-scale features, while overly diffuse interfaces degrade overall accuracy. Across all datasets and metrics considered, a moderately diffuse interface provides the best balance between preserving fine-scale structures and achieving accurate reconstructions. These findings elucidate key limitations and best practices for dimensionality reduction of multiphase flows using autoencoders. By clarifying how interface representations interact with the inductive biases of convolutional neural networks, this work lays the foundation for decoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate state compression from the training of surrogate models for temporal forecasting or input-output prediction in latent space.</description>
