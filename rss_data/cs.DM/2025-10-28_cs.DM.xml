      <title>How to see the forest for the trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major starting points of discrete optimization is the theorem of Nash-Williams and Tutte on the existence of $k$ disjoint spanning trees of a graph along with its counterpart on the existence of $k$ forests covering all edges of the graph. These elegant results triggered a comprehensive research that gave rise to far-reaching generalizations and found applications at seemingly far-fetched areas. There are well over a thousand papers in the literature, including quite a few brand-new ones. Our first goal is to enlighten some aspects and links of these developments with the hope that the melody finds its way to non-experts. But we hope that experts will also find some novelties in our orchestration.</description>

      <title>Robust Extensible Bin Packing and Revisiting the Convex Knapsack Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a robust extensible bin packing problem with budgeted uncertainty, under a budgeted uncertainty model where item sizes are defined to lie in the intersection of a box with a one-norm ball. We propose a scenario generation algorithm for this problem, which alternates between solving a master robust bin-packing problem with a finite uncertainty set and solving a separation problem. We first show that the separation is strongly NP-hard given solutions to the continuous relaxation of the master problem. Then, focusing on the separation problem for the integer master problem, we show that this problem becomes a special case of the continuous convex knapsack problem, which is known to be weakly NP-hard. Next, we prove that our special case when each of the functions is piecewise linear, having only two pieces, remains NP-hard. We develop a pseudo-polynomial dynamic program (DP) and a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for our special case whose running times match those of a binary knapsack FPTAS. Finally, our computational study shows that the DP can be significantly more efficient in practice compared with solving the problem with specially ordered set (SOS) constraints using advanced mixed-integer (MIP) solvers. Our experiments also demonstrate the application of our separation problem method to solving the robust extensible bin packing problem, including the evaluation of deferring the exact solution of the master problem, separating based on approximate master solutions in intermediate iterations. Finally, a case-study, based on real elective surgery data, demonstrates the potential advantage of our model compared with the actual schedule and optimal nominal schedules.</description>

      <title>Pinwheel Scheduling with Real Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a sequence of tasks, each with a positive integer period, the pinwheel scheduling problem involves finding a valid schedule in the sense that the schedule performs one task per day and each task is performed at least once every consecutive days of its period. It had been conjectured by Chan and Chin in 1993 that there exists a valid schedule for any sequence of tasks with density, the sum of the reciprocals of each period, at most $\frac{5}{6}$. Recently, Kawamura settled this conjecture affirmatively. In this paper we consider an extended version with real periods proposed by Kawamura, in which a valid schedule must perform each task $i$ having a real period~$a_{i}$ at least $l$ times in any consecutive $\lceil l a_{i} \rceil$ days for all positive integer $l$. We show that any sequence of tasks such that the periods take three distinct real values and the density is at most $\frac{5}{6}$ admits a valid schedule. We hereby conjecture that the conjecture of Chan and Chin is true also for real periods.</description>

      <title>An Upper Bound on the Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithms form a family of incomplete approaches to the graph isomorphism problem. They recently found various applications in algorithmic group theory and machine learning. In fact, the algorithms form a parameterized family: for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a corresponding $k$-dimensional algorithm $\texttt{WLk}$. The algorithms become increasingly powerful with increasing dimension, but at the same time the running time increases. The WL-dimension of a graph $G$ is the smallest $k \in \mathbb{N}$ for which $\texttt{WLk}$ correctly decides isomorphism between $G$ and every other graph. In some sense, the WL-dimension measures how difficult it is to test isomorphism of one graph to others using a fairly general class of combinatorial algorithms. Nowadays, it is a standard measure in descriptive complexity theory for the structural complexity of a graph.
  We prove that the WL-dimension of a graph on $n$ vertices is at most $3/20 \cdot n + o(n) = 0.15 \cdot n + o(n)$. Reducing the question to coherent configurations, the proof develops various techniques to analyze their structure. This includes sufficient conditions under which a fiber can be restored uniquely up to isomorphism if it is removed, a recursive proof exploiting a degree reduction and treewidth bounds, as well as an exhaustive analysis of interspaces involving small fibers. As a base case, we also analyze the dimension of coherent configurations with small fiber size and thereby graphs with small color class size.</description>

      <title>Contributions to conjectures on planar graphs: Induced Subgraphs, Treewidth, and Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two of the most prominent unresolved conjectures in graph theory, the Albertson-Berman conjecture and the Matheson-Tarjan conjecture, have been extensively studied by many researchers.
  (AB) Every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest of order at least $\frac{n}{2}$.
  (MT) Every plane triangulation of sufficiently large order $n$ has a dominating set of cardinality at most $\frac{n}{4}$.
  Although partial progress and weaker bounds are known, both conjectures remain unsolved. To shed further light on them, researchers have explored a variety of related notions and generalizations. In this paper, we clarify relations among several of these notions, most notably connected domination and induced outerplanar subgraphs, and investigate the corresponding open problems. Furthermore, we construct an infinite family of plane triangulations of order $n$ whose connected domination number exceeds $n/3$. This construction gives a negative answer to a question of Bradshaw et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 36 (2022) 1416-1435], who asked whether the maxleaf number of every plane triangulation of order $n$ is at least $2n/3$. We also obtain new results on induced subgraphs with bounded treewidth and induced outerplanar subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Who Should Have a Place on the Ark? Parameterized Algorithms for the Maximization of Phylogenetic Diversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic Diversity(PD)is a well-regarded measure of the overall biodiversity of a set of present-day species(taxa)that indicates its ecological significance.In the Maximize Phylogenetic Diversity(Max-PD)problem one is asked to find a small set of taxa in a phylogenetic tree for which this measure is maximized.Max-PD is particularly relevant in conservation planning,where limited resources necessitate prioritizing certain taxa to minimize biodiversity loss.Although Max-PD can be solved in polynomial time [Steel,SB,2005;Pardi&amp;Goldman,PLoS,2005],its generalizations-which aim to model biological processes and other aspects in conservation planning with greater accuracy-often exhibit NP-hardness,making them computationally challenging.This thesis explores a selection of these generalized problems within the framework of parameterized complexity. In Generalized Noah's Ark Problem(GNAP),each taxon only survives at a certain survival probability,which can be increased by investing more money in the taxon.We show that GNAP is W[1]-hard with respect to the number of taxa but is XP with respect to the number of different costs and different survival probabilities. Additionally,we show that unit-cost-NAP,a special case of GNAP,is NP-hard. In Time Sensitive Maximization of Phylogenetic Diversity(Time-PD),different extinction times of taxa are considered after which they can no longer be saved.For Time-PD,we present color-coding algorithms that prove that Time-PD is fixed-parameter tractable(FPT)with respect to the threshold of diversity and the acceptable loss of diversity. In Optimizing PD with Dependencies(PDD),each saved taxon must be a source in the ecological system or a predator of another saved species.These dependencies are given in a food-web.We show that PDD is FPT when parameterized with the size of the solution plus the height of the phylogenetic tree. Further,we consider pa...</description>

      <title>Labeling and folding multi-labeled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1989 Erd\H{o}s and Sz\'ekely showed that there is a bijection between (i) the set of rooted trees with $n+1$ vertices whose leaves are bijectively labeled with the elements of $[\ell]=\{1,2,\dots,\ell\}$ for some $\ell \leq n$, and (ii) the set of partitions of $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. They established this via a labeling algorithm based on the anti-lexicographic ordering of non-empty subsets of $[n]$ which extends the labeling of the leaves of a given tree to a labeling of all of the vertices of that tree. In this paper, we generalize their approach by developing a labeling algorithm for multi-labeled trees, that is, rooted trees whose leaves are labeled by positive integers but in which distinct leaves may have the same label. In particular, we show that certain orderings of the set of all finite, non-empty multisets of positive integers can be used to characterize partitions of a multiset that arise from labelings of multi-labeled trees. As an application, we show that the recently introduced class of labelable phylogenetic networks is precisely the class of phylogenetic networks that are stable relative to the so-called folding process on multi-labeled trees. We also give a bijection between the labelable phylogenetic networks with leaf-set $[n]$ and certain partitions of multisets.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the cop number when forbidding a minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Andreae (1986) proved that the cop number of connected $H$-minor-free graphs is bounded for every graph $H$. In particular, the cop number is at most $|E(H-h)|$ if $H-h$ contains no isolated vertex, where $h\in V(H)$. The main result of this paper is an improvement on this bound, which is most significant when $H$ is small or sparse, for instance when $H-h$ can be obtained from another graph by multiple edge subdivisions. Some consequences of this result are improvements on the upper bound for the cop number of $K_{3,t}$-minor-free graphs, $K_{2,t}$-minor-free graphs and linklessly embeddable graphs.</description>

      <title>Longest cycles in vertex-transitive and highly connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present progress on three old conjectures about longest paths and cycles in graphs. The first pair of conjectures, due to Lov\'{a}sz from 1969 and Thomassen from 1978, respectively, states that all connected vertex-transitive graphs contain a Hamiltonian path, and that all sufficiently large such graphs even contain a Hamiltonian cycle. The third conjecture, due to Smith from 1984, states that for $r\ge 2$ in every $r$-connected graph any two longest cycles intersect in at least $r$ vertices. In this paper, we prove a new lemma about the intersection of longest cycles in a graph which can be used to improve the best known bounds towards all the aforementioned conjectures: First, we show that every connected vertex-transitive graph on $n\geq 3$ vertices contains a cycle (and hence path) of length at least $\Omega(n^{13/21})$, improving on $\Omega(n^{3/5})$ from [DeVos, \emph{arXiv:2302:04255}, 2023]. Second, we show that in every $r$-connected graph with $r\geq 2$, any two longest cycles meet in at least $\Omega(r^{5/8})$ vertices, improving on $\Omega(r^{3/5})$ from [Chen, Faudree and Gould, \emph{J. Combin. Theory, Ser.~ B}, 1998]. Our proof combines combinatorial arguments, computer-search and linear programming.</description>

      <title>Induced Minor Models. II. Sufficient conditions for polynomial-time detection of induced minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Equivalently, the problem asks if there exists an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$, each inducing a connected subgraph, such that contracting each subgraph into a single vertex results in $H$.
  It is known that $H$-IMC is NP-complete for several graphs $H$, even when $H$ is a tree. In this work, we investigate which properties of $H$ guarantee the existence of an induced minor model whose structure can be leveraged to solve the problem in polynomial time. This allows us to identify four infinite families of graphs $H$ that enjoy such properties. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Barriers to Halving Algorithmic Information Quantities in Correlated Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14408v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of scaling down algorithmic information quantities in tuples of correlated strings. In particular, we address a question raised by Alexander Shen: whether, for any triple of strings $(a, b, c)$, there exists a string $z$ such that each conditional Kolmogorov complexity $C(a|z), C(b|z), C(c|z)$ is approximately half of the corresponding unconditional Kolmogorov complexity. We give a negative answer to this question by constructing a triple $(a, b, c)$ for which no such string $z$ exists. Moreover, we construct a fully explicit example of such a tuple. Our construction is based on combinatorial properties of incidences in finite projective planes and relies on bounds for point-line incidences over prime fields. As an application, we show that this impossibility yields lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret key agreement protocols in certain settings. These results reveal algebraic obstructions to efficient information exchange and highlight a separation in information-theoretic behavior between fields with and without proper subfields.</description>

      <title>Space-Efficient Hierholzer: Eulerian Cycles in $\mathrm{O}(m)$ Time and $\mathrm{O}(n)$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a simple variant of Hierholzer's algorithm that finds an Eulerian cycle in a (multi)graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges using $\mathrm{O}(n \lg m)$ bits of working memory. This substantially improves the working space compared to standard implementations of Hierholzer's algorithm, which use $\mathrm{O}(m \lg n)$ bits of space. Our algorithm runs in linear time, like the classical versions, but avoids an $\mathrm{O}(m)$-size stack of vertices or storing information for each edge. To our knowledge, this is the first linear-time algorithm to achieve this space bound, and the method is very easy to implement. The correctness argument, by contrast, is surprisingly subtle; we give a detailed formal proof. The space savings are particularly relevant for dense graphs or multigraphs with large edge multiplicities.</description>
