      <title>Congruence Preservation, Lattices and Recognizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in general algebras Gratzer's notion of congruence preserving function, characterizing functions in terms of stability under inverse image of particular Boolean algebras of subsets generated from any subset of the algebra. Weakening Gratzer's notion to only finite index congruences, a similar result holds with lattices of sets. Genereralizing the notion to that of stable preorder preserving function, we extend these characterizations to Boolean algebras and lattices generated from any recognizable subset of the algebra. Our starting point is a result with related flavor on the additive algebra of natural integers which was obtained some years ago. All these results can be visualized in the diagram of Table 1. We finally consider some simple particular conditions on the algebra allowing to get a richer diagram.</description>

      <title>Trees and spectra of Heyting algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A poset is Esakia representable when it is isomorphic to the prime spectrum of a Heyting algebra. Notably, every Esakia representable poset is also the spectrum of a commutative ring with unit. The problem of describing the Esakia representable posets was raised in 1985 and remains open to this day. We recall that a forest is a disjoint union of trees and that a root system is the order dual of a forest. It is shown that a root system is Esakia representable if and only if it satisfies a simple order theoretic condition, known as "having enough gaps", and each of its nonempty chains has an infimum. This strengthens Lewis's characterisation of the root systems which are spectra of commutative rings with unit. While a similar characterisation of arbitrary Esakia representable forests seems currently out of reach, we show that a well-ordered forest is Esakia representable if and only if it has enough gaps and each of its nonempty chains has a supremum.</description>

      <title>Initial Tukey structure below a stable ordered-union ultrafilter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering a question of Dobrinen and Todorcevic, we prove that below any stable ordered-union ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$, there are exactly four nonprincipal Tukey classes: $[\mathcal{U}], [\mathcal{U}_{\operatorname{min}}], [\mathcal{U}_{\operatorname{max}}]$, and $[\mathcal{U}_{\operatorname{minmax}}]$. This parallels the classification of ultrafilters Rudin-Keisler below $\mathcal{U}$ by Blass. A key step in the proof involves modifying the proof of a canonization theorem of Klein and Spinas for Borel functions on $\mathrm{FIN}^{[\infty]}$ to obtain a simplified canonization theorem for fronts on $\mathrm{FIN}^{[\infty]}$, recovering Lefmann's canonization for fronts of finite uniformity rank as a special case. We use this to classify the Rudin-Keisler classes of all ultrafilters Tukey below $\mathcal{U}$, which is then applied to achieve the main result.</description>

      <title>Extended multi-adjoint logic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended multi-adjoint logic programming arises as an extension of multi-adjoint normal logic programming where constraints and a special type of aggregator operator have been included. The use of this general aggregator operator permits to consider, for example, different negation operators in the body of the rules of a logic program. We have introduced the syntax and the semantics of this new paradigm, as well as an interesting mechanism for obtaining a multi-adjoint normal logic program from an extended multi-adjoint logic program. This mechanism will allow us to establish technical properties relating the different stable models of both logic programming frameworks. Moreover, it makes possible that the already developed and future theory associated with stable models of multi-adjoint normal logic programs can be applied to extended multi-adjoint logic programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey solvability of equations in wreath products of groups, and prove that the quadratic diophantine problem is solvable in wreath products of Abelian groups. We consider the related question of determining commutator width, and prove that the quadratic diophantine problem is also solvable in Baumslag's finitely presented metabelian group. This text is a short version of an extensive article by the first-named authors.</description>

      <title>Fine structure from normal iterability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that (i) the standard fine structural properties for premice follow from normal iterability (whereas the classical proof relies on iterability for stacks of normal trees), and (ii) every mouse which is finitely generated above its projectum, is an iterate of its core.
  That is, let $m$ be an integer and let $M$ be an $m$-sound, $(m,\omega_1+1)$-iterable premouse. Then (i) $M$ is $(m+1)$-solid and $(m+1)$-universal, $(m+1)$ condensation holds for $M$, and if $m\geq 1$ then $M$ is super-Dodd-sound, a slight strengthening of Dodd-soundness. And (ii) if there is $x\in M$ such that $M$ is the $\mathrm{r}\Sigma_{m+1}$-hull of parameters in $\rho_{m+1}^M\cup\{x\}$, then $M$ is a normal iterate of its $(m+1)$-core $C=\mathfrak{C}_{m+1}(M)$; in fact, there is an $m$-maximal iteration tree $\mathcal{T}$ on $C$, of finite length, such that $M=M^{\mathcal{T}}_\infty$, and $i^{\mathcal{T}}_{0\infty}$ is just the core embedding.
  Applying fact (ii), we prove that if $M\models\mathrm{ZFC}$ is a mouse and $W\subseteq M$ is a ground of $M$ via a strategically $\sigma$-closed forcing $\mathbb{P}\in W$, and if $M|\aleph_1^M\in W$ (that is, the initial segment of $M$ of height $\aleph_1^M$ is in $W$), then the forcing is trivial; that is, $M\subseteq W$.
  And if there is a measurable cardinal, then there is a non-solid premouse.
  The results hold for premice with Mitchell-Steel indexing, allowing extenders of superstrong type to appear on the extender sequence.</description>

      <title>Complete representation by partial functions for signatures containing antidomain restriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate notions of complete representation by partial functions, where the operations in the signature include antidomain restriction and may include composition, intersection, update, preferential union, domain, antidomain, and set difference. When the signature includes both antidomain restriction and intersection, the join-complete and the meet-complete representations coincide. Otherwise, for the signatures we consider, meet-complete is strictly stronger than join-complete. A necessary condition to be meet-completely representable is that the atoms are separating. For the signatures we consider, this condition is sufficient if and only if composition is not in the signature. For each of the signatures we consider, the class of (meet-)completely representable algebras is not axiomatisable by any existential-universal-existential first-order theory. For 14 expressively distinct signatures, we show, by giving an explicit representation, that the (meet-)completely representable algebras form a basic elementary class, axiomatisable by a universal-existential-universal first-order sentence. The signatures we axiomatise are those containing antidomain restriction and any of intersection, update, and preferential union and also those containing antidomain restriction, composition, and intersection and any of update, preferential union, domain, and antidomain.</description>

      <title>Rule-Elimination Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cut-elimination theorems constitute one of the most important classes of theorems of proof theory. Since Gentzen's proof of the cut-elimination theorem for the system $\mathbf{LK}$, several other proofs have been proposed. Even though the techniques of these proofs can be modified to sequent systems other than $\mathbf{LK}$, they are essentially of a very particular nature; each of them describes an algorithm to transform a given proof to a cut-free proof. However, due to its reliance on heavy syntactic arguments and case distinctions, such an algorithm makes the fundamental structure of the argument rather opaque. We, therefore, consider rules abstractly, within the framework of logical structures familiar from universal logic \`a la Jean-Yves B\'eziau, and aim to clarify the essence of the so-called ``elimination theorems''. To do this, we first give a non-algorithmic proof of the cut-elimination theorem for the propositional fragment of $\mathbf{LK}$. From this proof, we abstract the essential features of the argument and define something called ``normal sequent structures'' relative to a particular rule. We then prove two rule-elimination theorems for these and show that one of these has a converse. Abstracting even more, we define ``abstract sequent structures'' and show that for these structures, the corresponding version of the ``rule''-elimination theorem has a converse as well.</description>

      <title>AC and the Independence of WO in Second-Order Henkin Logic, Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the Axiom of Choice (AC) and the well-ordering theorem (WO) in second-order predicate logic with Henkin interpretation (HPL). We consider a principle of choice introduced by Wilhelm Ackermann (1935) and discussed also by David Hilbert and Ackermann (1938), by G\"unter Asser (1981), and by Benjamin Siskind, Paolo Mancosu, and Stewart Shapiro (2020). Our discussion is restricted to so-called Henkin-Asser structures of second order. Here, we give the technical details of our proof of the independence of WO from the so-called Ackermann axioms in HPL presented at the Colloquium Logicum in 2022. Most of the definitions used here can be found in Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Part I.</description>

      <title>A 2-categorical analysis of context comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the equivalence between the two main categorical models for the type-theoretical operation of context comprehension, namely P. Dybjer's categories with families and B. Jacobs' comprehension categories, and generalise it to the non-discrete case. The classical equivalence can be summarised in the slogan: "terms as sections". By recognising "terms as coalgebras", we show how to use the structure-semantics adjunction to prove that a 2-category of comprehension categories is biequivalent to a 2-category of (non-discrete) categories with families. The biequivalence restricts to the classical one proved by Hofmann in the discrete case. It also provides a framework where to compare different morphisms of these structures that have appeared in the literature, varying on the degree of preservation of the relevant structure. We consider in particular morphisms defined by Claraimbault-Dybjer, Jacobs, Larrea, and Uemura.</description>
