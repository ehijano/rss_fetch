      <title>FE-PINNs: finite-element-based physics-informed neural networks for surrogate modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method whereby the finite element method is used to train physics-informed neural networks that are suitable for surrogate modeling. The method is based on a custom convolutional operation called stencil convolution which leverages the inverse isoparametric map of the finite element method. We demonstrate the performance of the method in several training and testing scenarios with linear boundary-value problems of varying geometries. The resulting neural networks show reasonable accuracy when tested on unseen geometries that are similar to those used for training. Furthermore, when the number of training geometries is increased the testing errors systematically decrease, demonstrating that the neural networks learn how to generalize as the training set becomes larger. Further extending the method to allow for variable boundary conditions, properties, and body forces will lead to a general-purpose surrogate modeling framework that can leverage existing finite element codes for training.</description>

      <title>Tunable Orbital Thermoelectric Transport with Spin-Valley Coupling in Ferromagnetic Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In valleytronic devices, the valley transport of electrons can carry not only charge but also spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). However, investigations on thermoelectric transport of OAM manipulated by valley degrees of freedom remain limited. Here, using the ferromagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides RuCl$_2$ as an example, we investigate valley-contrasting Berry curvature and demonstrate its role in generating valley-dependent anomalous and orbital Nernst effects. The thermoelectric transport of OAM is shown to be modulated by intrinsic spin polarization and exhibits characteristics of valley-orbital coupling. Furthermore, we show that spin-valley coupling plays a crucial role in controlling the orbital Nernst effect and distinguishing it from the anomalous Nernst effect. Based on these findings, we propose a thermoelectric transport mechanism for generating pure orbital currents.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method for lipid membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method and numerical implementation for curved and deforming lipid membranes is presented here. The membrane surface is endowed with a mesh whose in-plane motion need not depend on the in-plane flow of lipids. Instead, in-plane mesh dynamics can be specified arbitrarily. A new class of mesh motions is introduced, where the mesh velocity satisfies the dynamical equations of a user-specified two-dimensional material. A Lagrange multiplier constrains the out-of-plane membrane and mesh velocities to be equal, such that the mesh and material always overlap. An associated numerical inf--sup instability ensues, and is removed by adapting established techniques in the finite element analysis of fluids. In our implementation, the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier is projected onto a discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The new mesh motion is compared to established Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations by investigating a preeminent numerical benchmark of biological significance: the pulling of a membrane tether from a flat patch, and its subsequent lateral translation.</description>

      <title>TAE: A Model-Constrained Tikhonov Autoencoder Approach for Forward and Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient real-time solvers for forward and inverse problems are essential in engineering and science applications. Machine learning surrogate models have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional methods, offering substantially reduced computational time. Nevertheless, these models typically demand extensive training datasets to achieve robust generalization across diverse scenarios. While physics-based approaches can partially mitigate this data dependency and ensure physics-interpretable solutions, addressing scarce data regimes remains a challenge. Both purely data-driven and physics-based machine learning approaches demonstrate severe overfitting issues when trained with insufficient data. We propose a novel Tikhonov autoencoder model-constrained framework, called TAE, capable of learning both forward and inverse surrogate models using a single arbitrary observation sample. We develop comprehensive theoretical foundations including forward and inverse inference error bounds for the proposed approach for linear cases. For comparative analysis, we derive equivalent formulations for pure data-driven and model-constrained approach counterparts. At the heart of our approach is a data randomization strategy, which functions as a generative mechanism for exploring the training data space, enabling effective training of both forward and inverse surrogate models from a single observation, while regularizing the learning process. We validate our approach through extensive numerical experiments on two challenging inverse problems: 2D heat conductivity inversion and initial condition reconstruction for time-dependent 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Results demonstrate that TAE achieves accuracy comparable to traditional Tikhonov solvers and numerical forward solvers for both inverse and forward problems, respectively, while delivering orders of magnitude computational speedups.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and fluctuations in mesoscopic stochastic simulations of reactive gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is essential that mesoscopic simulations of reactive systems reproduce the correct statistical distributions at thermodynamic equilibrium. By considering a compressible fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) simulation method of ideal gas mixtures undergoing reversible reactions described by the chemical Langevin equations, we show that thermodynamic consistency in reaction rates and the use of instantaneous temperatures for the evaluation of reaction rates is required for fluctuations for the overall system to be correct. We then formulate the required properties of a thermodynamically-consistent reaction (TCR) model. As noted in the literature, while reactions are often discussed in terms of forward and reverse rates, these rates should not be modeled independently because they must be compatible with thermodynamic equilibrium for the system. Using a simple TCR model where each chemical species has constant heat capacity, we derive the explicit condition that the forward and reverse reaction rate constants must satisfy in order for the system to be thermodynamically consistent. We perform equilibrium and non-equilibrium simulations of ideal gas mixtures undergoing a reversible dimerization reaction to measure the fluctuational behavior of the system numerically. We confirm that FHD simulations with the TCR model give the correct static structure factor of equilibrium fluctuations. For the statistically steady simulation of a gas mixture between two isothermal walls with different temperatures, we show using the TCR model that the temperature variance agrees with the corresponding thermodynamic-equilibrium temperature variance in the interior of the system, whereas noticeable deviations are present in regions near walls, where chemistry is far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Effects of Artificial Collisions, Filtering, and Nonlocal Closure Approaches on Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations of collisionless plasmas are computationally challenging due to phase space mixing and filamentation, resulting in fine-scale velocity structures. This study compares three methods developed to reduce artifacts related to limited velocity resolution in Hermite-based Vlasov-Poisson simulations: artificial collisions, filtering, and nonlocal closure approaches. We evaluate each method's performance in approximating the linear kinetic response function and suppressing recurrence in linear and nonlinear regimes. Numerical simulations of Landau damping demonstrate that artificial collisions, particularly higher orders of the Lenard-Bernstein collisional operator, most effectively recover the correct damping rate across a range of wavenumbers. Moreover, Hou-Li filtering and nonlocal closures underdamp high wavenumber modes in linear simulations, and the Lenard- Bernstein collisional operator overdamps low wavenumber modes in both linear and nonlinear simulations. This study demonstrates that hypercollisions offer a robust approach to kinetic simulations, accurately capturing collisionless dynamics with limited velocity resolution.</description>

      <title>Collision Dynamics and Deformation Behaviors of Multi-Core Compound Droplet Pairs in Microchannel Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the collision dynamics and deformation behaviors of double-core compound droplet pairs within confined shear flows using free-energy-based lattice Boltzmann method. While significant research has advanced our understanding of simple droplet pair interactions, the collision behaviors of core-shell compound droplets, where each shell contains one or more core droplets, remain largely unexplored. Even the pairwise interaction of single-core compound droplets has not been extensively studied. We address how the interplay between physical parameters (i.e., density and viscosity ratios of immiscible fluids and Capillary number) and geometric parameters (i.e., initial offset distance between the shell droplets) affects the interaction time and collision outcomes of compound droplets. Our findings reveal that the presence of inner droplets significantly influences the deformation and stability of shell droplets, as well as the collision outcomes of both shell and core droplets. We identify several distinct collision outcomes, including (i) coalescence of shell droplets, with core droplets remaining separate and rotating in a planetary-like motion, (ii) pass-over of shell droplets, where core droplets maintain separation and exhibit both rotational and translational motion, (iii) coalescence of core droplets, with shell droplets passing each other, and (iv) pass-over of shell droplets, with the coalescence of core droplets. We demonstrate that the transition between these collision outcomes is governed by varying the Capillary number and initial offset. Additionally, we observed that increasing the density and viscosity ratios from unity to larger values always results in the pass-over of shell droplets, with the core droplets remain separated and experience rotational motion.</description>

      <title>Electroelastic guided wave dispersion in piezoelectric plates: spectral methods and laser-ultrasound experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroelastic waves in piezoelectric media are widely used in sensing and filtering applications. Despite extensive research, computing the guided wave dispersion remains challenging. This paper presents semi-analytical approaches based on spectral methods to efficiently and reliably compute dispersion curves. We systematically assess the impact of electrical boundary conditions on a 128{\deg} Y-cut LiNbO3 wafer, examining open-open, open-shorted and shorted-shorted surfaces configurations. Multi-modal dispersion maps obtained from laser-ultrasonic experiments for each boundary condition exhibit excellent agreement with the computational predictions. A straightforward implementation of the spectral collocation method is made available as "GEW piezo plate" (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14205789), while the spectral element method will be integrated to "GEWtool" (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10114243). Therewith, we aim to make advanced semi-analytical techniques more accessible to physicists and engineers relying on dispersion analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present chapter we focus on the fundamentals of non-grid-conforming numerical approaches to simulating particulate flows, implementation issues and grid convergence vs. available reference data. The main idea is to avoid adapting the mesh (and - as much as possible - the discrete operators) to the time-dependent fluid domain with the aim to maximize computational efficiency. We restrict our attention to spherical particle shapes (while deviations from sphericity are treated in a subsequent chapter). We show that similar ideas can be successfully implemented in a variety of underlying fluid flow solvers, leading to powerful tools for the direct numerical simulation of large particulate systems.</description>

      <title>A finite element method to compute the damping rate and frequency of oscillating fluids inside microfluidic nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computation of damping rates of an oscillating fluid with a free surface in which viscosity is small and surface tension high is numerically challenging. A typical application requiring such computation is drop-on-demand (DoD) microfluidic devices that eject liquid metal droplets, where accurate knowledge of damping rates for the least-damped oscillation modes following droplet ejection is paramount for assessing jetting stability at higher jetting frequencies. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often struggle to accurately predict meniscus damping unless a very fine discretization is adopted, so calculations are computationally expensive. The faster alternative we adopt is to compute damping rates directly from the eigenvalues of the linearized problem. The surface tension term in Stokes or sloshing problems requires approximation of meniscus displacements, which introduces additional complexity in their numerical solution. We consider the combined effects of viscosity and surface tension, approximate the meniscus displacements, and construct a finite element method to compute the fluid's oscillation modes. We prove that the method is free of spurious modes with zero or positive damping rates, and we implement it with Taylor-Hood elements for velocity and pressure, and with continuous piecewise quadratic elements for meniscus displacement. We verify the numerical convergence of the method by reproducing the solution to an analytical benchmark problem and two more complex examples with axisymmetric geometry. We obtain the spatial shape and temporal evolution (angular frequency and damping rate) of the set of least-damped oscillation modes in minutes, compared to days for a CFD simulation. The method's ability to quickly generate accurate estimates of fluid oscillation damping rates makes it suitable for integration into design loops for prototyping microfluidic nozzles.</description>

      <title>Portable, Massively Parallel Implementation of a Material Point Method for Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17057v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent evolution of software and hardware technologies is leading to a renewed computational interest in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods such as the Material Point Method (MPM). Indeed, provided some critical aspects are properly handled, PIC methods can be cast in formulations suitable for the requirements of data locality and fine-grained parallelism of modern hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Such a rapid and continuous technological development increases also the importance of generic and portable implementations. While the capabilities of MPM on a wide range continuum mechanics problem have been already well assessed, the use of the method in compressible fluid dynamics has received less attention. In this paper we present a portable, highly parallel, GPU based MPM solver for compressible gas dynamics. The implementation aims to reach a good compromise between portability and efficiency in order to provide a first assessment of the potential of this approach in solving strongly compressible gas flow problems, also taking into account solid obstacles. The numerical model considered constitutes a first step towards the development of a monolithic MPM solver for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems at all Mach numbers up to the supersonic regime.</description>

Abstract: We derive conservative closures of the Vlasov-Poisson equations discretized in velocity via the symmetrically weighted Hermite spectral expansion. The short note analyzes the conservative closures preservation of the hyperbolicity and anti-symmetry of the Vlasov equation. Furthermore, we verify numerically the analytically derived conservative closures on simulating a classic electrostatic benchmark problem: the Langmuir wave. The numerical results and analytic analysis show that the closure by truncation is the most suitable conservative closure for the symmetrically weighted Hermite formulation.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in Materials Informatics: structure-property relationships through minimal but highly informative multimodal input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose simple, effective and computationally efficient transfer learning approaches for structure-property relation predictions in the context of materials, with highly informative input from different modalities. As materials properties stand from their electronic structure, representations are extracted directly from datasets of electronic charge density profile images using Neural Networks. We demonstrate transferability of the existing pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks and Large Language Models knowledge to physics domain data, exploring a wide set of compositions for the regression of energetics- or structure- related properties, and the role of semantic crystallographic information in the context of multimodal approaches. We test the applicability of the CLIP multimodal model, and employ as well a training protocol for building a more interpretable and versatile stacked custom solution from different pre-trained modalities. The study offers a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of descriptor identification in physical systems, shedding light on the power of multimodal transfer learning for materials property prediction. Instead of using the well-established GNN-based approaches, we explore the transfer learning of image- and text-based architectures, which can impact decision making for new low-cost AI methods in the field of Materials and Chemoinformatics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) is discovered within a wide interval in solids, however, its microscopic nature is still not transparent in most realistic materials, and the recently studied chiral ones with chiral structural distortion remain unclear. In this paper, we try to understand the driving forces of chiral CDW transition by chiral phonons from the electron-phonon coupling scenario. We use the prototypal monolayer 1T-TiSe$_2$ as a case study to unveil the absence of chirality in the CDW transition and propose a general approach, i.e., symmetry-breaking stimuli, to engineer the chirality of CDW in experiments. Inelastic scattering patterns are also studied as a benchmark of chiral CDW (CCDW, which breaks the mirror/inversion symmetry in 2D/3D systems). We notice that the anisotropy changing of Bragg peak profiles, which is contributed by the soft chiral phonons, can show a remarkable signature for CCDW. Our findings pave a path to understanding the CCDW from the chiral phonon perspective, especially in van der Waals materials, and provide a powerful way to manipulate the chirality of CDW.</description>

      <title>A Resolution Independent Neural Operator</title>

Abstract: The Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) is a powerful neural operator architecture that uses two neural networks to map between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This architecture allows for the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the domain but requires input functions to be discretized at identical locations, limiting practical applications. We introduce a general framework for operator learning from input-output data with arbitrary sensor locations and counts. This begins by introducing a resolution-independent DeepONet (RI-DeepONet), which handles input functions discretized arbitrarily but sufficiently finely. To achieve this, we propose two dictionary learning algorithms that adaptively learn continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from correlated signals on arbitrary point clouds. These basis functions project input function data onto a finite-dimensional embedding space, making it compatible with DeepONet without architectural changes. We specifically use sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as trainable INR basis functions. Similarly, the dictionary learning algorithms identify basis functions for output data, defining a new neural operator architecture: the Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO). In RINO, the operator learning task reduces to mapping coefficients of input basis functions to output basis functions. We demonstrate RINO's robustness and applicability in handling arbitrarily sampled input and output functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Diffusion in Magnesium Using Machine Learning Potentials: a comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and accurately predicting hydrogen diffusion in materials is challenging due to the complex interactions between hydrogen defects and the crystal lattice. These interactions span large length and time scales, making them difficult to address with standard ab initio techniques. This work addresses this challenge by employing accelerated machine learning (ML) molecular dynamics simulations through active learning. We conduct a comparative study of different ML-based interatomic potential schemes, including VASP, MACE, and CHGNet, utilizing various training strategies such as on-the-fly learning, pre-trained universal models, and fine-tuning.By considering different temperatures and concentration regimes, we obtain hydrogen diffusion coefficients and activation energy values which align remarkably well with experimental results, underlining the efficacy and accuracy of ML-assisted methodologies in the context of diffusive dynamics. Particularly, our procedure significantly reduces the computational effort associated with traditional transition state calculations or ad-hoc designed interatomic potentials. The results highlight the limitations of pre-trained universal solutions for defective materials and how they can be improved by fine-tuning. Specifically, fine-tuning the models on a database produced during on-the-fly training of VASP ML force-field allows the retrieving of DFT-level accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Order Based Ultra Fast Large-Scale Modeling of High-Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs) exhibit complex atomic interactions, with short-range order (SRO) playing a critical role in determining their properties. Traditional methods, such as Monte Carlo (MC) based ATAT and SCRAPs, and hybrid Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD), are often constrained by system size and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability for large-scale modeling. We introduce PyHEA, a Python based toolkit with a high-performance C++ core, designed to efficiently model HEAs through a combination of global and local search algorithms, incremental SRO calculations, and GPU acceleration. PyHEA delivers an impressive speedup of more than 333,000x and 10,000x over state-of-the-art tools ATAT and SCRAPs respectively, ensuring accurate SRO calculations with unprecedented efficiency. In practical applications, PyHEA successfully modeled a 256,000-atom Fe-Mn-Cr-Co alloy, replicating literature results and reducing computational time from days to seconds with GPU acceleration, achieving over 1,000x speedup compared to hybrid MC-MD approaches. This huge breakthrough in computational efficiency revolutionizes HEA modeling by bridging theoretical predictions and practical applications, opening new horizons for the design of next-generation HEAs.</description>

      <title>High-throughput computational screening of small, eco-friendly, molecular crystals for sustainable piezoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic molecular crystals are ideally placed to become next-generation piezoelectric materials due to their diverse chemistries that can be used to engineer tailor-made solid-state assemblies. Using crystal engineering principles, and techniques such as co-crystallisation, these materials can be engineered to have a wide range of electromechanical properties. For materials that have been structurally characterised by methods such as X-Ray Diffraction, computational chemistry is an effective tool to predict their electromechanical properties, allowing researchers to screen these molecular crystals and identify materials best suited to their chosen application. Here we present our database of small molecular crystals, and their Density Functional Theory (DFT) predicted electromechanical properties, CrystalDFT (https://actuatelab.ie/CrystalDFT). We highlight the broad range of electromechanical properties amongst this primary dataset, and in particular, the high number of crystals that have a naturally occurring longitudinal d33 constant. This longitudinal electromechanical coupling is a prerequisite for several conventional sensing and energy harvesting applications, the presence of which is notably rare amongst the literature on biomolecular crystal piezoelectricity to date.</description>
