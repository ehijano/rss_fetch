      <title>E-Graphs With Bindings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equality saturation, a technique for program optimisation and reasoning, has gained attention due to the resurgence of equality graphs (e-graphs). E-graphs represent equivalence classes of terms under rewrite rules, enabling simultaneous rewriting across a family of terms. However, they struggle in domains like $\lambda$-calculus that involve variable binding, due to a lack of native support for bindings. Building on recent work interpreting e-graphs categorically as morphisms in semilattice-enriched symmetric monoidal categories, we extend this framework to closed symmetric monoidal categories to handle bindings. We provide a concrete combinatorial representation using hierarchical hypergraphs and introduce a corresponding double-pushout (DPO) rewriting mechanism. Finally, we establish the equivalence of term rewriting and DPO rewriting, with the key property that the combinatorial representation absorbs the equations of the symmetric monoidal category.</description>

      <title>The Morse complex is an $\infty$-functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide two versions of the statement in the title. First, when the source is the category of smooth manifolds, we construct a simplicial map to a weak Kan complex whose objects are A-infinity coalgebras. Second, when the source is the category of compact Lie groups (or more generally, compact Lie monoids), the target is a weak Kan complex whose objects consist in $f$-bialgebras, as defined in [CHM24]. We also establish a statement describing module structures induced by group actions, as conjectured in [CHM24].</description>

      <title>Gray products of diagrammatic $(\infty, n)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each $n \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$, diagrammatic sets admit a model structure whose fibrant objects are the diagrammatic $(\infty, n)$- categories. They also support a notion of Gray product given by the Day convolution of a monoidal structure on their base category. The goal of this article is to show that the model structures are monoidal with respect to the Gray product. On the way to the result, we also prove that the Gray product of any cell and an equivalence is again an equivalence. Finally, we show that tensoring on the left or the right with the walking equivalence is a functorial cylinder for the model structures, and that the functor sending a diagrammatic set to its opposite is a Quillen self-equivalence.</description>

      <title>The formal theory of relative monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of relative monads and relative adjunctions in a virtual equipment, extending the theory of monads and adjunctions in a 2-category. The theory of relative comonads and relative coadjunctions follows by duality. While some aspects of the theory behave analogously to the non-relative setting, others require new insights. In particular, the universal properties that define the algebra object and the opalgebra object for a monad in a virtual equipment are stronger than the classical notions of algebra object and opalgebra object for a monad in a 2-category. Inter alia, we prove a number of representation theorems for relative monads, establishing the unity of several concepts in the literature, including the devices of Walters, the $j$-monads of Diers, and the relative monads of Altenkirch, Chapman, and Uustalu. A motivating setting is the virtual equipment $\mathbb{V}\text{-}\mathbf{Cat}$ of categories enriched in a monoidal category $\mathbb{V}$, though many of our results are new even for $\mathbb{V} = \mathbf{Set}$.</description>

      <title>Colimits of internal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for an extensive $1$-category $\mathcal{E}$ with pullbacks and pullback stable coequalisers in which the forgetful functor $\mathcal{U}: \mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})_1 \to \mathbf{Gph}(\E)$ has left adjoint, the $2$-category $\mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})$ of internal categories, functors and natural transformations has finite $2$-colimits. In addition, $\mathbf{Cat}(\mathcal{E})$ is extensive, has pullbacks and codescent coequalisers are stable under pullback along discrete Conduch\'{e} fibrations. We show converse results to this, including a restriction of the assumptions for $\E$ an arithmetic $\Pi$-pretopos.</description>

      <title>The Club Sandwich: Gapless Phases and Phase Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a generalization of the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework to characterize phase transitions and gapless phases with categorical symmetries. The central tool is the club sandwich, which extends the SymTFT setup to include an interface between two topological orders: there is a symmetry boundary, which is gapped, and a physical boundary that may be gapless, but in addition, there is also a gapped interface in the middle. The club sandwich generalizes so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. Building on the results in [1, 2] on gapped phases with categorical symmetries, we construct gapless theories describing phase transitions with non-invertible symmetries by applying suitable KT transformations on known phase transitions provided by the critical Ising model and the 3-state Potts model. We also describe in detail the order parameters in these gapless theories characterizing the phase transitions, which are generally mixtures of conventional and string-type order parameters mixed together by the action of categorical symmetries. Additionally, removing the physical boundary from the club sandwiches results in club quiches, which characterize all possible gapped boundary phases with (possibly non-invertible) symmetries that can arise on the boundary of a bulk gapped phase. We also provide a mathematical characterization of gapped boundary phases with symmetries as pivotal tensor functors whose targets are pivotal multi-fusion categories.</description>
