      <title>Dynamical systems on torus related to general Heun equations: phase-lock areas and constriction breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity is modeled by a family of dynamical systems on two-dimensional torus: the so-called RSJ model. As was discovered by V.M.Buchstaber and S.I.Tertychnyi, this family admits an equivalent description by a family of second order differential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present paper we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be equivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four singular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The first family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be denoted by dRSJ. The {\it phase-lock areas} of a family of dynamical systems on torus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have non-empty interiors. For the RSJ model, V.M.Buchstaber, O.V.Karpov and S.I.~Tertychnyi discovered the Rotation Number Quantization Effect: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation number values. As was shown by A.V.~Klimenko and O.L.~Romaskevich, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated by points. Those separation points that do not lie in the abscissa axis are called {\it constrictions}. In the present paper we study phase-lock areas in the new family dRSJ. The Quantization Effect remains valid in this family. On the other hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.</description>

      <title>Exact renormalisation for patch frequencies in inflation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note provides an explicit way of calculating the patch frequencies in geometric realisations of primitive substitutions using exact renormalisation relations. Further, we profit from these results to obtain the patch frequencies in the symbolic case as well as in other suspensions (under mild assumptions on the substitution). We illustrate this procedure on the Fibonacci example.</description>

      <title>Induced Topological Pressure for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of induced topological pressure, including both classical and nonlinear cases. For the classical induced topological pressure, we investigate equilibrium states, subdifferential and freezing states, while also discussing some basic properties of it. Additionally, the high dimensional nonlinear induced topological pressure is introduced, and the corresponding variational principle is established.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parametric SVD of Koopman Operator for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a non-atomic self-similar measure on $\mathbb{R}$, and let $\nu$ be its pushforward to a non-degenerate curve in $\mathbb{R}^d, d\geq 1$. We show that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there is $p&gt;1$, so that $\left \lVert \hat{\nu} \right \rVert_{L^p(B(R))}^p = O_\epsilon(R^\epsilon)$ for all $R&gt;1$, where $B(R)$ is the $R$-ball about the origin. As a corollary, we show that convolution with $\nu$ quantitatively improves $L^2$-dimension.</description>

      <title>Way More Than the Sum of Their Parts: From Statistical to Structural Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much more structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely more complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical mixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent hierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural complexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad consequences for system ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Turing complete Navier-Stokes steady states via cosymplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct stationary solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations on certain Riemannian $3$-manifolds that exhibit Turing completeness, in the sense that they are capable of performing universal computation. This universality arises on manifolds admitting nonvanishing harmonic 1-forms, thus showing that computational universality is not obstructed by viscosity, provided the underlying geometry satisfies a mild cohomological condition. The proof makes use of a correspondence between nonvanishing harmonic $1$-forms and cosymplectic geometry, which extends the classical correspondence between Beltrami fields and Reeb flows on contact manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hyper-u-amenablity and Hyperfiniteness of Treeable Equivalence Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of u-amenability and hyper-u-amenability for countable Borel equivalence relations, strong forms of amenability that are implied by hyperfiniteness. We show that treeable, hyper-u-amenable countable Borel equivalence relations are hyperfinite. One of the corollaries that we get is that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is measure-hyperfinite and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a free continuous action of a free group (with $k \ge 2$ or $k = \infty$ generators) on a $\sigma$-compact Polish space, then it is hyperfinite. We also obtain that if a countable Borel equivalence relation is treeable and equal to the orbit equivalence relation of a Borel action of an amenable group on a standard Borel space, or if it is treeable, amenable and Borel bounded, then it is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>On-Manifold Low-Thrust Maneuvering of Quasi-Periodic Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bi-level optimal control framework is introduced to solve the low-thrust re-phasing problem on quasi-periodic invariant tori in multi-body environments where deviations away from the torus during maneuver are considered unsafe or irresponsible. It is shown for a large class of mechanical systems that conformity to the torus manifold during periods of non-zero control input is infeasible. The most feasible trajectories on the torus surface are generated through the minimization of fictitious control input in the torus space using phase space control variables mapped via the torus function. These reference trajectories are then transitioned to the phase space both through a minimum tracking error homotopy and minimum time patched solutions. Results are compared to torus agnostic low-thrust transfers using measures of fuel consumption, cumulative torus error, and coast time spent on the torus during maneuver. Modifications to the framework are made for the inclusion of quasi-periodically forced dynamical systems. Lastly, minimum time recovery trajectories with free final torus conditions expose the disparity between the proposed framework and torus agnostic approaches. Examples are drawn from the circular and elliptical restricted three-body problems.</description>

      <title>Solving the cohomological equation for locally hamiltonian flows, part II -- global obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuing the research initiated in \cite{Fr-Ki2}, we study the existence of solutions and their regularity for the cohomological equations $X u=f$ for locally Hamiltonian flows (determined by the vector field $X$) on a compact surface $M$ of genus $g\geq 1$. We move beyond the case studied so far by Forni in \cite{Fo1,Fo3}, when the flow is minimal over the entire surface and the function $f$ satisfies some Sobolev regularity conditions. We deal with the flow restricted to any its minimal component and any smooth function $f$ whenever the flow satisfies the Full Filtration Diophantine Condition (FFDC) (this is a full measure condition). The main goal of this article is to quantify optimal regularity of solutions. For this purpose we construct a family of invariant distributions $\mathfrak{F}_{\bar t}$, $\bar{t}\in\mathscr{TF}^*$ that play the roles of the Forni's invariant distributions introduced in \cite{Fo1,Fo3} by using the language of translation surfaces. The distributions $\mathfrak{F}_{\bar t}$ are global in nature (as emphasized in the title of the article), unlike the distributions $\mathfrak{d}^k_{\sigma,j}$, $(\sigma,k,j)\in\mathscr{TD}$ and $\mathfrak{C}^k_{\sigma,l}$, $(\sigma,k,l)\in\mathscr{TC}$ introduced in \cite{Fr-Ki2}, which are defined locally. All three families are used to determine the optimal regularity of the solutions for the cohomological equation, see Theorem 1.1 and 1.2. As a by-product, we also obtained, interesting in itself, a spectral result (Theorem 1.3) for the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle acting on functional spaces arising naturally at the transition to the first-return map.</description>

      <title>Random walk based snapshot clustering for detecting community dynamics in temporal networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of many dynamical systems that describe relationships or interactions between objects can be effectively modeled by temporal networks, which are typically represented as a sequence of static network snapshots. In this paper, we introduce a novel random walk-based approach that can identify clusters of time-snapshots in which network community structures are stable. This allows us to detect significant structural shifts over time, such as the splitting or merging of communities or their births and deaths. We also provide a low-dimensional representation of entire snapshots, placing those with similar community structure close to each other in the feature space. To validate our approach, we develop an agent-based algorithm that generates synthetic datasets with the desired characteristic properties, enabling thorough testing and benchmarking. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our technique by testing it on various social dynamics models and real-world datasets and comparing its performance to several state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings highlight the strength of our approach to correctly capture and analyze the dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of Jordan Recurrent Neural Network Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State estimation refers to determining the states of a dynamical system that starts from a noisy initial condition and evolves under process noise, based on noisy measurements and a known system model. For linear dynamical systems with white Gaussian noises of known mean and variance, Kalman filtering is a well-known method that leads to stable error dynamics for detectable systems. There are some non-optimal extensions to nonlinear systems. Recent work has used neural networks to develop estimators for nonlinear systems that optimize a criterion. Stability of the error dynamics is even more important than optimality. Jordan recurrent neural networks (JRNs) have a structure that mimics that of a dynamical system and are thus appealing for estimator design. We show that a JRN performs better than an extended Kalman filter(EKF) and unscented Kalman filter(UKF) for several examples. The main contribution of this paper is an input-to-state stability analysis of the error dynamics of JRNs. The stability of the error dynamics of several examples is shown.</description>
