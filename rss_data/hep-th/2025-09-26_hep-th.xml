      <title>Charged Black-Hole Binary Evolution at Second Post-Newtonian Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of electrically charged black-hole binaries and their gravitational-wave emission during the inspiral phase. Within the post-Newtonian framework, we derive the conservative and dissipative dynamics up to second order (2PN), combining Effective Field Theory and classical methods. We compute the NNLO conservative Lagrangian, LO dissipative effects in harmonic and Lorenz gauges, and provide the equations of motion, center-of-mass transformations, and the Lagrangian/Hamiltonian in ADM-type coordinates. We also obtain gauge-invariant expressions for the binding energy, periastron advance in quasi-circular orbits, and the scattering angle in unbound orbits. Our results extend previous analyses and are fully consistent with recent post-Minkowskian findings.</description>

      <title>The degrees of freedom of multiway junctions in three dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that $n$-way junctions in three dimensional gravity correspond to coupled $n-1$ strings each satisfying the Nambu-Goto equation in the smoothened background, and with sources consisting of Monge-Amp\`{e}re like terms which couple the strings. For $n\geq 3$, these $n-1$ degrees of freedom survive the tensionless limit implying that matter-like behavior can arise out of $pure$ gravity. We interpret these stringy degrees of freedom of gravitational junctions holographically in terms of wavepackets which collectively undergo perfect reflection at the multi-interface in the dual conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Exact non-Lagrangian Schur index in closed form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schur index is a powerful tool to probe the spectrum and dualities of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs), deeply related to 2d vertex operator algebras (VOAs). In this paper, we compute the Schur index in closed form for two series of non-Lagrangian theories. We explore and classify the Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories $D_p^b(\mathfrak{sl}_N,[Y])$ realized as the $SU(2)$ gauging of two AD matter theories, where we identify several infinite families with interesting central charge relations analogous to the $a_\text{4d} = c_\text{4d}$ of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ theories. We focus on $D_{N-4}(\mathfrak{sl}(N),[N-4,4])$ and $D_{N-2}(\mathfrak{sl}(N),[N-3,3])$, and compute their flavored and unflavored Schur and Wilson line indices in compact form. We also explore their large-$N$ behavior, and show that they arise as special limits of the $SU(2)$ SQCD flavored index, also analogous to the relation among the $a_\text{4d} = c_\text{4d}$ theories. We also generalize the elliptic function integration formula in the presence of higher order poles to compute in closed form the partially flavored indices of the Minahan-Nemeschansky $E_{6}$ and $E_{7}$ theories. Our results point to a universal structure underlying the residues of elliptic integrands, Wilson loop indices, and non-vacuum modules of the corresponding VOAs.</description>

      <title>Non-renormalisation of coupling constants from categorical symmetries in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the role of categorical symmetries in constraining the renormalisation of couplings in two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with Wess-Zumino term. A large class of these theories admit self-duality symmetries associated with discrete gauging and T-duality. They are generically non-conformal, but we argue that a particular coupling is protected from quantum corrections by the categorical symmetry. We give strong evidence for this claim by showing that the $\beta$-function for this coupling vanishes to 2-loop order if and only if this symmetry is present. Furthermore, in cases where the target space is a group manifold, the non-renormalisation result can be proven to hold non-perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Mind the crosscap: $\tau$-scaling in non-orientable gravity and time-reversal-invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral statistics of quantum chaotic systems are governed by random matrix universality. In many cases of interest, time-reversal symmetry selects the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) as the relevant universality class. In holographic CFTs, this is mirrored by the presence of non-orientable geometries in the dual gravitational path integral. In this work, we analyze general properties of these matrix models and their gravitational counterparts. First, we develop a formalism to express the universal level statistics in the canonical ensemble for arbitrary spectral curves, leading to a topological expansion with finite radius of convergence in the late-time $\tau$-scaling limit. Then, we focus on topological gravity and study topological recursion on the moduli space of non-orientable surfaces. We find that the Weil-Petersson volumes display non-analytic behaviour multiplying polynomials in the boundary lengths. The volumes give rise to wormholes with late-time divergences, in contrast with the orientable case, which is finite. We identify systematic cancellations among WP volumes implied by the consistency and finiteness of the $\tau$-scaling limit. In particular, the cancellation of late-time divergences requires a nontrivial genus resummation. Working in the gravitational microcanonical ensemble, we derive and resum all orders of the topological expansion matching the GOE matrix model in the high-energy regime.</description>

      <title>Geometric Building Blocks of Effective Field Theory Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-shell amplitudes are invariant under field redefinitions. Nonderivative field redefinitions have a natural interpretation as coordinate transformations on the target manifold. General field redefinitions, which may involve derivatives, can be viewed as coordinate transformations on the field configuration manifold. We present a unified perspective for the geometry of both the target manifold and the field configuration manifold for scalar effective field theories. In both cases, we identify vertices that can be used to build the tree-level amplitudes, with the property that they transform covariantly in the vacuum and on-shell limits. We identify a choice of metric on the field configuration manifold, for which amplitude expressions on the target manifold can be easily reproduced from their counterparts on the field configuration manifold. This clarifies the relation between the well-established framework of field space geometry and recent proposals for functional geometry.</description>

      <title>Supergroup Invariants and the Brane/Negative Brane Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Molien--Weyl-type formula computing generating functions of invariants of supergroups $U(N|M)$, i.e. polynomials in supertraces, which arise as gauge groups of brane/negative brane systems in string theory. We either prove or numerically verify the formula in various examples. The formula further leads to a new expansion relating finite-$N$ and infinite-$N$ indices of $U(N)$ gauge theories. We comment on its relation to Murthy's Giant Graviton expansion, for which we suggest a physical interpretation in terms of ``Koszul dual" branes and negative branes.</description>

      <title>Scalar Amplitudes from Fibre Bundle Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute tree-level $n$-point scattering amplitudes in scalar field theories in terms of geometric invariants on a fibre bundle. All 0- and 2-derivative interactions are incorporated into a metric on this bundle. The on-shell amplitudes can be efficiently pieced together from covariant Feynman rules, and we present a general closed formula for obtaining the $n$-point amplitude in this way. The covariant Feynman rules themselves can be derived using a generalization of the normal coordinate expansion of the fibre bundle metric. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach by computing the covariant Feynman rules up to $n=10$ points, from which one can obtain the full amplitudes using our general formula. The formalism offers a prototype for obtaining geometric amplitudes in theories with higher-derivative interactions, by passing from the fibre bundle to its jet bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Freelance Holography Program, an extension of the AdS/CFT correspondence within the saddle-point approximation that opens several novel directions. This framework generalizes holography beyond the asymptotic AdS boundary, allowing it to be formulated on arbitrary timelike hypersurfaces in the bulk. Moreover, it accommodates arbitrary boundary conditions for bulk fields, moving beyond the standard Dirichlet prescription. As part of this development, we construct a one-parameter family of renormalized boundary conditions that, unlike conventional choices in the literature, lead to a finite on-shell action. We also explore intriguing consequences of the framework, including the emergence of induced gravity and the flow of boundary conditions under holographic renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the non-linear sigma model approach to string theory with the closed superstring field theory. We construct the string field theory around the non-linear sigma model background with the patch-by-patch description. We show that our string field theory action is invariant under the gauge transformation and solves the BV master equation, thereby providing a tool to study quantum gravitational effects in curved backgrounds in small $\alpha'$ and $g_s$ approximation. We illustrate how to use our results to study curved backgrounds in $\alpha'$ expansion by studying Calabi-Yau compactification in $\alpha'$ expansion. We draw connections between Tseytlin's approach to the non-linear sigma model and the string field theoretic approach. We comment on future directions.</description>

      <title>Higher structure of non-invertible symmetries from Lagrangian descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry structure of a quantum field theory is determined not only by the topological defects that implement the symmetry and their fusion rules, but also by the topological networks they can form, which is referred to as the higher structure of the symmetry. In this paper, we consider theories with non-invertible symmetries that have an explicit Lagrangian description, and use it to study their higher structure. Starting with the 2d free compact boson theory and its non-invertible duality defects, we will find Lagrangian descriptions of networks of defects and use them to recover all the $F$-symbols of the familiar Tambara-Yamagami fusion category $\operatorname{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_N,+1)$. We will then use the same approach in 4d Maxwell theory to compute $F$-symbols associated with its non-invertible duality and triality defects, which are 2d topological field theories. In addition, we will also compute some of the $F$-symbols using a different (group theoretical) approach that is not based on the Lagrangian description, and find that they take the expected form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the limited interaction between the mathematical physics community and theoretical physicists - particularly in high-energy theory - we present a computation that is typically the first example in QFT courses but, to our knowledge, does not appear in the literature: the scattering amplitudes of the $\lambda \phi^4$ model in four-dimensional space-time, derived within the framework of causal perturbation theory. Our aim is to introduce this mathematically rigorous formalism in the most accessible way possible. To that end, we emphasize general aspects of the theory while deliberately avoiding overly sophisticated mathematics. Finally, we briefly discuss how the divergent integrals encountered in quantum field theory can be reinterpreted as issues concerning the domain of distributions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KP equation is perhaps the most famous example of a three-dimensional integrable system. Here we show that a non-commutative five-dimensional Chern-Simons theory living on the projective spinor bundle of three-dimensional space-time compactifies to a Lagrangian formulation of the KP equation. Essential to the definition of the theory is a 2-form pulled back from minitwistor space. The dispersionless limit of the KP equation is similarly described by Poisson-Chern-Simons theory. We further show that, consistent with integrability, all tree level amplitudes vanish. The universal vertex algebra living on a two-dimensional surface defect in $5d$ is $W_{1+\infty}$, and its operator products coincide with collinear splitting functions on space-time. Taking the dispersionless limit contracts the vertex algebra to $w_{1+\infty}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find complete solutions of S-matrix bootstrap equations for the scatterings of massless particles in (1+1) dimensions with A_n symmetries. We show that only three types (minimal, diagonal, and saturated cases) of these S-matrices can generate RG flows that lead to UV-complete theories, and other RG flows predicted in [11] are inconsistent with the bootstrap equations. Using these S-matrices, we derived the TBA equations and corresponding Y-systems that generate the RG flows between the IR and UV CFTs.</description>

      <title>Bigraded Polynomials for the Cohomology of Wild Hitchin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a bi-graded polynomial that encodes the cohomology groups of the wild Hitchin system of type~$A_{n-1}$, constructed using an irregular singularity (determined by an integer~$m$) and an arbitrary regular singularity~$f$. When the regular singularity is of the form~$f = [1, \ldots, 1]$, the bi-graded polynomial~$C_{m,n}(q,t)$ coincides with the bigraded rational parking function defined combinatorially, admitting a Schur expansion~$C_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda(q,t) s_\lambda(x)$. For general~$f$, the polynomial takes the form~$C^f_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda(q,t) K_{\lambda f}$, where~$K_{\lambda f}$ denotes the Kostka number. We conjecture that this bi-graded polynomial agrees with the one arising from the perverse filtration of the Hitchin fibration, or equivalently, from the weight filtration of the mixed Hodge structure from the character variety. We also give a description by using the geometry of affine Springer fiber.}</description>

      <title>Holographic Brownian dynamics of a heavy particle in a boosted thermal plasma background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have performed a detailed holographic analysis of the stochastic dynamics of a heavy quark propagating through a strongly coupled plasma moving with a constant velocity along a fixed spatial direction. To model this scenario within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we consider a boosted AdS black brane geometry in the bulk. The boost corresponds to the uniform motion of the plasma on the boundary field theory side. The presence of this boost introduces a preferred direction, leading to an anisotropic environment in which the behavior of the quark differs depending on its direction of motion. Consequently, we examine two distinct cases, namely, quark motion parallel to the direction of the boost and motion perpendicular to it. In this work we have computed the diffusion coefficient for both along the boost and perpendicular to the boost directions. We have obtained the diffusion coefficient by following the two different approaches in both the cases. These complementary approaches yield consistent results, thereby reinforcing the reliability of the computations carried out. Additionally, we derive and verify the fluctuation-dissipation relation within this anisotropic setup, confirming its validity in both longitudinal and transverse channels. Our findings provide deeper insight into the non-equilibrium transport properties of strongly coupled plasma and further elucidate the holographic description of Brownian motion in anisotropic backgrounds. Then we have moved on to proving the fluctuation dissipation theorem in this context. Finally, we proceed to holographcally compute the Butterfly velocity by using the entanglement wedge subregion duality and express the diffusion coefficients in terms of the chaotic observables.</description>

      <title>Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of Charged Static and Charged Rotating Black Holes in $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of black holes provides a profound link between gravity, quantum theory and statistical mechanics. It serves as a useful tool for testing theories beyond Einstein's gravity. In this work of ours, we investigate the newly found restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST) of charged static and charged rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity. Unlike the extended phase space (EPST) approach, RPST keeps the cosmological constant fixed and introduces the central charge $C$ along with its conjugate chemical potential $\mu$, thereby allowing the black hole mass to be consistently interpreted as internal energy. Within this framework, we derive the relevant thermodynamic quantities and analyse the temperature-entropy $(T-S)$ and Helmholtz free energy-temperature $(F-T)$ behaviours. Our results reveal characteristic features of first-order phase transitions through non-monotonic $T-S$ curves along with the swallow-tail structures in $F-T$ plots, while second-order transitions appear at critical points. To further validate these findings, we employ the formalism of geometrothermodynamics (GTD), which provides a Legendre-invariant geometric description of thermodynamic geometry. We demonstrate that the curvature singularities of the GTD scalar curvature coincides exactly with that of the divergences in the specific heat capacity curves, thereby establishing a geometric correspondence for phase transitions. This study facilitates the first systematic exploration of RPST within $f(R)$ gravity and highlights the universality of RPST in capturing black hole criticality in modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Small-$b$ expansion of the DOZZ formula for light operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic small-$b$ expansion of the Liouville DOZZ three-point structure constant in the light-operator regime $\alpha_i = b\sigma_i$ as $b\to 0$. In this limit, the exact DOZZ function factorizes into a prefactor $\mathcal{P}(b;\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)$ and a power series in $b^2$, \[ C(b\sigma_1,b\sigma_2,b\sigma_3) =\mathcal{P}(b;\sigma_i)\Bigl[1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty b^{2n}\,\Omega_n(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)\Bigr]. \] Using Thorn's asymptotic expansion of the $\Upsilon_b$-function, we derive closed-form expressions for the leading coefficients $\Omega_n(\sigma_i)$ and show that each $\Omega_n$ is a symmetric polynomial in the variables $\sigma_i$. Our expansion provides explicit perturbative corrections to the semiclassical Liouville three-point function and therefore supplies a practical tool for applications in celestial holography, in particular, for generating loop-level corrections to the tree-level three-gluon scattering amplitude using the inverse Mellin transform. We conclude by outlining these directions for further development. In particular, we highlight that a primary next step is to extend this framework to four-point amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Towards mixed phase correlators in monomial matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlators in monomial Hermitian matrix model strongly depend on the choice of eigenvalue integration contours. We express Schur correlator in case of several different integration contours (mixed phase case) as a sum over products of Schur correlators for just one type of contour (pure phase), where expansion coefficients are manifestly made from Littlewood-Richardson and Mugnaghan-Nakayama coefficients.
  Further, for pure phase Schur correlators we find concise superintegrability formulas that unify both usual and exotic cases, that before looked very different from one another.</description>

      <title>Where Non-Invertible Symmetries End: Twist Defects for Electromagnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study novel conformal twist defects in 4d Maxwell theory, around which electric and magnetic fields are exchanged. These are codimension-2 defects living at the end of topological defects for certain non-invertible global symmetries. We determine the operator spectrum of the twist defect by solving classical electromagnetic wave equations subject to a twisted boundary condition. Using techniques from defect CFT, we show that correlation functions of these defect operators factorize into two sectors: a universal generalized free-field sector, and a chiral current sector analogous to edge modes in Chern-Simons theory. In a similar setup, we also revisit the twist fields attached to non-invertible line defects in the 2d compact boson CFT. We discuss a defect 't Hooft anomaly involving a chiral $O(2)$ symmetry, highlighting its dynamical implications.</description>

      <title>Splitting the Gravitational Atom: Instabilities of Black Holes with Synchronized/Resonant Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with synchronized bosonic hair challenge the Kerr paradigm, linking superradiance from ultralight fields -- creating gravitational atoms -- to bosonic stars across parameter space. In the ''very hairy'' regime, where a small horizon lies inside a bosonic star containing most of the energy, they deviate sharply from Kerr, but their dynamics remain unexplored. We show that for such solutions the horizon gets naturally ejected from the center of its scalar environment, and observe a similar dynamics in a cousin model of BHs with resonant scalar hair, albeit with a different fate. This dynamical splitting is likely to be generic for sufficiently hairy BHs in the broader class of models with synchronized or resonant hair, but possible exceptions may exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models modify the inner-product measure to ensure symmetric position or momentum operators. We show that an alternate approach to these GUPs is to symmetrize the operators rather than modifying the inner product. This preserves the standard momentum space allowing the eigenstates and maximally localized states of the modified position operator to have a standard position representation. We compare both approaches and highlight their merits.</description>

      <title>Could regular primordial black holes be dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent proposal proposed by Paul Davies and colleagues [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111} (2025) no.10, 103512] that regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) form stable, zero-temperature remnants and could thereby constitute dark matter is critically examined. While the introduction of a fundamental length scale indeed regulates the Hawking temperature, preventing its divergence, we show that the evaporation timescale for such RPBHs is infinite. This result holds generically for analytic regular black hole spacetimes under standard adiabatic and quasi-static evolution. Consequently, RPBHs never actually reach a true remnant state within any finite time, but instead persist as slowly evaporating objects with a non-zero luminosity. When the combined emission from a cosmological population of these near-remnants is considered, the resulting radiation is found to violate stringent observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background and extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds. Therefore, low-mass RPBHs are not viable dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Planck Relics are Ruled-Out as Dark Matter by LIGO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Gravity models suggest that singularities in gravitational collapse can be replaced by bounces, leading to the formation of Planck star remnants (PSR) that survive as stable relics once the black holes evaporate to the Planck mass. Recently, we proposed that such relics can be a viable candidate for dark matter. Here we show that LIGO's upper limit on the gravitational wave background rules out a formation pathway of Planck mass relics as dark matter from Gaussian initial conditions. This leaves non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations as the only viable channel for making Planck mass relics as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Baryons as linked vortices in QCD matter with isospin asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a baryonic structure in low-energy QCD via a model-independent way using the chiral perturbation theory at the leading order, in the presence of the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, the isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$, and the electromagnetic coupling. For such a scenario in the chiral limit, it has been known that the neutral pion winds like in the chiral soliton lattice, confined within an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex of the charged pions. This structure undergoes a drastic transformation when the pion mass is introduced, i.e., both charged and neutral pions condense in the bulk, allowing two distinct types of vortices: the charged pions constitute a local ANO-like vortex, while the neutral pion configures a global vortex which is further attached to a domain wall also known as the chiral soliton. Remarkably, the ANO vortex forms a topological linking with the closed global vortex line, when $\mu_B$ exceeds its critical value as a function of $\mu_I$. The linking number has the physical meaning of the baryon number in view of the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In this sense, the linked configuration realizes a stable Skyrmion-type solution, but innovatively without the Skyrme term. We therefore propose a novel phase of dense baryonic matter comprised of such vortices, which shall play a role in the low-energy QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Complex Lies, Real Physics: The Role of Algebra Complexification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physics, Lie groups represent the algebraic structure that describes symmetry transformations of a given system. Then, the descending Lie algebra of those groups are necessary real. In most cases, the complexification of those Lie algebra is necessary in order to derive irreductible representations of the Lie algebra and subsequently of the symmetry group. In this paper, we give a precise definition of the concept and prove step by step an important result $$\left(\mathfrak{g}^\mathbb{R}\right)_\mathbb{C} \simeq \mathfrak{g} \times \bar{\mathfrak{g}}. $$ This result is used to determine the irreductible representations of the proper Lorentz group and thus the physical objects admissible when this symmetry is present. It is shown that finite representations of the proper Lorentz group are characterized by pairs of half-integers $(j_1,j_2)$, which determine unambiguously the physical object associated to the given representation. For example, the representation $(0,0)$ of dimension $1$ is called the scalar representation, it corresponds to the Higgs field, and $(\frac{1}{2},0) \oplus (0,\frac{1}{2})$ of dimension $4$ is called the Dirac spinor representation, it corresponds to matter particle called fermions. This means that the mathematical group structure determines the material content of the universe following this algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Is string field theory background independent?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String field theory is supposed to stand to perturbative string theory as quantum field theory stands to single-particle quantum theory; as such, it purports to offer a substantially more general and powerful perspective on string theory than the perturbative approach. In addition, string field theory has been claimed for several decades to liberate string theory from any fixed, background spatiotemporal commitments -- thereby (if true) rendering it `background independent'. But is this really so? In this article, we undertake a detailed interrogation of this claim, finding that the verdict is sensitive both to one's understanding of the notion of background independence, and also to how one understands string field theory itself. Although in the end our verdicts on the question of the background independence are therefore somewhat mixed, we hope that our study will elevate the levels of systematicity and rigour in these discussions, as well as equip philosophers of physics with a helpful introduction to string field theory and the variety of interesting conceptual questions which it raises.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that supersymmetry can be used to compute the BCFT one-point function coefficients for chiral primary operators, in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs with $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS boundary conditions. The main ingredient is the hemisphere partition function, with the boundary condition on the equatorial $S^3$. A supersymmetric Ward identity relates derivatives with respect to the chiral coupling constants to the insertion of the primaries at the pole of the hemisphere. Exact results for the one-point functions can be then obtained in terms of the localization matrix model. We discuss in detail the example of the super Maxwell theory in the bulk, interacting with 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs on the boundary. In particular we derive the action of the SL(2,$\mathbb{Z}$) duality on the one-point functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a self consistent framework to study the backreaction effects of particle creation in the coupled semiclassical dynamics of a quantum complex scalar field and a classical electric field in both (1 + 1) and (1 + 3) dimensional Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes. Using a general Gaussian state formalism in the Schrodinger picture, we solve the resulting nonlinear equations with Gaussian initial data, obtaining a self consistent semiclassical evolution that incorporates nonperturbative backreaction. We compute the time-dependent instantaneous particle content, current density, and electric field, defined through instantaneous eigenstates of the field modes. Comparing scenarios with and without backreaction, we find that backreaction strongly modifies the electric field and current, producing immediate plasma like oscillations and driving pronounced oscillations in the instantaneous mode occupations through nonadiabatic squeezing and quantum interference. These oscillations do not imply additional irreversible particle production the time averaged particle number remains essentially constant but they reveal the rich nonperturbative real-time dynamics captured by our self-consistent semiclassical approach across dimensions and in both Minkowski and de Sitter backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: We study the Borel plane of the topological string free energy on all hypergeometric one-parameter Calabi-Yau models close to singular points in moduli space, focusing on the location of Borel singularities and the value of the associated Stokes constants. We find in particular that in models which exhibit massless D-branes at a singular point, the central charge of the D-brane close to the singular point coincides with the location of the leading Borel singularity, and the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariant associated to the charge of the D-brane, in as far as its value is known, coincides with the Stokes constant associated to the Borel singularity.</description>

      <title>Topological Manipulations On $\mathbb{R}$ Symmetries Of Abelian Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performing topological manipulations is a fruitful way to understand global aspects of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Such modifications are typically controlled by the notion of Topological QFT (TQFT) coupling across different codimensions. Motivated by the recent developments involving non-compact TQFTs as the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous symmetries, we realize topological manipulations on global $\mathbb{R}$ symmetries via TQFT coupling in the simple context of non-compact abelian gauge theory. Namely, by inserting the background fields for $\mathbb{R}$ symmetries into non-compact TQFTs on spacetime, we study the topological gaugings. Furthermore, we explore topological defects in non-compact theories by employing the said manipulations on the half-space, which are analogous to duality defects in compact gauge theories. We examine the action of these defects on the local and extended operators, and discuss their algebra. As opposed to the duality defects, our defects act invertibly on the spectrum. To further understand their role, we discuss the way they mix with other topological defects and the resulting global symmetries. We also comment on possible applications of these ideas to the bosonic String Theory. After studying defects, we provide a detailed inspection of manipulations on $\mathbb{R}^{(-1)}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{(d-1)}$ symmetries in abelian gauge theory. Notably, we develop a novel deformation tailored for flat gauging subgroups of $\mathbb{R}^{(d-1)}$ symmetries, and provide an extension of it for $\mathbb{R}^{(p)}$ symmetries. We show that this new simple deformation captures all the topological boundary conditions of the corresponding non-compact SymTFTs as the deformation parameter is varied, which the ordinary non-compact BF coupling cannot do.</description>

      <title>The Chiral Limit of Fully Nonlinear Minimal Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 3D Anti de Sitter Minimal Massive Gravity in two regimes: a) at the chiral limit where one of the boundary Brown-Henneaux central charges vanishes and two modes become null and b) in the regime that one of the two charges is much larger than the other. At the chiral point, we go beyond the known free-theory analysis to prove that these modes decouple completely also in the full MMG Lagrangian and field equations. We also use the full action to ascertain if the interacting theory becomes infinitely strongly coupled in the neighborhood of the chiral limit, where the theory is anyway not unitary. We show that this is not the case at tree level but that a strong coupling pathology appears in loops, starting at a loop level determined by the number of external legs in the bulk Feynman diagrams. Finally, we show that there is no strong coupling problem in the second regime where, instead, the two boundary fields and the field propagating in the bulk decouple from one another.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants of a quiver with potential can be expressed in terms of simpler attractor DT invariants by a universal formula. The coefficients in this formula are calculated combinatorially using attractor flow trees. In this paper, we prove that these coefficients are genus 0 log Gromov--Witten invariants of $d$-dimensional toric varieties, where $d$ is the number of vertices of the quiver. This result follows from a log-tropical correspondence theorem which relates $(d-2)$-dimensional families of tropical curves obtained as universal deformations of attractor flow trees, and rational log curves in toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Modular invariance of (logarithmic) intertwining operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra without nonzero elements of negative weights. We prove the conjecture that the spaces spanned by analytic extensions of pseudo-$q$-traces ($q=e^{2\pi i\tau}$) shifted by $-\frac{c}{24}$ of products of geometrically-modified (logarithmic) intertwining operators among grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules are invariant under modular transformations. The convergence and analytic extension result needed to formulate this conjecture and some consequences on such shifted pseudo-$q$-traces were proved by Fiordalisi in [F1] and [F2] using the method developed in [H2]. The method that we use to prove this conjecture is based on the theory of the associative algebras $A^{N}(V)$ for $N\in \mathbb{N}$, their graded modules and their bimodules introduced and studied by the author in [H8] and [H9]. This modular invariance result gives a construction of $C_2$-cofinite genus-one logarithmic conformal field theories from the corresponding genus-zero logarithmic conformal field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a correspondence between Donaldson-Thomas invariants of quivers with potential having trivial attractor invariants and genus zero punctured Gromov-Witten invariants of holomorphic symplectic cluster varieties. The proof relies on the comparison of the stability scattering diagram, describing the wall-crossing behavior of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, with a scattering diagram capturing punctured Gromov-Witten invariants via tropical geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21013v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic law of accelerating and rotating black hole described by ro- tating C-metric, as well as holography properties in Nariai limit, which are related to Nariai-CFT and Kerr-CFT correspondence. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from spinless limit to general case, and derive the frist law based on this construction through covariant phase space formalism. Serving for potential future studies, we also reduce the model to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <title>On the Bonahon--Wong--Yang invariants of pseudo-Anosov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture (and prove for once-punctured torus bundles) that the Bonahon--Wong--Yang invariants of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms of a punctured surface at roots of unity coincide with the 1-loop invariant of their mapping torus at roots of unity. This explains the topological invariance of the BWY invariants and how their volume conjecture, to all orders, and with exponentially small terms included, follows from the quantum modularity conjecture. Using the numerical methods of Zagier and the first author, we illustrate how to efficiently compute the invariants and their asymptotics to arbitrary order in perturbation theory, using as examples the $LR$ and the $LLR$ pseudo-Anosov monodromies of the once-punctured torus. Finally, we introduce descendant versions of the 1-loop and BWY invariants and conjecture (and numerically check for pseudo-Anosov monodromies of $L/R$-length at most 5) that they are related by a Fourier transform. This edition includes statements and proofs for roots of unity of all order, even and odd.</description>

      <title>Isentropic processes for axisymmetric Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the isentropic absorption of a classical charged test particle is classically forbidden for all 3+1 dimensional stationary, non-extremal, axisymmetric black holes in any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. This result is derived purely from the near-horizon geometry and thermodynamic properties of the black hole spacetime, independent of the specific gravitational theory. We further consider the Kerr-Newman black hole in general relativity and analyse, using the quantum tunnelling approach, the conditions under which isentropic absorption may become allowed. Broader implications for the second law and extremality bounds are discussed.</description>

      <title>Proper-Time Approach in Asymptotic Safety via Black Hole Quasinormal Modes and Grey-body Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal mode spectrum and grey-body factors of black holes in an effectively quantum-corrected spacetime, focusing on the influence of near-horizon modifications on observable quantities. Employing scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields, we analyze the perturbation equations and extract the fundamental quasinormal frequencies using both the 6th-order WKB method with Pad\'e resummation and time-domain integration. Our results show that quantum corrections near the horizon significantly affect the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, particularly for low multipole numbers and in the near-extremal regime. We also verify the robustness of the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors by comparing WKB results with those reconstructed from the dominant quasinormal modes. Across all field types and parameter ranges considered, the WKB method proves accurate within a few percent, confirming its reliability in probing the impact of near-horizon physics. These findings support the use of quasinormal ringing and Hawking radiation spectra as sensitive tools for testing quantum modifications of black hole spacetimes.</description>
