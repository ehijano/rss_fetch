      <title>Crossing Numbers of Beyond Planar Graphs Re-revisited: A Framework Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond planarity concepts (prominent examples include k-planarity or fan-planarity) apply certain restrictions on the allowed patterns of crossings in drawings. It is natural to ask, how much the number of crossings may increase over the traditional (unrestricted) crossing number. Previous approaches to bound such ratios, e.g. [arXiv:1908.03153, arXiv:2105.12452], require very specialized constructions and arguments for each considered beyond planarity concept, and mostly only yield asymptotically non-tight bounds. We propose a very general proof framework that allows us to obtain asymptotically tight bounds, and where the concept-specific parts of the proof typically boil down to a couple of lines. We show the strength of our approach by giving improved or first bounds for several beyond planarity concepts.</description>

      <title>Approximating the Fr\'echet distance when only one curve is $c$-packed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One approach to studying the Fr\'echet distance is to consider curves that satisfy realistic assumptions. By now, the most popular realistic assumption for curves is $c$-packedness. Existing algorithms for computing the Fr\'echet distance between $c$-packed curves require both curves to be $c$-packed. In this paper, we only require one of the two curves to be $c$-packed. Our result is a nearly-linear time algorithm that $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximates the Fr\'echet distance between a $c$-packed curve and a general curve in $\mathbb R^d$, for constant values of $\varepsilon$, $d$ and $c$.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Distance in Subquadratic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m$ and $n$ be the numbers of vertices of two polygonal curves in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any fixed $d$ such that $m \leq n$. Since it was known in 1995 how to compute the Fr\'{e}chet distance of these two curves in $O(mn\log (mn))$ time, it has been an open problem whether the running time can be reduced to $o(n^2)$ when $m = \Omega(n)$. In the mean time, several well-known quadratic time barriers in computational geometry have been overcome: 3SUM, some 3SUM-hard problems, and the computation of some distances between two polygonal curves, including the discrete Fr\'{e}chet distance, the dynamic time warping distance, and the geometric edit distance. It is curious that the quadratic time barrier for Fr\'{e}chet distance still stands. We present an algorithm to compute the Fr\'echet distance in $O(mn(\log\log n)^{2+\mu}\log n/\log^{1+\mu} m)$ expected time for some constant $\mu \in (0,1)$. It is the first algorithm that returns the Fr\'{e}chet distance in $o(mn)$ time when $m = \Omega(n^{\varepsilon})$ for any fixed $\varepsilon \in (0,1]$.</description>

      <title>Connected Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that each set of $n\ge 2$ points in the plane in general position has a straight-line matching with at least $(5n+1)/27$ edges whose segments form a connected set, and such a matching can be computed in $O(n \log n)$ time. As an upper bound, we show that for some planar point sets in general position the largest matching whose segments form a connected set has $\lceil \frac{n-1}{3}\rceil$ edges. We also consider a colored version, where each edge of the matching should connect points with different colors.</description>

      <title>Theory and Explicit Design of a Path Planner for an SE(3) Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider path planning for a rigid spatial robot with 6 degrees of freedom (6 DOFs), moving amidst polyhedral obstacles. A correct, complete and practical path planner for such a robot has never been achieved, although this is widely recognized as a key challenge in robotics. This paper provides a complete "explicit" design, down to explicit geometric primitives that are easily implementable.
  Our design is within an algorithmic framework for path planners, called Soft Subdivision Search (SSS). The framework is based on the twin foundations of $\epsilon$-exactness and soft predicates, which are critical for rigorous numerical implementations. The practicality of SSS has been previously demonstrated for various robots including 5-DOF spatial robots.
  In this paper, we solve several significant technical challenges for SE(3) robots: (1) We first ensure the correct theory by proving a general form of the Fundamental Theorem of the SSS theory. We prove this within an axiomatic framework, thus making it easy for future applications of this theory. (2) One component of $SE(3) = R^3 \times SO(3)$ is the non-Euclidean, non-orientable space SO(3). We design a novel topologically correct data structure for SO(3). Using the concept of subdivision charts and atlases for SO(3), we can now carry out subdivision of SO(3). (3) The geometric problem of collision detection takes place in $R^3$, via the footprint map. Unlike sampling-based approaches, we must reason with the notion of footprints of configuration boxes, which is much harder to characterize. Exploiting the theory of soft predicates, we design suitable approximate footprints which, when combined with the highly effective feature-set technique, lead to soft predicates. (4) Finally, we make the underlying geometric computation "explicit", i.e., avoiding a general solver of polynomial systems, in order to allow a direct implementation.</description>

      <title>How Small Can Faithful Sets Be? Ordering Topological Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in shape reconstruction and comparison call for the use of many different (topological) descriptor types, such as persistence diagrams and Euler characteristic functions. We establish a framework to quantitatively compare the strength of different descriptor types, setting up a theory that allows for future comparisons and analysis of descriptor types and that can inform choices made in applications. We use this framework to partially order a set of six common descriptor types. We then give lower bounds on the size of sets of descriptors that uniquely correspond to simplicial complexes, giving insight into the advantages of using verbose rather than concise topological descriptors.</description>

      <title>The dual of Philo's shortest line segment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05702v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dual of Philo's shortest line segment problem which asks to find the optimal line segments passing through two given points, with a common endpoint, and with the other endpoints on a given line. The provided solution uses multivariable calculus and geometry methods. Interesting connections with the angle bisector of the triangle are explored. A generalization of the problem using $L_p$ ($p\ge 1$) norm is proposed. Particular case $p=\infty$ is studied. Interesting case $p=2$ is proposed as an open problem and related property of a symedian of a triangle is conjectured.</description>
