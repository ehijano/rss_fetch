      <title>The Structure and Formation Histories of Low-Mass Quiescent Galaxies in the Abell 2744 Cluster Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass quiescent galaxies are thought to predominantly reside in overdense regions, as environmental effects are often invoked to explain their shutdown of star formation. These longer-timescale quenching mechanisms - such as interactions with hot gas in the intracluster medium and dynamical encounters with other cluster galaxies - leave imprints on galaxy morphologies, emphasizing the importance of quantifying the structures of low-mass quiescent galaxies in galaxy clusters at $z&lt;0.5$. Using spectrophotometric data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience programs, we present the first measurement of the quiescent size-mass relation between $7&lt;\log(M_\star/M_\odot)&lt;10$ using JWST imaging, based on a sample of 1100 galaxies in the $z=0.308$ Abell 2744 galaxy cluster. The resulting size-mass relation is systematically larger and flatter than samples of dwarf galaxies in less-rich environments (low-mass clusters and groups), and has a higher scatter than similar-redshift field samples. Both "progenitor bias," where larger, diskier low-mass galaxies enter the cluster at later epochs, and a general expansion of galaxy structure from dynamical interactions could be at play. This evolutionary framework is further supported by the tentative evidence that older low-mass quiescent galaxies in the cluster are more spheroidal. The star-formation histories derived for our cluster sample imply their formation and quenching occurs relatively late, at $z&lt;1.5$. In this scenario, the progenitor population would have disky axis-ratio distributions at cosmic noon, in agreement with recent observations. While this leaves ample time for dynamical interactions to maintain quiescence and drive the observed subsequent morphological evolution post-quenching, the data disfavors an onset of quenching due to the environment.</description>

      <title>High-$z$ radio Quasars in RACS I: Selection, identification, and multi-wavelength properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-bright, jetted quasars at $z&gt;5$ serve as unique laboratories for studying supermassive black hole activity in the early Universe. In this work, we present a sample of high-$z$ jetted quasars selected from the combination of the radio Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) with deep wide-area optical/near-infrared surveys. From this cross-match we selected 45 new high-$z$ radio quasar candidates with S$_{888MHz}&gt;1$ mJy and mag$z&lt;21.3$ over an area of 16000deg$^2$. Using spectroscopic observations, we confirmed the high-$z$ nature of 24 new quasars, 13 at $4.5&lt;z&lt;5$ and 11 at $z&gt;5$. If we also consider similar, in terms of radio/optical fluxes and sky position, quasars at $z&gt;5$ already reported in the literature, the overall $z&gt;5$ RACS sample is composed by 33 powerful quasars, expected to be ~90% complete at mag$z&lt;21.3$ and S$_{888MHz}&gt;1$ mJy. Having rest-frame radio luminosities in the range $\nu L_{1.4GHz}=10^{41.5}-10^{44.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$, this sample contains the most extreme radio quasars currently known in the early Universe. We also present all X-ray and radio data currently available for the sample, including new, dedicated {\it Chandra}, uGMRT, MeerKAT and ATCA observations for a sub-set of the sources. from the modelling of their radio emission, either with a single power law or a broken power law, we found that these systems have a wide variety of spectral shapes with most quasars (22) having a flat radio emission (i.e., $-0.5&lt;\alpha_{r}&lt;0.5$). At the same time, the majority of the sources with X-ray coverage present a high-energy luminosity larger than the one expected from the X-ray corona only. Both the radio and X-ray properties of the high-$z$ RACS sample suggest that many of these sources have relativistic jets oriented close to our line of sight. (i.e., blazars) and can therefore be used to perform statistical studies on the entire jetted population at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Massive Black Hole Seed Formation in Strong X-ray Environments at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promissing pathway for forming supermassive black holes (BHs) powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at the epoch of reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, non-detection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local universe, promoting H$_2$ production and thereby potentially quenching massive BH seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H$_2$ cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^4~M_\odot$ still form by $z\simeq 15$, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches $\sim 10^{-4}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by JWST spectroscopy at $3&lt;z&lt;6$. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of $\simeq 0.01-0.1$ were already established at seeding.</description>

      <title>Modeling Dust in Galaxy Evolution Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains play a fundamental role in galaxies, influencing both their evolution and observability. As a result, incorporating dust physics into galaxy evolution simulations is essential. This is a challenging task due to the finite resolution of such simulations and the uncertainties on dust grain formation in stellar envelopes and their evolution in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). This report reviews some of the most commonly used techniques for modeling dust in galaxy evolution simulations, with a particular emphasis on developments from the past $\sim$10 years in both hydrodynamic and semi-analytic approaches. Key findings from these simulations are presented, discussed, and compared to the most recent available observations. These include the dust-to-gas vs metallicity relation, the abundance of dust within and outside galaxies, and predictions on the relative importance of various processes affecting dust. The analysis presented here highlights significant achievements as well as the limitations in our current modeling of dust evolution in galaxies.</description>

      <title>An obscured quasar census with the 4MOST IR AGN survey: design, predicted properties, and scientific goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the 4MOST IR AGN survey, the first large-scale optical spectroscopic survey characterizing mid-infrared (MIR) selected obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). The survey targets $\approx 212,000$ obscured infrared (IR) AGN candidates over $\approx 10,000 \rm \: deg^2$ down to a magnitude limit of $r_{\rm AB}=22.8 \, \rm mag$ and will be $\approx 100 \times$ larger than any existing obscured IR AGN spectroscopic sample. We select the targets using a MIR colour criterion applied to the unWISE catalogue from the WISE all-sky survey, and then apply a $r-W2\geq 5.9 \rm \: mag$ cut; we demonstrate that this selection will mostly identify sources obscured by $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{22} \rm \: cm^{-2}$. The survey complements the 4MOST X-ray survey, which will follow up $\sim 1\rm M$ eROSITA-selected (typically unobscured) AGN. We perform simulations to predict the quality of the spectra that we will obtain and validate our MIR-optical colour-selection method using X-ray spectral constraints and UV-to-far IR spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling in four well-observed deep-sky fields. We find that: (1) $\approx 80-87\%$ of the WISE-selected targets are AGN down to $r_{\rm AB}=22.1-22.8 \: \rm mag$ of which $\approx 70\%$ are obscured by $N_{\rm H}&gt;10^{22} \: \rm cm^{-2}$, and (2) $\approx 80\%$ of the 4MOST IR AGN sample will remain undetected by the deepest eROSITA observations due to extreme absorption. Our SED fitting results show that the 4MOST IR AGN survey will primarily identify obscured AGN and quasars ($\approx 55\%$ of the sample is expected to have $L_{\rm AGN,IR}&gt;10^{45} \rm \: erg \: s^{-1}$) residing in massive galaxies ($M_{\star}\approx 10^{10}-10^{12} \rm \: M_{\odot}$) at $z\approx 0.5-3.5$ with $ \approx 33\%$ expected to be hosted by starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling faint X-ray AGN populations in the NewAthena era: Insights from cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations expanded our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, yet key challenges persist in the X-ray regime, crucial for studying Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These limitations drive the development of next-generation observatories such as ESA's NewAthena. Now in phase B (preliminary design), the mission requires extensive testing to ensure compliance with its scientific goals, particularly given the uncertainties surrounding high redshift AGN. This work leverages the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to build an X-ray AGN mock catalogue and assess the performance of NewAthena's WFI. We created a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) light cone, spanning 10 deg2, with corrections to account for the limited resolution of the simulation and X-ray properties derived in post-processing. The resulting catalogue reveals a 5* overabundance of faint AGN compared to current X-ray constraints, an inconsistency potentially resolved by invoking a higher Compton-thick (CTK) fraction and intrinsic X-ray weakness, as suggested by recent JWST findings. An end-to-end survey simulation using SIXTE predicts 250000 AGN detections, including 20,000 at z &gt; 3 and 35 in the Epoch of Reionization (z &gt; 6); notably, only AGN with LX &gt; 43.5 erg/s are detectable at z &gt; 6. The analysis also forecasts a significant population of detectable CTK AGN, even beyond z &gt; 4. These findings suggest X-ray observations will, for the first time, probe a significant AGN population in the EoR, offering new insights into SMBH growth. They also provide key input for refining NewAthena's mission design and optimizing its survey strategy.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a young thick disk in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thickness of a galaxy's disk provides a valuable probe of its formation and evolution history. Observations of the Milky Way and local galaxies have revealed an ubiquitous disk structure with two distinctive components: an old thick disk and a relatively young thin disk. The formation of this dual-disk structure and the mechanisms that develop the thickness of the disk are still unclear. Whether the disk thickness inherit from the birth environment or is established through secular dynamical heating after formation is under debate. In this work we identify a relatively young ($\sim$6.6 billion years old) geometric thick disk in the Milky Way, with a scale height of $0.64$ kpc at the Solar Circle. This young thick component exhibits comparable thickness and flaring strength to the canonical old thick disk but is more radially extended and systematically younger. We also identify thin disk components that formed before and after this young thick disk. Detailed analysis of the solar vicinity structure suggests that the young thick disk marks the onset of a new phase of upside-down disk formation. These findings strongly discount the role of secular dynamical heating and support a turbulent, bursty birth environment as the primary mechanism behind thick disk formation. The existence of two thick disk components suggests that the Milky Way has undergone at least two episodes of turbulent and bursty star formation, likely triggered by galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>No detection of radio continuum from low-redshift passive spiral galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-emitting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are common in elliptical galaxies and AGN feedback is one of the possible mechanisms for regulating star formation in massive galaxies. It is unclear if all passive galaxy populations host radio AGNs and if AGN feedback is a plausible mechanism for truncating or regulating star formation in these galaxies. To determine if radio AGNs are common in passive spiral galaxies, we have measured the radio emission of 38 low-redshift passive spiral galaxies using RACS-low at 887.5 MHz and VLASS at 3 GHz. We selected a subset of 2MRS galaxies with negligible WISE 12 $\mu$m emission from warm dust, and spiral morphologies from HyperLeda, RC3, 2MRS and manual inspection. In contrast to comparable early-type galaxies, our sample has no significant radio detections, with radio flux densities below 1 mJy, implying that radio AGNs are rare or non-existent in passive spirals. Using the combined radio images and assuming radio luminosity is proportional to $K$-band luminosity, we find ${\rm log}~L_\nu \lesssim 9.01-0.4~M_K$. This falls below the radio luminosities of passive elliptical galaxies, implying radio luminosity in passive galaxies is correlated with host galaxy morphology and kinematics.</description>

Abstract: Here we use the samples of spiral and elliptical galaxies, in order to investigate theoretically some of their properties and to test the empirical relations, in the light of modified gravities. We show that the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation can be described in the light of $f(R)$ gravity, without introducing the dark matter. Also, it is possible to explain the features of fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies without the dark matter hypothesis.</description>

      <title>A preliminary cosmological analysis of stellar population synthesis of galaxies released by LAMOST LRS DR11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the universe together with the galaxies is one of the fundamental issues that we humans are most interested in. Both the observations of tidal streams from SDSS and the theory of $\Lambda$CDM support the hierarchical merging theory. The study of high redshift celestial bodies contributes to a more in-depth study of cosmology. The LAMOST low resolution search catalog DR11 v1.0 has released 11,939,296 spectra, including 11,581,542 stars, 275,302 galaxies, and 82,452 quasars, and so on. The data of 28,780 stellar population synthesis of galaxies and some high redshift quasars are used to do a preliminary statistical research. We selected the data with small errors for analysis and obtained some basic statistical conclusions. Older galaxies have relatively larger stellar velocity dispersions. The larger the metallicity, the greater the stellar velocity dispersion. These statistical results are reasonable and consistent with previous work. Because the stellar velocity dispersion is driven by the total mass of a galaxy at the first order and more massive galaxies have older ages and greater metallicities. The spectra of high redshift quasars show clear Gunn-Peterson trough and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The identified emission lines and high redshift celestial spectra released by LAMOST can be used for cosmological research.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT 1.3 GHz Observations Towards the Milky Way Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a MeerKAT survey of portions of the Milky Way bulge. The survey covers 172.8 square degrees in two contiguous mosaics above and below the Galactic Center as well as 32 single pointing fields at higher longitudes. The resolution of the images is $\sim$8\asec\ at a frequency of 1333 MHz with a typical Stokes I RMS of 20 $\mu$Jy Beam$^{-1}$. Most of the emission seen is from background extragalactic sources but many compact Galactic objects are identifiable by their polarization properties. Apparent polarized emission resulting from fine scale Faraday rotation in the ISM is widespread in this region of the Galaxy. The survey is used to search for background Giant Radio Galaxies, $&gt;$700 kpc in size, identifying 17 such objects. Data products include FITS images of Stokes I, Q, U and V as well as a Faraday analysis and lists of compact total intensity and polarized sources.</description>

      <title>Pixel-level modelling of group-scale strong lens CASSOWARY 19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11445v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first high-precision model for the group-scale strong lensing system CASSOWARY 19 (CSWA19), utilising images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Sixteen member galaxies identified via the red-sequence method, and the main halo, all modelled as the dual Pseudo Isothermal Elliptical profile (dPIE), are incorporated into a parametric lens model alongside an external shear field. To model the system, we adopt the PyAutoLens software package, employing a progressive search chain strategy for realizing the transition of source model from multiple S\'ersic profiles to a brightness-adaptive pixelization, which uses 1000 pixels in the source plane to reconstruct the background source corresponding to 177,144 image pixels in the image plane. Our results indicate that the total mass within the Einstein radius is $M_{\theta_\mathrm{E}}$ $\approx 1.41\times10^{13}$M$_{\odot}$ and the average slope of the total mass density $\rho (r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ is $\tilde{\gamma}=1.33$ within the effective radius. This slope is shallower than those measured in galaxies and groups but is closer to those of galaxy clusters. In addition, our approach successfully resolves the two merging galaxies in the background source and yields a total magnification of $\mu=103.18^{+0.23}_{-0.19}$, which is significantly higher than the outcomes from previous studies of CSWA19. In summary, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of the brightness-adaptive pixelization source reconstruction technique for modelling group-scale strong lensing systems. It can serve as a technical reference for future investigations into pixel-level modelling of the group- and cluster-scale strong lensing systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Lens Caustics with Gravitational Waves: A Uniform Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for modeling gravitational wave diffraction near fold caustics using the Uniform Approximation (UA), focusing on binary mass lenses-axially asymmetric systems with complex caustic structures. Full-wave methods based on the Kirchhoff integral become impractical in this regime due to highly oscillatory integrands. The UA provides a robust and accurate description of the wave field near folds, resolving the breakdown of Geometrical Optics at caustics and improving upon Transitional Asymptotics-based on Airy function approximations-which lack global validity. Central to our approach is the concept of the caustic width, $d_c$, a characteristic length scale defining the region where diffraction significantly alters wave propagation. We find that $d_c$ scales universally with the gravitational wavelength as ~ $ \lambda^{2/3}$ and inversely with the redshifted lens mass as ~ $ M_{Lz}^{-2/3}$. The wave amplification near the fold grows as ~ $ d_c^{-1/4}$, substantially enhancing the signal and potentially playing a key role in the detection of gravitational waves lensed near caustics. Notably, for lens masses below the galactic scale, the caustic width for gravitational waves is not negligible compared to the Einstein radius-as it is in electromagnetic lensing-making the UA essential for accurately capturing wave effects.</description>

      <title>Do We Know How to Model Reionization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I compare the power spectra of the radiation fields from two recent sets of fully-coupled simulations that model cosmic reionization: "Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) and "Thesan". While both simulations have similar power spectra of the radiation sources, the power spectra of the photoionization rate are significantly different at the same values of cosmic time or the same values of the mean neutral hydrogen fraction. However, the power spectra of the photoionization rate can be matched at large scales for the two simulations when the matching snapshots are allowed to vary independently. I.e., on large scales, the radiation field in two simulations proceeds through the same evolutionary stages, but the timing of these stages is different in different simulations and is not parameterized by an easily interpretable physical quantity like the mean neutral fraction or the mean free path. On small scales, large differences are present and remain partially unexplained.
  Both CROC and Thesan use the Variable Eddington Tensor approximation for modeling radiative transfer, but adopt different closure relations (optically thin OTVET versus M1). The role of this key difference is tested by using smaller simulations with a new cosmological simulation code that implements both closure relations in a controlled environment (the same hydro, cooling, and gravity solvers and the star formation recipe). In these controlled tests, both the M1 closure and the OTVET ansatz follow the expected behavior from a simple analytical approximation, demonstrating that the differences in the 2-point function of the radiation field induced by the choice of the Eddington tensor are not dominant.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment of ICM within the A3266 cluster I: radial profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the elemental abundances distribution of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the A3266 cluster using {\it XMM-Newton} observations. This analysis uses EPIC-pn data, including a new energy scale calibration, which allows us to measure velocities with uncertainties down to $\Delta v \sim 80$ km/s, and MOS observations. We measured radial O, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe profiles. This is the first study of elemental abundances beyond Fe using X-ray observations within the A3266 cluster. The abundance profiles display discontinuities similar to those obtained for the temperature. We modeled the X/Fe ratio profiles with a linear combination of type~Ia supernovae (SNIa) and core-collapse supernovae (SNcc) models. We found that the SNIa ratio over the total cluster enrichment tends to be uniform, with a $42\pm 5\%$ contribution. Such a trend supports an early ICM enrichment scenario, with most metals produced before clustering.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Eddington and Malmquist Biases in Latent-Inclination Regression of the Tully-Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise estimation of the Tully-Fisher relation is compromised by statistical biases and uncertain inclination corrections. To account for selection effects (Malmquist bias) while avoiding individual inclination corrections, I introduce a Bayesian method based on likelihood functions that incorporate Sine-distributed scatter of rotation velocities, Gaussian scatter from intrinsic dispersion and measurement error, and the observational selection function. However, tests of unidirectional models on simulated datasets reveal an additional bias arising from neglect of the Gaussian scatter in the independent variable. This additional bias is identified as a generalized Eddington bias, which distorts the data distribution independently of Malmuqist bias. I introduce two extensions to the Bayesian method that successfully mitigate the Eddington bias: (1) analytical bias corrections of the dependent variable prior to likelihood computation, and (2) a bidirectional dual-scatter model that includes the Gaussian scatter of the independent variable in the likelihood function. By rigorously accounting for Malmquist and Eddington biases in a latent-inclination regression analysis, this work establishes a framework for unbiased distance estimates from standardizable candles, critical for improving determinations of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Radiative-transfer models for dusty Type II supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust is expected to form on a year timescale in core-collapse supernova (SN) ejecta. Its existence is revealed through an infrared brightening, an optical dimming, or a blue-red emission-line profile asymmetry. To investigate how the dust location and amount impact observations, we computed ultraviolet-to-optical spectra of interacting and standard, noninteracting Type II SNe using state-of-the-art models -- for simplicity we adopted 0.1micron silicate grains. These models account for the full ejecta and treat both radioactive decay and shock power that arises from interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material. In a Type IIn SN such as 1998S at one year, approximately 3e-4Msun of dust within the dense shell reproduces the broad, asymmetric Halpha profile. It causes an optical dimming of ~2mag (which obscures any emission from the inner, metal-rich ejecta) but, paradoxically, a more modest dimming of the ultraviolet, which originates from the outer parts of the dense shell. In Type II SNe with late-time interaction, such as SN2017eaw, dust in the low-mass, fast outer ejecta dense shell tends to be optically thin, impacting little the optical spectrum for dust masses of order 1e-4Msun. In such SNe II with interaction, dust in the inner metal-rich ejecta has negligible effect on observed spectra in the ultraviolet and optical. In noninteracting SNe II, dust within the metal-rich ejecta preferentially quenches the [OI]6300,6364 and [CaII]7291,7323 metal lines, biasing the emission in favor of the H-rich material which generates the Halpha and FeII emission below 5500A. Our model with 5e-4Msun of dust below 2000km/s matches closely the optical spectrum of SN1987A at 714d. Modeling historical SNe requires treating both the ejecta material and the dust, as well as multiple power sources, although interaction power will generally dominate.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Measurement of Supermassive Black Hole Masses: QPE Timing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are intense repeating soft X-ray bursts with recurrence times about a few hours to a few weeks from galactic nuclei. More and more analyses show that (at least a fraction of) QPEs are the result of collisions between a stellar mass object (SMO, a stellar mass black hole or a main sequence star) and an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in galactic nuclei. Previous studies have shown that the SMO trajectory can be reconstructed from QPE timing data, consequently the SMBH mass can be robustly measured from tracing a single SMO. In this Letter, we construct a comprehensive Bayesian framework for implementing the QPE timing method, explore the optimal QPE observation strategy for measuring SMBH masses, and forecast the measurement precision expected in the era of multi-target X-ray telescope, Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH). As a result, we find the QPE timing method is of great potential in precise measurement of SMBH masses (and spins), especially in the lower mass end ($\lesssim 10^7 M_\odot$) where QPEs prevail and relevant dynamical timescales are reasonably short to be measured.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally Induced Explosive Outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the reporting of extensive and luminous star-forming regions associated with explosive outflows. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding of the possible physical mechanisms that produce such energetic and isotropic events. Then, we propose a gravitational interaction as a likely mechanism that could trigger explosive outflows in dense star-forming regions. This could constrain the physical conditions that generate an explosive outflow produced by the close dynamical encounter of a runaway star with a clump cluster in dynamical equilibrium. Then, we have produced a set of $N$-body simulations that account for the collision of a 10M$_\odot$ stellar object with a cluster of particles with a mass that ranges from 0 to 50 \msun. We propose a parameter to describe the interaction, the evaporation parameter, that represents the fraction of stars that become unbound. The main result is that, when the cluster mass is less than, or up to a few times the stellar mass, the collision will produce an explosive outflow, ejecting a significant fraction of the cluster members with velocities larger than the impact velocity. All of our models produce an explosive outflow, with different characteristics, which increases the probability that a close encounter could be responsible for producing the observed flows.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Anatomy of a water-rich, inclined, brown dwarf disk: lack of abundant hydrocarbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined ($i\!\sim\!70^\circ$) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \,\,\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.</description>

Abstract: The Milky Way halo is one of the few galactic haloes that provides a unique insight into galaxy formation by resolved stellar populations. Here, we present a catalogue of $\sim$47 million halo stars selected independent of parallax and line-of-sight velocities, using a combination of Gaia DR3 proper motion and photometry by means of their reduced proper motion. We select high tangential velocity (halo) main sequence stars and fit distances to them using their simple colour-absolute-magnitude relation. This sample reaches out to $\sim$21 kpc with a median distance of $6.6$ kpc thereby probing much further out than would be possible using reliable Gaia parallaxes. The typical uncertainty in their distances is $0.57_{-0.26}^{+0.56}$ kpc. Using the colour range $0.45&lt;(G_0-G_\mathrm{RP,0})&lt;0.715$ where the main sequence is narrower, gives an even better accuracy down to $0.39_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$ kpc in distance. The median velocity uncertainty for stars within this colour range is 15.5 km/s. The distribution of these sources in the sky, together with their tangential component velocities, are very well-suited to study retrograde substructures. We explore the selection of two complex retrograde streams: GD-1 and Jhelum. For these streams, we resolve the gaps, wiggles and density breaks reported in the literature more clearly. We also illustrate the effect of the kinematic selection bias towards high proper motion stars and incompleteness at larger distances due to Gaia's scanning law. These examples showcase how the full RPM catalogue made available here can help us paint a more detailed picture of the build-up of the Milky Way halo.</description>

      <title>Gaia's brightest very metal-poor (VMP) stars. Metallicity catalogue of a thousand VMP stars from Gaia's radial velocity spectrometer spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Gaia DR3 has offered the scientific community a remarkable dataset of approximately one million spectra acquired with the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) in the Calcium II triplet region, that is well-suited to identify very metal-poor (VMP) stars. However, over 40% of these spectra have no released parameters by Gaia's GSP Spec pipeline in the domain of VMP stars, whereas VMP stars are key tracers of early Galactic evolution. Aims. We aim to provide spectroscopic metallicities for VMP stars using Gaia RVS spectra, thereby producing a catalogue of bright VMP stars distributed over the full sky that can serve as the basis to study early chemical evolution throughout the Galaxy. Methods. We select VMP stars using photometric metallicities from the literature and analyse the Gaia RVS spectra to infer spectroscopic metallicities for these stars. Results. The inferred metallicities agree very well with literature high-resolution metallicities with a median systematic offset of 0.1 dex and standard deviation of $\sim$0.15 dex. The purity of this sample in the VMP regime is $\sim$80% with outliers representing a mere $\sim$3%. Conclusions. We make available an all-sky catalogue of $\sim$1500 stars with reliable spectroscopic metallicities down to [Fe/H]$\sim$-4.0, of which $\sim$1000 are VMP stars. More than 75% of these stars have either no metallicity value in the literature to date or are flagged to be unreliable in their literature metallicity estimates. This catalogue of bright (G&lt;13) VMP stars is three times larger than the current sample of well-studied VMP stars in the literature in this magnitude range, making it ideal for high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up and to study the properties of VMP stars in different parts of our Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pristine-\textit{Gaia} synthetic catalogue provides reliable photometric metallicities for $\sim$30 million FGK stars using the Pristine survey model and Gaia XP spectra. We perform the first low-to-medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up of bright (G&lt;15) and distant (up to 35 kpc) very and extremely metal-poor (V/EMP, [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5) red giant branch stars from this. We use Isaac Newton Telescope/Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (INT/IDS) observations centred around the calcium triplet region ideal for V/EMP stars. We find that 76\% of our stars indeed have [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5 with these inferred spectroscopic metallicities and only 3\% are outliers with [Fe/H] &gt; -2.0. We report a success rate of 77\% and 38\% in finding stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-2.5 and -3.0 respectively. This will allow for 10,000-20,000 homogeneously analysed EMP stars using the WEAVE survey follow-up of Pristine EMP candidates. We associate 20\%, 46\%, and 34\% of the stars to be confined to the disc plane, or to have inner and outer halo orbits, respectively. We also associate these V/EMP stars to known accretion events such as Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), LMS-1/Wukong, Thamnos, Helmi streams, Sagittarius, Sequoia, etc. For the stars that orbit close to the disc plane, we find that the prograde region with low vertical action is overdense with a significance of 4$\sigma$ as compared to its retrograde counterpart. We also find three new (brightest) members of the most metal-poor stellar stream, C-19, one of which is 50$^\circ$ away from the main body of the stream. Our measured mean metallicity, velocity dispersion, and stream width are consistent with the literature, but our results favour a higher distance ($\sim$21.5 kpc) for the stream. We publish a catalogue (and 1D spectra) of 215 V/EMP stars from this spectroscopic follow-up and showcase the power of chemokinematic analysis of V/EMP end.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Polarized Dust Emission Using Data from the First Flight of SPIDER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using data from the first flight of SPIDER and from Planck HFI, we probe the properties of polarized emission from interstellar dust in the SPIDER observing region. Component separation algorithms operating in both the spatial and harmonic domains are applied to probe their consistency and to quantify modeling errors associated with their assumptions. Analyses of diffuse Galactic dust emission spanning the full SPIDER region demonstrate i) a spectral energy distribution that is broadly consistent with a modified-blackbody (MBB) model with a spectral index of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.45\pm0.05$ $(1.47\pm0.06)$ for $E$ ($B$)-mode polarization, slightly lower than that reported by Planck for the full sky; ii) an angular power spectrum broadly consistent with a power law; and iii) no significant detection of line-of-sight polarization decorrelation. Tests of several modeling uncertainties find only a modest impact (~10% in $\sigma_r$) on SPIDER's sensitivity to the cosmological tensor-to-scalar ratio. The size of the SPIDER region further allows for a statistically meaningful analysis of the variation in foreground properties within it. Assuming a fixed dust temperature $T_\mathrm{d}=19.6$ K, an analysis of two independent sub-regions of that field results in inferred values of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.52\pm0.06$ and $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.09\pm0.09$, which are inconsistent at the $3.9\,\sigma$ level. Furthermore, a joint analysis of SPIDER and Planck 217 and 353 GHz data within one sub-region is inconsistent with a simple MBB at more than $3\,\sigma$, assuming a common morphology of polarized dust emission over the full range of frequencies. This evidence of variation may inform the component-separation approaches of future CMB polarization experiments.</description>

      <title>JWST PRIMER: A lack of outshining in four normal z =4-6 galaxies from the ALMA-CRISTAL Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spatially resolved analysis of four star-forming galaxies at $z = 4.44-5.64$ using data from the JWST PRIMER and ALMA-CRISTAL surveys to probe the stellar and inter-stellar medium properties on the sub-kpc scale. In the $1-5\,\mu{\rm m}$ JWST NIRCam imaging we find that the galaxies are composed of multiple clumps (between $2$ and $\sim 8$) separated by $\simeq 5\,{\rm kpc}$, with comparable morphologies and sizes in the rest-frame UV and optical. Using BAGPIPES to perform pixel-by-pixel SED fitting to the JWST data we show that the SFR ($\simeq 25\,{\rm M}_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$) and stellar mass (${\rm log}_{10}(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) \simeq 9.5$) derived from the resolved analysis are in close ($ \lesssim 0.3\,{\rm dex}$) agreement with those obtained by fitting the integrated photometry. In contrast to studies of lower-mass sources, we thus find a reduced impact of outshining of the older (more massive) stellar populations in these normal $z \simeq 5$ galaxies. Our JWST analysis recovers bluer rest-frame UV slopes ($\beta \simeq -2.1$) and younger ages ($\simeq 100\,{\rm Myr}$) than archival values. We find that the dust continuum from ALMA-CRISTAL seen in two of these galaxies correlates, as expected, with regions of redder rest-frame UV slopes and the SED-derived $A_{\rm V}$, as well as the peak in the stellar mass map. We compute the resolved IRX-$\beta$ relation, showing that the IRX is consistent with the local starburst attenuation curve and further demonstrating the presence of an inhomogeneous dust distribution within the galaxies. A comparison of the CRISTAL sources to those from the FirstLight zoom-in simulation of galaxies with the same $M_{\star}$ and SFR reveals similar age and colour gradients, suggesting that major mergers may be important in the formation of clumpy galaxies at this epoch.</description>

      <title>Semi-confined supernova feedback in HII region bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic-scale simulations rely on sub-grid models to provide prescriptions for the coupling between supernova (SN) feedback and the interstellar medium (ISM). Many of these models are computed in 1-D to allow for an efficient way to account for the variability of properties of their local environment. However, small-scale simulations revealed that the release of energy from SNe within molecular clouds can be highly asymmetrical. This is largely due to the presence of pre-SN feedback, such as ionizing radiation, that are able to carve cavities and channels around the progenitors prior to their detonation. Being partially confined, the SN energy escapes into the outer ISM preferentially through these channels, departing from the spherically symmetric 1-D descriptions. To understand by how much the feedback output could differ, we present a theoretical model for a semi-confined SN. The problem concerns a SN expanding into an evolved HII region, bounded by a molecular cloud with pre-existing vents. With the aid of simple 3-D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this mode of energy release increases the local dynamical impact of the outflows, and extends the timescales over which the SN is energetically coupled to the surrounding matter. We also show that the amount of small-scale solenoidal turbulence driven by semi-confined SNe may be amplified.</description>

      <title>No evidence (yet) for increased star-formation efficiency at early times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early JWST observations have revealed substantial numbers of galaxies out to redshifts as high as $z \simeq 14$, reflecting a slow evolution of the galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) not anticipated by many models of galaxy evolution. The discovery of fairly massive galaxies at early times has again been viewed as a challenge to our understanding of early galaxy growth or even ${\rm \Lambda}$CDM cosmology. Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model which shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably as expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation efficiency consistent with that observed today. Crucially, this model matches the observed galaxy UV LF at $z \simeq 6-13$ and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at $z \simeq 6-8$. Using new constraints on Lyman continuum escape and the ionizing photon production efficiency, we also predict the progress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observations. The requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy between mass-to-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, where the typical mass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond $z \simeq 6$. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF, cosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be reproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with a formation epoch at $z \simeq 15$. A key prediction of our model therefore is that there should be a more rapid drop-off in the galaxy number density beyond $z \simeq 15$, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset the precipitous descent of the halo mass function.</description>

      <title>Dark matter spiral arms in Milky Way-like halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between the dark matter (DM) halo and the stellar disc is a key factor in galactic evolution. While the interaction between structures like the Galactic bar and DM halos has been explored (e.g. slowing down of the bar due to dynamical friction), the effect of spiral arms on the DM halo distribution has received limited attention. We analyze a suite of simulations featuring strong stellar spiral arms, ranging in complexity from test-particle models to fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Using Fourier transforms, we characterize the phase and amplitude of the stellar spirals at different times and radii. We then apply the same methodology to DM particles near the stellar disc and compare trends in Fourier coefficients and phases between the two components. We detect a clear spiral arm signal in the DM distribution, correlated with the stellar spirals, confirming the reaction of the halo. The strength of the DM spirals consistently measures around 10\% of that of the stellar spiral arms. In the $N$-body simulation, the DM spiral persistently trails the stellar spiral arm by approximately $10^\circ$. A strong spiral signal of a few km\,s$^{-1}$ appears in the radial, azimuthal, and vertical velocities of halo particles, distinct from the stellar kinematic signature. In a test-particle simulation with an analytical spiral potential (omitting self-gravity), we reproduce a similar density and kinematic response, showing that the test-particle halo responds in the same way as the $N$-body halo. Finally, we also find the rest of the simulations, indicating that the dynamical signatures of the forced response in the DM halo are independent of the dynamical origin of the stellar spiral arms. We reveal the ubiquitous presence of DM spiral arms in Milky Way-like galaxies, driven by a forced response to the stellar spiral potential. (ABR)</description>

Abstract: We report the light-curve analysis for the event MOA-2020-BLG-135, which leads to the discovery of a new Neptune-class planet, MOA-2020-BLG-135Lb. With a derived mass ratio of $q=1.52_{-0.31}^{+0.39} \times 10^{-4}$ and separation $s\approx1$, the planet lies exactly at the break and likely peak of the exoplanet mass-ratio function derived by the MOA collaboration (Suzuki et al. 2016). We estimate the properties of the lens system based on a Galactic model and considering two different Bayesian priors: one assuming that all stars have an equal planet-hosting probability and the other that planets are more likely to orbit more massive stars. With a uniform host mass prior, we predict that the lens system is likely to be a planet of mass $m_\mathrm{planet}=11.3_{-6.9}^{+19.2} M_\oplus$ and a host star of mass $M_\mathrm{host}=0.23_{-0.14}^{+0.39} M_\odot$, located at a distance $D_L=7.9_{-1.0}^{+1.0}\;\mathrm{kpc}$. With a prior that holds that planet occurrence scales in proportion to the host star mass, the estimated lens system properties are $m_\mathrm{planet}=25_{-15}^{+22} M_\oplus$, $M_\mathrm{host}=0.53_{-0.32}^{+0.42} M_\odot$, and $D_L=8.3_{-1.0}^{+0.9}\; \mathrm{kpc}$. This planet qualifies for inclusion in the extended MOA-II exoplanet microlens sample.</description>

      <title>Quasars can Signpost Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found in the centers of massive galaxies, and galaxy mergers should eventually lead to SMBH mergers. Quasar activity has long been associated with galaxy mergers, so here we investigate if supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are preferentially found in quasars. Our multimessenger investigation folds together a gravitational wave background signal from NANOGrav, a sample of periodic AGN candidates from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and a quasar mass function, to estimate an upper limit on the fraction of quasars which could host a SMBHB. We find at 95\% confidence that quasars are at most five times as likely to host a SMBHB as a random galaxy. Pulsar timing arrays may therefore be more likely to find SMBHBs by prioritizing quasars over a random selection of galaxies in their searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SynthPop, a new open source, modular population synthesis Galactic modeling software to simulate catalogs of Milky Way stars along any sightline outward from the Sun. Motivated by a lack flexibility in existing Galactic models, SynthPop is coded entirely in python, can be run standalone or as an imported module, and is configured by json files that allow different model components to be switched out as desired. We describe the modular code structure, how the population generation process runs, and how to use the code. We also present model validation testing and known inaccuracies, and present an example of the code use, comparing Gaia data and the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot to a SynthPop implementation. The code is available now via GitHub with ReadTheDocs documentation and can be installed via pip.</description>

      <title>ExoMolHR: A Relational Database of Empirical High-Resolution Molecular Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ExoMolHR is an empirical, high-resolution molecular spectrum calculator for the high-temperature molecular line lists available from the ExoMol molecular database. Uncertainties, where available, in recommended ExoMol datasets are used to select highly accurate spectral lines. These lines largely rely on empirical energy levels generated through the MARVEL (measured active rotation vibration energy levels) procedure, which is being systematically used to improve the energy and transition data provided by the ExoMol database. The freely accessible ExoMolHR database provides line positions with calculated intensities for a user-specified wavenumber/wavelength range and temperature. Spectra can be plotted on the ExoMolHR website (https://www.exomol.com/exomolhr/) or downloaded as a CSV file. Cross sections can be calculated using the Python program PyExoCross. The ExoMolHR database currently provides 24307135 spectral lines for 33 molecules and 58 isotopologues; these numbers will increase as the ExoMol database is updated.</description>
