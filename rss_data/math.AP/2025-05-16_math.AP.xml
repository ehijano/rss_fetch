      <title>Convergence of approximate solutions constructed by the finite volume method for the moisture transport model in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a nonlinear parabolic equation in the one dimensional interval. The equation was proposed as a mathematical model for moisture transport in porous media. Its features are that the diffusion coefficient depends on the unknown function and the boundary condition is not monotone. Namely, our equation is regarded as the pseudo monotone type. The aim of this paper is to prove the convergence of approximate solutions constructed by the finite volume method. Also, we establish the uniqueness of solutions by the dual equation method.</description>

      <title>Monotone solutions to mean field games master equation in the $L^2$-monotone setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with extending the notion of monotone solution to the mean field game (MFG) master equation to situations in which the coefficients are displacement monotone, instead of the previously introduced notion in the flat monotone regime. To account for this new setting, we work directly on the equation satisfied by the controls of the MFG. Following previous works, we define an appropriate notion of solution under which uniqueness and stability results hold for solutions without any differentiability assumption with respect to probability measures. Thanks to those properties, we show the existence of a monotone solution to displacement monotone mean field games under local regularity assumptions on the coefficients and sufficiently strong monotonicity. Albeit they are not the focus of this article, results presented are also of interest for mean field games of control and general mean field forward backward systems. In order to account for this last setting, we use the notion of $L^2$-monotonicity instead of displacement monotonicity, those two notions being equivalent in the particular case of MFG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present a result established in [BGR24] where we prove that nonlinear Schrodinger equations on the circle, without external parameters, admit plenty of infinite dimensional non resonant invariant tori, or equivalently, plenty of almost periodic solutions. Our aim is to propose an extended sketch of the proof, emphasizing the new points which have enabled us to achieve this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide few remarks on nonlinear Landau damping that concerns decay of the electric field in the classical Vlasov-Poisson system near spatially homogenous equilibria. In particular, this includes the analyticity framework, \`a la Grenier-Nguyen-Rodnianski, for non specialists, treating the analytic case studied by Mouhot-Villani, among other remarks for plasmas confined on a torus and in the whole space.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal oscillations for eigenfunctions in rod like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spectrum of the Laplace operator on 3D rod structures, with a small cross section depending on a small parameter $\varepsilon$. The boundary conditions are of Dirichlet type on the basis of this structure and Neumann on the lateral boundary. We focus on the low frequencies. We study the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions, which are approached as $\varepsilon\to 0$ by those of a 1D model with Dirichlet boundary conditions, but which takes into account the geometry of the domain. Explicit and numerical computations enlighten the interest of this study, when the parameter becomes smaller. At the same time they show that in order to capture oscillations in the transverse direction we need to deal with the high frequencies. For prism like domains, we show the different asymptotic behavior of the spectrum depending on the boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang model: well-posedness and singular limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a nonlocal version of the Generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang model, a second-order vehicular traffic model where the empty road velocity is a Lagrangian marker governed by a transport equation. The evolution of the car density is described by a continuity equation where the drivers' velocity depends on both the empty road velocity and the convolution of the car density with an anisotropic kernel. We establish existence and uniqueness results. When the convolution kernel is replaced by a Dirac Delta, the nonlocal model formally boils down to the classical (local) Generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang model, which consists of a conservation law coupled with a transport equation. In the case of exponential kernels, we establish convergence in the nonlocal-to-local limit by proving an Oleinik-type estimate for the convolution term. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonlocal-to-local limit result for a system of two non-decoupling equations with a nonlocal flux function.</description>

      <title>Korevaar-Schoen and heat kernel characterizations of Sobolev and BV spaces on local trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Sobolev and BV spaces on local trees which are metric spaces locally isometric to real trees. Such spaces are equipped with a Radon measure satisfying a locally uniform volume growth condition. Using the intrinsic geodesic structure, we define weak gradients and develop from it a coherent theory of Sobolev and BV spaces. We provide two main characterizations: one via Korevaar-Schoen-type energy functionals and another via the heat kernel associated with the natural Dirichlet form. Applications include interpolation results for Besov-Lipschitz spaces, critical exponents computations, and a Nash inequality. In globally tree-like settings we also establish $L^p$ gradient bounds for the heat semigroup.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problem for Multi-Dimensional Piston Models with Large Velocity Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a circular symmetric piston suddenly expands into a still gas, a leading shock wave is generated. This paper investigates an inverse problem of reconstructing the trajectory of the piston from the given leading shock front and the given initial flow conditions. We observe that in piston models, as the initial density goes to zero, the piston approaches the shock front; however, in the region between the piston and the shock front, the strict hyperbolicity of the system degenerates. By applying asymptotic analysis, we provide quantitative characterizations of the distance between the piston and the shock front, and the degeneration of strict hyperbolicity. Consequently, by designing appropriate a priori assumptions to balance the benefits and drawbacks arising as the initial density approaches zero, we employ the method of characteristics to prove the global-in-time existence of the piecewise smooth solution for this inverse problem. In particular, the resulting flow structure exhibits significant velocity variations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the explicit convex relaxation of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations. We provide a non-trivial lower estimate on the lamination hull and an upper estimate on the $\Lambda$-convex hull, the latter providing inequalities which will be satisfied by weak limits of weak solution of the ideal MHD equations, which serve as a model of averaged turbulent magnetohydrodynamical flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a Pogorelov type interior $C^2$ estimate for the Hessian quotient equation $\frac{\sigma _n}{\sigma _k}\left( D^2u\right) =f$. As an application, we show that convex viscosity solutions are regular for $k\leq n-3$ if $u\in C^{1,\alpha}$ with $\alpha&gt;1-\frac{2}{n-k}$ or $u\in W^{2,p}$ with $p\geq\frac{(n-1)(n-k)}{2}$. Both exponents are sharp in view of the example in arXiv:2401.12229.</description>

      <title>A ill-posed scattering problem saturating Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the well-posedness (or lack thereof) of three-dimensional time-harmonic wave propagation problems modeled by the Helmholtz equation. It is well-known that if the problem is set in bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions, then the Helmholtz problem is well-posed for all (real-valued) frequencies except for a sequence of countably many resonant frequencies that accumulate at infinity. In fact, if the domain is sufficiently smooth, this can be quantified further and Weyl's law states that the number of resonant frequencies less than a given $\omega &gt; 0$ scales as $\omega^3$. On the other hand, scattering problems set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a radiation condition at infinity and a bounded obstacle modeled by variations in the PDE coefficients are well-posed for all frequencies under mild regularity assumption on such coefficients. In 2001, Filinov provided a counter example of a rough coefficient such that the scattering problem is not well-posed for (at least) a single frequency $\omega$. In this contribution, we use this result to show that for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ we can design a rough coefficient corresponding to a compactly supported obstacle such that the scattering problem is ill-posed for a countable sequence of frequencies accumulating at infinity, and such that the number of such frequencies less than any given $\omega &gt; 0$ scales as $\omega^{3-\varepsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Infinite multiplicity of positive solutions of an inhomogeneous supercritical elliptic equation on $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with positive radial solutions of the inhomogeneous elliptic equation $\Delta u+K(|x|)u^p+\mu f(|x|)=0$ on $\mathbb{R}^N$, where $N\ge 3$, $\mu&gt;0$ and $K$ and $f$ are nonnegative nontrivial functions. If $K(r)\sim r^{\alpha}$, $\alpha&gt;-2$, near $r=0$, $K(r)\sim r^{\beta}$, $\beta&gt;-2$, near $r=\infty$ and certain assumptions on $f$ are imposed, then the problem has a unique positive radial singular solution for a certain range of $\mu$. We show that existence of a positive radial singular solution is equivalent to existence of infinitely many positive bounded solutions which are not uniformly bounded, if $p$ is between the critical Sobolev exponent $p_S(\alpha)$ and Joseph-Lundgren exponent $p_{JL}(\alpha)$. Using these theorems, we establish existence of infinitely many positive bounded solutions which are not uniformly bounded, for $p_S(\alpha)&lt;p&lt;p_{JL}(\alpha)$ if $K(r)=r^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha&gt;-2$.</description>

      <title>Contact in fluid-plate interaction: formation and detachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an interaction problem between an elastic plate and a compressible viscous fluid located between the rigid bottom $z=0$ and the plate. First, by utilizing the vertical fluid dissipation, we show that $\ln\eta(t) \in L^1$ for any $t&gt;0$ provided that $\ln\eta_0\in L^1$, ensuring that additional plate contact can form only on a set of a measure zero. Then, by utilizing the expanding capability of compressible fluid pressure, we show that all contact has to detach in finite time provided that the source force acting onto the plate is not pushing down excessively. Finally, we show that contact at any point can be detached in any given time with a strong enough source force localized around that point which is pulling the plate up. This is the first result where detachment of contact is proven in fluid-structure interaction.</description>

      <title>Monotone three-dimensional surface and equivalent formulations of the generalized bathtub model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model for single-lane traffic, vehicle trajectories follow the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle and can be represented by a monotone three-dimensional surface of cumulative vehicle count. In contrast, the generalized bathtub model, which describes congestion dynamics in transportation networks using relative space, typically violates the FIFO principle, making its representation more challenging.
  Building on the characteristic distance ordering concept, we observe that trips in the generalized bathtub model can be ordered by their characteristic distances (remaining trip distance plus network travel distance). We define a new cumulative number of trips ahead of a trip with a given remaining distance at a time instant, showing it forms a monotone three-dimensional surface despite FIFO violations. Using the inverse function theorem, we derive equivalent formulations with different coordinates and dependent variables, including special cases for Vickrey's bathtub model and the basic bathtub model.
  We demonstrate numerical methods based on these formulations and discuss trip-based approaches for discrete demand patterns. This study enhances understanding of the generalized bathtub model's properties, facilitating its application in network traffic flow modeling, congestion pricing, and transportation planning.</description>

      <title>The Filippov characteristic flow for the aggregation equation with mildly singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2811</link>
      <description>arXiv:1409.2811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existence and uniqueness of global in time measure solution for the multidimensional aggregation equation is analyzed. Such a system can be written as a continuity equation with a velocity field computed through a self-consistent interaction potential. In Carrillo et al. (Duke Math J (2011)), a well-posedness theory based on the geometric approach of gradient flows in measure metric spaces has been developed for mildly singular potentials at the origin under the basic assumption of being lambda-convex. We propose here an alternative method using classical tools from PDEs. We show the existence of a characteristic flow based on Filippov's theory of discontinuous dynamical systems such that the weak measure solution is the pushforward measure with this flow. Uniqueness is obtained thanks to a contraction argument in transport distances using the lambda-convexity of the potential. Moreover, we show the equivalence of this solution with the gradient flow solution. Finally, we show the convergence of a numerical scheme for general measure solutions in this framework allowing for the simulation of solutions for initial smooth densities after their first blow-up time in Lp-norms.</description>

      <title>On non-uniqueness of solitary waves on two-dimensional rotational flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solitary water waves on a rotational, unidirectional flow in a two-dimensional channel of finite depth. Ovsyannikov has conjectured in 1983 that the solitary wave is uniquely determined by the Bernoulli constant, mass flux and by the flow force. This conjecture was disproved by Plotnikov in 1992 for the ir-rotational flow. In this paper we show that this conjecture is wrong also for rotational flows. Moreover we prove that in any neighborhood of the first bifurcation point on the branch of solitary waves, approaching the extreme wave, there are infinitely many pairs of solitary waves corresponding to the same Bernoulli constant. We give a description of the structure of this set of pairs. The proof is based on a bifurcation analysis of the global branch of solitary waves which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu -type characterization for Sobolev differential forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, a result by Bourgain, Brezis, and Mironescu characterizes when a function $f \in L^p(\Omega)$ is in the Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ based on the limiting behavior of its Besov seminorms. We prove a direct analogue of this result which characterizes when a differential $k$-form $\omega \in L^p(\wedge^k T^* \Omega)$ has a weak exterior derivative $d\omega \in L^p(\wedge^{k+1} T^* \Omega)$, where the analogue of the Besov seminorm that our result uses is based on integration over simplices.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of area minimizing currents at boundaries with arbitrary multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an area minimizing integral $m$-current $T$ within a submanifold $\Sigma$ of $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$, taking a boundary $\Gamma$ with arbitrary multiplicity $Q \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, where $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ are $C^{3, \kappa}$. We prove a sharp generalization of Allard's boundary regularity theorem to a higher multiplicity setting. Precisely, we prove that the set of density $Q/2$ singular boundary points of $T$ is $\mathcal{H}^{m-3}$-rectifiable. As a consequence, we show that the entire boundary regular set, without any assumptions on the density, is open and dense in $\Gamma$ which is also dimensionally sharp. Moreover, we prove that if $p \in \Gamma$ admits an open neighborhood in $\Gamma$ consisting of density $Q/2$ points with a tangent cone supported in a half $m$-plane, then $p$ is regular.
  Furthermore, we show that if the convex barrier condition is satisfied-namely, if $\Gamma$ is a closed manifold that lies at the boundary of a uniformly convex set and $\Sigma = \mathbb{R}^{m+n}$-then the entire boundary singular set is $\mathcal{H}^{m-3}$-rectifiable. Additionally, we investigate certain assumptions on $\Gamma$ that enable us to provide further information about the singular boundary set.</description>

      <title>Analysis of an Inelastic Contact Problem for the Damped Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the dynamic behavior of a viscoelastic string oscillating above a rigid obstacle in a one-dimensional setting, accounting for inelastic contact between the string and the obstacle. We construct a global-in-time weak solution to this problem by using an approximation method that incorporates a penalizing repulsive force of the form $\frac1\varepsilon\chi_{\{\eta&lt;0\}} (\partial_t\eta)^-$. The weak solution exhibits well-controlled energy dissipation, occurring only during contact on a set of zero measure and exclusively when the string moves downward. Furthermore, the velocity is shown to vanish after contact in a specific weak sense. This model serves as a simplified framework for studying contact problems in fluid-structure interaction contexts.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Micromagnetics: Compactness Criteria, Existence of Minimizers, and Brown's Fundamental Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence and qualitative properties of minimizers for a class of nonlocal micromagnetic energy functionals defined on bounded domains. The considered energy functional consists of a symmetric exchange interaction, which penalizes spatial variations in magnetization, and a magnetostatic self-energy term that accounts for long-range dipolar interactions. Motivated by the extension of Brown's fundamental theorem on fine ferromagnetic particles to nonlocal settings, we develop a rigorous variational framework in $L^2(\Omega;\mathbb{S}^2)$ under mild assumptions on the interaction kernel $j$, including symmetry, L\'evy-type integrability, and prescribed singular behavior. For spherical domains, we generalize Browns fundamental results by identifying critical radii $R^*$ and $R^{**}$ that delineate distinct energetic regimes: for $ R \leq R^*$, the uniform magnetization state is energetically preferable (small-body regime), whereas for $R \geq R^{**}$, non-uniform magnetization configurations become dominant (large-body regime). These transitions are analyzed through Poincar\'e-type inequalities and explicit energy comparisons between uniform and vortex-like magnetization states.
  Our results directly connect classical micromagnetic theory and contemporary nonlocal models, providing new insights into domain structure formation in nanoscale magnetism. Furthermore, the mathematical framework developed in this work contributes to advancing theoretical foundations for applications in spintronics and data storage technologies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the $L^{p_1}(G) \times L^{p_2}(G)$ to $L^{p}(G)$ boundedness of the bilinear Bochner-Riesz means associated with the sub-Laplacian on M\'etivier group $G$ under the H\"older's relation $1/p = 1/p_1 + 1/p_2$, $1\leq p_1, p_2 \leq \infty$. Our objective is to obtain boundedness results, analogous to the Euclidean setting, where the Euclidean dimension in the smoothness threshold is possibly replaced by the topological dimension of the underlying M\'etivier group $G$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness and uniqueness of the Cauchy problem for a class of porous media equations defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and demonstrate the $L^1-L^p$ smoothing effect. In particular, we establish that the logarithm of the ratio of the $L^p$ norm to the $L^1$ norm decreases super-exponentially fast during the initial phase, subsequently decaying to zero exponentially fast in the latter phase. This implies that if the initial data is solely in $L^1$, then for $t&gt;0$, the solution will belong to $L^p$ for any $p\in [1,\infty)$. The results are obtained under the assumption of a Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

Let $(u, B)$ be a smooth double Beltrami solution to the stationary Hall-MHD equations in $\Bbb R^3$, satisfying $\int_{\Bbb R^3} (|u|^q + |B|^q )dx &lt;+\infty$ for some $q\in [2, 3)$, then $u=B=0$. In the case of $B=0$ the theorem reduces the previously known Liouville type result for the Beltrami solutions to the Euler equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new definition of stable $(r+1)$-th capillary hypersurfaces from variational perspective for any $1\leq r\leq n-1$. More precisely, we define stable $(r+1)$-th capillary hypersurfaces to be smooth local minimizers of a new energy functional under volume-preserving and contact angle-preserving variations. Using the new concept of the stable $(r+1)$-th capillary hypersurfaces, we generalize the stability results of Souam \cite{Souam} in a Euclidean half-space and Guo-Wang-Xia \cite{GWX} in a horoball in hyperbolic space for capillary hypersurface to $(r+1)$-th capillary hypersurface case.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness in a Hartree-Fock model for graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a monolayer graphitic film in which electrons behave like two-dimensional Dirac fermions without mass. Its study has attracted a wide interest in the domain of condensed matter physics. In particular, it represents an ideal system to test the comprehension of 2D massless relativistic particles in a laboratory, the Fermi velocity being 300 times smaller than the speed of light. In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree- Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external time-dependent electric potentials, such as those induced by local charge defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms. Our approach is based on a well established non-perturbative framework originating from the study of three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Stein-Weiss, and power weight Korn type Hardy-Sobolev Inequalities in $L^1$ norm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the $L^1$ Stein-Weiss inequalities studied by De N\'{a}poli and Picon [4] in two ways: First we address an open question posed by the authors about whether the cocanceling condition was necessary for some of their Stein-Weiss inequalities. We replace the cocanceling condition with a weaker vanishing moment assumption, and under this assumption extend the $L^1$ Stein-Weiss inequalities to $L^1(|x|^{a } dx)$ data for all positive, non-integer exponents $a$. Second, in relation to integer exponents, while [4] showed that Stein-Weiss fails for $L^1(|x| dx)$ data, we prove a weaker Korn type Hardy-Sobolev inequality. These inequalities were previously inaccessible due to the growth of $|x|$, and we demonstrate a specific example on $\mathbb{R}^2$ of where the original duality estimate by Bousquet and Van Schaftingen [2] for canceling operators can be improved.</description>

      <title>Lie modules analysis of hydrodynamic-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to study nonlinear superpositions of Riemann wave solutions admitted by quasilinear hyperbolic first-order systems of partial differential equations. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of non-elastic wave superpositions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise independent interactions of waves (quasi-rectifiability). In the case of the compressible Euler system, we describe the structure of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields associated with waves. We prove that a certain class of Lie modules associated with a hydrodynamic-type systems can be uniquely transformed into a real Lie algebra in an angle-preserving manner. For the Euler system, we then demonstrate the connection between the transformed finite-dimensional Lie algebra and the infinite-dimensional algebra associated with waves. This enables a detailed investigation of the geometry of wave superpositions using tools from differential geometry and Lie group theory. In particular, we study the geometry of the manifold of wave superpositions in terms of deformations of submanifolds corresponding to Lie subalgebras associated with waves. Additionally, we present new methods and criteria for determining the quasi-rectifiability of Riemann k-waves.</description>

      <title>Removable sets for pseudoconvexity for weakly smooth boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for bounded domains in $\mathbb C^n$ with $\mathcal C^{1,1}$ smooth boundary, if there is a closed set $F$ of $2n-1$-Lebesgue measure $0$ such that $\partial \Omega \setminus F$ is $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth and locally pseudoconvex at every point, then $\Omega$ is globally pseudoconvex. Unlike in the globally $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth case, the condition ``$F$ of (relative) empty interior'' is not enough to obtain such a result. We also give some results under peak-set type hypotheses, which in particular provide a new proof of an old result of Grauert and Remmert about removable sets for pseudoconvexity under minimal hypotheses of boundary regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation were introduced by Lions and Crandall. For Tonelli Hamiltonians, these solutions are generated by the Lax-Oleinik operator. It is known that this operator converges in the autonomous framework, but this convergence fails in the general cases. In this paper, we introduce a method to construct smooth, recurrent, non-periodic viscosity solutions on fixed compact manifolds $M$ of dimension 2 or higher. Additionally, we provide a detailed description of the non-wandering set of the Lax-Oleinik operator and identify its action on various omega-limit sets.</description>
