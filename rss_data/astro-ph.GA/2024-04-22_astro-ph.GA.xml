      <title>SED Analysis of the Old Open Cluster NGC 188</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the fundamental astrophysical parameters of the old open cluster NGC 188 through two complementary methods: isochron-fitting and spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis. Using photometric, astrometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3, we identify 868 most likely member stars with membership probabilities $P \geq 0.5$. The mean proper-motion components and trigonometric parallaxes of the cluster are derived as ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos \delta$, $\mu_{\delta}$) = (-$2.314 \pm 0.002$, -$1.022 \pm 0.002$) mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\varpi = 0.550 \pm 0.023$, respectively. From this initial selection of high probable member stars, we proceed with the determination of astrophysical parameters using the isochron-fitting method. Simultaneously estimating the colour excess, distance, and age of the cluster, we employee PARSEC isochrones to observational data on Gaia based colour-magnitude diagrams. These findings were obtained as $E(G_{BP}-G_{RP})=0.066\pm 0.012$ mag, $d=1806 \pm21$ pc, and $t=7.65 \pm 1.00$ Gyr, respectively. Additionally, we identify and detected 19 previously confirmed blue straggler stars within NGC 188. Subsequently, we performed SED analyses for 412 out of the 868 cluster members. We obtained colour excess, distance and age of the cluster as $E(B-V)=0.034\pm 0.030$ mag, $d=1854\pm 148$ pc, and $t=7.78\pm 0.23$ Gyr, respectively. The analysis of member stars was revealed patterns of extinction in the $V$-band, with higher values of A(V) observed in the lower right quadrant of the cluster. By comparing our results of SED analysis with models of stellar evolution, particularly in terms of temperature and surface gravity, we confirm agreement with theoretical predictions. This comprehensive investigation sheds light on the astrophysical properties of NGC 188, contributing to our understanding of stellar evolution within open clusters.</description>

      <title>Medium Bands, Mega Science: a JWST/NIRCam Medium-Band Imaging Survey of Abell 2744</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the "Medium Bands, Mega Science" JWST Cycle 2 survey (JWST-GO-4111) and demonstrate the power of these data to reveal both the spatially-integrated and spatially-resolved properties of galaxies from the local universe to the era of cosmic dawn. Executed in November 2023, MegaScience obtained ~30 arcmin^2 of deep multiband NIRCam imaging centered on the z~0.3 Abell 2744 cluster, including eleven medium-band filters and the two shortest-wavelength broad-band filters, F070W and F090W. Together, MegaScience and the UNCOVER Cycle 1 treasury program provide a complete set of deep (~28-30 mag) images in all NIRCam medium- and broad-band filters. This unique dataset allows us to precisely constrain photometric redshifts, map stellar populations and dust attenuation for large samples of distant galaxies, and examine the connection between galaxy structures and formation histories. MegaScience also includes ~17 arcmin^2 of NIRISS parallel imaging in two broad-band and four medium-band filters from 0.9-4.8um, expanding the footprint where robust spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is possible. We provide example SEDs and multi-band cutouts at a variety of redshifts, and use a catalog of JWST spectroscopic redshifts to show that MegaScience improves both the scatter and catastrophic outlier rate of photometric redshifts by factors of 2-3. Additionally, we demonstrate the spatially-resolved science enabled by MegaScience by presenting maps of the [OIII] line emission and continuum emission in three spectroscopically-confirmed z&gt;6 galaxies. We show that line emission in reionization-era galaxies can be clumpy, extended, and spatially offset from continuum emission, implying that galaxy assembly histories are complex even at these early epochs. We publicly release fully reduced mosaics and photometric catalogs for both the NIRCam primary and NIRISS parallel fields.</description>

      <title>Strong-lensing and kinematic analysis of CASSOWARY 31: can strong lensing constrain the masses of multi-plane lenses?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mass measurement for the secondary lens along the line of sight (LoS) in the multi-plane strong lens modeling of the group-scale lens CASSOWARY 31 (CSWA 31). The secondary lens at redshift $z = 1.49$ is a spiral galaxy well aligned along the LoS with the main lens at $z = 0.683$. Using the MUSE integral-field spectroscopy of this spiral galaxy, we measure its rotation velocities and determine the mass from the gas kinematics. We compare the mass estimation of the secondary lens from the lensing models to the mass measurement from kinematics, finding that the predictions from strong lensing tend to be higher. By introducing an additional lens plane at $z = 1.36$ for an overdensity known to be present, we find a mass of $\simeq 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ enclosed within 3.3 kpc from the centroid of the spiral galaxy, approaching the estimate from kinematics. This shows that secondary-lens mass measurements from multiple-plane modeling are affected by systematic uncertainties from the degeneracies between lens planes and the complex LoS structure. Conducting a detailed analysis of the LoS structures is therefore essential to improve the mass measurement of the secondary lens.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in Interstellar Cloud-Cloud and Wind-Cloud Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) is a key ingredient of galaxies and their evolution, consisting of multiphase, turbulent dust and gas. Some of the star-forming regions in our Galaxy originate from cloud-cloud and wind-cloud collisions, which generate shock waves that change the physical and chemical properties of the gas. We utilise our own python-based shock-finding algorithm to study the properties and distribution of shocks in interstellar collisions. Such interactions are studied via 3D numerical simulations with different initial conditions: Cloud-cloud collisions (CCc): We identify four stages of evolution: pre-collision, compression, pass-through, and dissipation. We also vary the size of one of the colliding clouds. Larger clouds facilitate cloud erosion and the formation of more and stronger shocks at early stages. Shock distributions are also time-dependent, as strong shocks are only produced during the early stages. As the collisions evolve, turbulent kinetic energy is rapidly dissipated, so most perturbations become subsonic waves at late times. Wind-cloud collisions (WCc): we identify four stages: compression, stripping, expansion, and break-up. We study the evolution of several diagnostics in these clouds: energies (thermal and kinetic), temperature, displacement of the centre of mass, and mass-weighted averages of the cloud density and acceleration. We show, that the geometry of the cloud impact the diagnostic parameters, for example, smoothing the edges of the cloud leads to enhanced mass losses and dispersion, but has little impact on the shock distribution.</description>

      <title>Stacking X-ray Observations of "Little Red Dots": Implications for their AGN Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent {\em James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)} observations have revealed a population of compact extragalactic objects at $z\gtrsim4$ with red near-infrared colors, which have been dubbed as ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). The spectroscopically-selected LRDs exhibit broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, which has led to the conclusion that type-I active galactic nuclei (AGN) are harbored in the galaxies' dust-reddened cores. However, other mechanisms, like strong outflowing winds, could also produce broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, and thus, the nature of LRDs is still under debate. In this work, we test the AGN hypothesis for LRDs by stacking the archival {\em Chandra} observations of 19 spectroscopically-selected LRDs. We obtain non-detections in both the soft $(0.5-2\text{ keV})$ and the hard $(2-8\text{ keV})$ X-ray band after stacking, and put upper limits on the X-ray luminosities of these LRDs. We find that the soft band upper limit is $\sim1$ dex lower than the expected level from the $L_\text{X}-L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ relation, while the hard band upper limit is consistent with this relation. This result suggests that LRDs and typical type-I AGNs have significantly different properties. We consider it unlikely that absorption is the main reason for the observed low $L_\text{X}/L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ ratios of LRDs. Alternatively, we discuss two plausible hypotheses: (1) LRDs have intrinsically weak X-ray emissions, (2) fast, galactic-scale outflows have a major contribution to the observed broad H$\alpha$ lines. Our findings indicate that empirical relations (e.g., for black hole mass measurements) established for typical type-I AGNs should be used with caution when analyzing the properties of LRDs.</description>

      <title>Stellar Abundances at the Center of Early Type Galaxies with Fine Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of early-type galaxies (ETGs) has grown in the past decade with the advance of full-spectrum fitting techniques used to infer the properties of the stellar populations that make-up the galaxy. We present ages, central velocity dispersions, and abundance ratios relative to Fe of C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Ba, and Eu, derived using full-spectrum fitting techniques for three ETGs NGC 2865, NGC 3818, and NGC 4915. Each of these three galaxies were selected because they have optical, disturbed structures (fine structure) that are linked to major merger events that occurred 1, 7, and 6 Gyr ago, respectively. Two of the ETGs, NGC 3818 and NGC 4915, show chemical signatures similar to ETGs without fine structure, which is consistent with a gas-poor merger of elliptical galaxies in which substantial star formation is not expected. For NGC 2865, we find a statistically higher abundance of Ca (an $\alpha$-element) and Cr and Mn (Fe-peak elements). We show that for NGC 2865, a simple gas-rich merger scenario fails to explain the larger abundance ratios compared to ETGs without fine structure. These three early-type galaxies with fine structure exhibit a range of abundances, suggesting ETGs with fine structure can form via multiple pathways and types of galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>Galactic Superbubbles in 3D: Wind Formation and Cloud Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic superbubbles are triggered by stellar feedback in the discs of star-forming galaxies. They are important in launching galactic winds, which play a key role in regulating the mass and energy exchange in galaxies. Observations can only reveal projected information and the 3D structure of such winds is quite complex. Therefore, numerical simulations are required to further our understanding of such structures. Here, we describe hydrodynamical simulations targeting two spatial scales. Large-scale superbubble models reveal supernova-driven outflows, and their subsequent merging, which leads to galactic wind formation. Additionally, the turbulence parameter $\sigma_t$ not only affects disc formation, but also influences mass and energy characteristics, controlling gas distribution and the injection rate in the simulated star formation zone. Small-scale wind-multicloud models indicate that isolated clouds are susceptible to instabilities, leading to fragmentation and dense gas destruction. In contrast, in closer cloud configurations, the condensation mechanism becomes important owing to hydrodynamic shielding, which helps to maintain the cold material throughout the evolution of the system. These simulations provide a comprehensive picture of galactic winds, showing how large-scale superbubble dynamics create the environment where small-scale wind-multicloud interactions shape the interstellar and circumgalactic media, ultimately regulating galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>An ALMA search for substructure and fragmentation in starless cores in Orion B North</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle 3 observations of 73 starless and protostellar cores in the Orion B North molecular cloud. We detect a total of 34 continuum sources at 106 GHz, and after comparisons with other data, 4 of these sources appear to be starless. Three of the four sources are located near groupings of protostellar sources, while one source is an isolated detection. We use synthetic observations of a simulation modeling a collapsing turbulent, magnetized core to compute the expected number of starless cores that should be detectable with our ALMA observations and find at least two (1.52) starless core should be detectable, consistent with our data. We run a simple virial analysis of the cores to put the Orion B North observations into context with similar previous ALMA surveys of cores in Chamaeleon I and Ophiuchus. We conclude that the Chamaeleon I starless core population is characteristically less bounded than the other two populations, along with external pressure contributions dominating the binding energy of the cores. These differences may explain why the Chamaeleon I cores do not follow turbulent model predictions, while the Ophiuchus and Orion B North cores are consistent with the model.</description>

      <title>The relationship of SMBHs and host galaxies at $z&lt;4$ in the deep optical variability-selected AGN sample in the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the study on the relationship between SMBHs and their host galaxies using our variability-selected AGN sample ($i_\mathrm{AB} \leq 25.9,\ z \leq 4.5$) constructed from the HSC-SSP Ultra-deep survey in the COSMOS field. We estimated the BH mass ($M_\mathrm{BH}=10^{5.5-10}\ M_{\odot}$) based on the single-epoch virial method and the total stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{star}=10^{10-12}\ M_{\odot}$) by separating the AGN component with SED fitting. We found that the redshift evolution of the BH-stellar mass ratio ($M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{star}$) depends on the $M_\mathrm{BH}$ which is caused by the no significant correlation between $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and $M_\mathrm{star}$. Variable AGNs with massive SMBHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}&gt;10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$) at $1.5&lt;z&lt;3$ show considerably higher BH-stellar mass ratios ($&gt;\sim1\%$) than the BH-bulge ratios ($M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\mathrm{bulge}$) observed in the local universe for the same BH range. This implies that there is a typical growth path of massive SMBHs which is faster than the formation of the bulge component as final products seen in the present day. For the low-mass SMBHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}&lt;10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$) at $0.5&lt;z&lt;3$, on the other hand, variable AGNs show the similar BH-stellar mass ratios with the local objects ($\sim 0.1\%$) but smaller than those observed at $z &gt; 4$. We interpret that host galaxies harboring less massive SMBHs at intermediate redshift have already acquired sufficient stellar mass, although high-z galaxies are still in the early stage of galaxy formation relative to those at the intermediate/local universe.</description>

      <title>The Lockman--SpReSO project. Main properties of infrared selected star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods.We applied distinct selection criteria to attain an SFG sample with minimal AGN contamination. Multiple approaches were used to estimate the intrinsic extinction, SFR and gas-phase metallicity for the SFGs. In conjunction with findings in the literature, we examined the correlation between SFRs and stellar masses ($M_*$), as well as the metallicity evolution depending on $M_*$. Finally, the 3D relationship between $M_*$, SFR and metallicity, is also studied.} Results. From the initial spectroscopic sample of 409 FIR-selected objects from the Lockman--SpReSO catalogue, 69 (17\%) AGNs have been identified and excluded, which is nearly double the percentage found in local studies, leaving a sample of 340 SFGs. The analysis of the $M_*$--SFR relationship revealed that Lockman--SpReSO IR-selected SFGs show signs of evolution at redshifts $z&gt;0.4$, shifting above the main sequence, with a mean value of $\sim0.4$ dex. They are located within the starburst galaxy region since 78\% of the galaxies fall into this category. In addition, no evident flattening was found in the relation to specific SFR with redshift for $\log M_* (M_\odot) \gtrsim 10.5$. In line with the $M_*$--metallicity relation (MZR) outcomes published in previous studies for optically selected SFGs, however, during the analysis of the MZR, it was found that IR-selected SFGs exhibit lower metallicities than those anticipated on the basis of their $M_*$ and redshift. During the investigation of the 3D $M_*$--SFR--metallicity relation (FP), it was established that the research sample is consistent with relations in the existing literature, with an average scatter of $\sim0.2$ dex. However, a re-calibration of the FP when using the SFR obtained from the IR luminosity is required and, in this case, no attenuation in the correlation for $\log M_* (M_\odot) \gtrsim 10.5$ is observed.</description>

      <title>Open Cluster Dynamics under the Influence of Outflow-Ambient Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflowing stars impinging upon ambient gas experience accelerations due to the gravitational feedback from the morphology of the interaction betweem the outflow and the ambient gas. Such "negative dynamical friction" (NDF), in contrast to the conventional "dynamical friction" (DF), is studied for its impact on the dynamics of open clusters immersed in a uniform ambient gas. We modify the $N$-body integration code REBOUND with both NDF and DF implemented according to the outflow conditions of each star in a consistently constructed model open cluster. The evolution of stars is also involved in determining the gas-star interactions throughout their stellar lives. Compared to DF-only and gas-free models with identical initial conditions, the NDF-affected cluster is puffier and evaporates faster, as indicated by various diagnostics, including lower velocity dispersions and larger half-mass and half-light radii. Neutron stars with fast winds are expelled from the cluster due to their intensive NDF effect, even without the "kicks" by asymmetric supernovae. Exploration of parameter space confirms that the NDF effect is generally enhanced with higher ambient gas densities, in qualitatively agreement with the expression of acceleration. Outflow-ambient interactions should be considered for the proper interpretation of the evolution of stellar dynamics in clusters.</description>

      <title>Photometric Re-calibration of VPHAS+ $u$-band Photometry with the Stellar Colour Regression Method and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The u band magnitude is vital for determining stellar parameters and investigating specific astronomical objects. However, flux calibration in the u band for stars in the Galactic disk presents significant challenges. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive re-calibration of $u$-band photometric magnitudes of the VPHAS+ Data Release 4 (DR4), employing the Stellar Colour Regression (SCR) technique. By leveraging the expansive set of XP spectra and $G_{\rm BP}$ photometry from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), as well as the individual stellar extinction values provided by the literature, we have obtained precise model magnitudes of nearly 3 million stars. Our analysis identifies systematic magnitude offsets that exhibit a standard deviation of 0.063 mag across different observational visits, 0.022 mag between various CCDs, and 0.009 mag within pixel bins. We have implemented precise corrections for these observational visits, CCD chips, and pixel bins-dependent magnitude offsets. These corrections have led to a reduction in the standard deviation between the observed magnitudes and the model magnitudes from 0.088 mag to 0.065 mag, ensuring that the calibrated magnitudes are independent of stellar magnitude, colour, and extinction. The enhanced precision of these magnitudes substantially improves the quality of astrophysical research and offers substantial potential for furthering our understanding of stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Finding accreted stars in the Milky Way: clues from NIHAO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the marks left by galactic accretion in the Milky Way helps us understand how our Galaxy was formed. However, finding and studying accreted stars and the galaxies they came from has been challenging. This study uses a simulation from the NIHAO project, which now includes a wider range of chemical compositions, to find better ways to spot these accreted stars. By comparing our findings with data from the GALAH spectroscopic survey, we confirm that the observationally established diagnostics of [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] also show a separation of in-situ and accreted stars in the simulation, but stars from different accretion events tend to overlap in this plane even without observational uncertainties. Looking at the relationship between stellar age and linear or logarithmic abundances, such as [Fe/H], we can clearly separate different groups of these stars if the uncertainties in their chemical makeup are less than 0.15 dex and less than 20% for their ages. This method shows promise for studying the history of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Our work highlights how important it is to have accurate measurements of stellar ages and chemical content. It also shows how simulations can help us understand the complex process of galaxies merging and suggest how these events might relate to the differences we see between our Galaxy's thin and thick disk stars. This study provides a way to compare theoretical models with real observations, opening new paths for research in both our own Galaxy and beyond.</description>

      <title>The effect of local photoionization on the galaxy properties and the circumgalactic medium in simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of local stellar radiation in cosmological zoom simulations of the formation of Milky Way-sized galaxies. We include the radiation field as an additional feedback component that is computed alongside gravity with a tree code in an optically thin approximation. We resimulate the initial conditions of five Milk Way-like systems taken from the Auriga project with and without stellar radiation, and study the effects of local stellar radiation on several properties of the galaxies and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Similar to previous findings, we observe that local stellar radiation can modify gas cooling in the circumgalactic medium and thus suppress star formation and the surface densities of young stars and HI gas, while having little impact on the total gas content. Even though the magnitude of the effect we find is smaller than reported in earlier work, the radiation field is thus clearly an important component in simulations of late time galaxies. In particular, it also suppresses the peak of the rotation curve and reduces the mass of the stellar bulge. In the CGM region, the young stellar radiation exceeds the external UVB and dominates the radiation field within the virial halo at all redshifts. Nevertheless, we find that the local stellar radiation has overall little impact on the radial density and temperature profile of the CGM gas. The metallicity profile is slightly reduced, however, as well as the HI and MgII column densities within $\sim 0.3\,R_{\rm vir}$. In contrast, we find that the OVI column density is hardly impacted by the radiation field. Additional effects can be expected from the radiation of the central AGN during phases of quasar activity, which has not yet been included in the simulations of the present study.</description>

      <title>Extraction of YSO Cores and Active Regions near Star-forming Site AFGL 5157</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a quantitative analysis of the $1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$ region near star-forming site AFGL 5157 using 'Minimal Spanning Tree' (MST). The analysis reveals that this region consists of five major clusters. The cluster radii of the cores and active regions were found to be varying between 0.75-2.62 pc and 2.77-4.58 pc, respectively, for these regions, while the aspect ratio varies between 0.71 to 7.17. This hints towards the clumpy as well as elongated clusters in the region. We calculated structure parameter Q for each region which varies between 0.41-0.62 and 0.23-0.81 for the cores and ARs, respectively. This shows the existence of fractal distribution in all the cores and ARs except the core of the [HKS2019] E70 bubble.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Kinematics of IZw18: A Detailed Study of Ionized Gas with MEGARA/GTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the intricate kinematic behavior of ionized gas within IZw18, a galaxy known for its remarkably low metallicity and proximity. Leveraging data from MEGARA/GTC, we meticulously analyzed the galaxy's structure and dynamics using H{\alpha} line profiles. Employing single and double Gaussian component fittings, we generated detailed maps of luminosity, velocity, and velocity dispersion across both the main body (MB) and Halo regions. By extracting integrated spectra from various galactic zones, we enhanced the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. In the MB, a clear rotational pattern emerged, supplemented by a more intricate kinematic structure from the double-component fitting, notably featuring a broad component with a FWHM nearing 2000 km/s. This broad component, exhibiting wide spatial extension, hints at a high-energy outflow and suggests non-localized sources of significant kinetic energy. The considerable velocity disparities between narrow and broad components imply potential spatial segregation, possibly due to dense gas near the kinematic origin acting as a momentum-reflection 'wall'. Examining the halos, the NE Halo appears tranquil with low velocity dispersions, while the SW Halo displays higher velocities and complex kinematics, indicative of varied dynamic interactions. The presence of the broad component throughout the MB and the intricate kinematics across all regions suggests widespread and subtle turbulent motion. This nuanced understanding of IZw18's kinematic behavior, elucidating the interplay of gas components and internal structures, enriches our comprehension of dynamics in blue compact dwarf galaxies. It holds promise for shedding light on early galaxy formation and the complex kinematics inherent to such environments.</description>

      <title>The quiescent population at $0.5\le z \le 0.9$: Environmental impact on the mass-size relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How the quiescent galaxies evolve with redshift and the factors that impact their evolution are still debated. It is still unclear what the dominant mechanisms of passive galaxy growth are and what role is played by the environment in shaping their evolutionary paths over cosmic time. Our aim is to study the mass-size relation (MSR) of the quiescent population and to understand how the environment shapes the MSR at intermediate redshift. We used the VIPERS, a large spectroscopic survey of $\sim$90~000 galaxies in the redshift range $0.5\le z \le 1.2$. We selected a mass-complete sample of 4786 passive galaxies based on the NUVrK diagram and refined it using the $D_n4000$ spectral index to study the MSR of the passive population over $0.5\le z \le 0.9$. The impact of the environment on the MSR and on the growth of the quiescent population is studied through the density contrast. The slope and the intercept of the MSR, $\alpha=0.62\pm 0.04$ and $\textrm{log}(A)=0.52\pm 0.01$, agree well with values from the literature at the same redshift. The intercept decreases with redshift, $R_e(z)=8.20\times (1+z)^{-1.70}$, while the slope remains roughly constant, and the same trend is observed in the low-density (LD) and high-density (HD) environments. We find that the average size of the quiescent population in the LD and HD environments are identical within $3\sigma$ and this result is robust against a change in the definition of the LD and HD environments or a change in the selection of quiescent galaxies. In the LD and HD environments, $\sim$30 and $\sim$40% of the population have experienced a minor merger process between $0.5\le z \le 0.9$. However, minor mergers account only for 30 to 40% of the size evolution in this redshift range, the remaining evolution likely being due to the progenitor bias.</description>

      <title>Gaia DR3 detectability of unresolved binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia can not individually resolve very close binary systems, however, the collected data can still be used to identify them. A powerful indicator of stellar multiplicity is the sources reported Renormalized Unit Weight Error (ruwe), which effectively captures the astrometric deviations from single-source solutions. We aim to characterise the imprints left on ruwe caused by binarity. By flagging potential binary systems based on ruwe, we aim to characterise which of their properties will contribute the most to their detectability. We develop a model to estimate ruwe values for observations of Gaia sources, based on the biases to the single-source astrometric track arising from the presence of an unseen companion. Then, using the recipes from previous GaiaUnlimited selection functions, we estimate the selection probability of sources with high ruwe, and discuss what binary properties contribute to increasing the sources ruwe. We compute the maximum ruwe value which is compatible with single-source solutions as a function of their location on-sky. We see that binary systems selected as sources with a ruwe higher than this sky-varying threshold have a strong detectability window in their orbital period distribution, which peaks at periods equal to the Gaia observation time baseline. We demonstrate how our sky-varying ruwe threshold provides a more complete sample of binary systems when compared to single sky-averaged values by studying the unresolved binary population in the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars. We provide the code and tools used in this study, as well as the sky-varying ruwe threshold through the GaiaUnlimited Python package</description>

      <title>X-shooter spectroscopy of Liller1 giant stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive chemical study of a representative sample of 27 luminous red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to Liller 1, a complex stellar system in the Galactic bulge. This study is based on medium-resolution near-infrared spectra acquired with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. We found a subpopulation counting 22 stars with subsolar metallicity ($&lt;$[Fe/H]$&gt;=-0.31\pm0.02$ and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.08 dex) and with enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that likely formed early and quickly from gas that was mainly enriched by type II supernovae, and a metal-rich population counting 5 stars with supersolar metallicity ($&lt;$[Fe/H]$&gt;$=+0.22$\pm$0.03 and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.06 dex) and roughly solar-scaled [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that formed at later epochs from gas that was also enriched by type Ia supernovae. Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [Na/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values. This indicates that mixing and extra-mixing processes during the RGB evolution also occur at very high metallicities. Notably, no evidence of a Na-O anticorrelation, which is considered the fingerprint of genuine globular clusters, has been found. This challenges any formation scenarios that invoke the accretion of a molecular cloud or an additional stellar system onto a genuine globular cluster. The results of this study underline the strong chemical similarity between Liller 1 and Terzan 5 and support the hypothesis that these complex stellar systems might be fossil fragments of the epoch of Galactic bulge formation.</description>

      <title>Kinematic morphology of low-mass galaxies in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of diverse kinematic morphologies observed in low-mass galaxies is unclear. In this study, we investigate the kinematic morphologies of central galaxies with stellar mass $10^{8.5-9.0} M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$ in the TNG50-1 cosmological simulation. The majority of the low-mass galaxies in TNG50-1 are dispersion-dominated, consistent with observations. By tracing the evolutionary histories of simulated low-mass galaxies, we find that while most stars form in rotating cold gas discs, the orientation of the star-forming discs relative to the galaxies may evolve with cosmic time. If the cold gas disc remains aligning with the galaxy during its evolution, stars formed at different times share the same rotational direction, leading to a rotation-dominated system. On the contrary, frequent misalignment of cold gas disc would result in a dispersion-dominated system. In addition, we also find that the two-body scattering can have a non-negligible numerical heating effect on the simulated galaxy morphology, especially at central regions of galaxies and for relatively low-mass galaxies. By comparing results of simulations with different resolutions, our results suggest that the simulated morphology of galaxies is reliable when their number of stellar particles exceeds about $10^{4}$, and bulge morphology of galaxies can not be resolved robustly at the resolution level of TNG50-1.</description>

      <title>The impact of a top-heavy IMF on the formation and evolution of dark star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spitzer instability leads to the formation of a black hole sub-system (BHSub) at the center of a star cluster providing energy to luminous stars (LSs) and increasing their rate of evaporation. When the self-depletion time of the BHSub exceeds the evaporation time of the LSs, a dark star cluster (DSC) will appear. Using the NBODY7 code, we performed a comprehensive set of direct \Nbody simulations over a wide range of initial conditions to study the pure effect of the top-heaviness of the IMF on the formation of the DSC phase. In the Galactic tidal field, top-heavy IMFs lead to the fast evaporation of LSs and the formation of DSCs. Therefore, DSCs can be present even in the outer region of the Milky Way (MW). To successfully transition to the DSC phase, the MW Globular Clusters (GCs) must possess an initial BH mass fraction of $\widetilde{\mathit{M}}_\mathrm{BH}(0)&gt;0.05$. For star clusters with $\widetilde{\mathit{M}}_\mathrm{BH}(0)&gt;0.08$, the DSC phase will be created for any given initial density of the cluster and Galactocentric distance. The duration of the cluster's lifetime spent in the DSC phase shows a negative (positive) correlation with the initial density, and Galactocentric distance of the star cluster if $\widetilde{\mathit{M}}_\mathrm{BH}(0)\leq 0.12$ ($\widetilde{\mathit{M}}_\mathrm{BH}(0)\geq 0.15$). Considering the canonical IMF, it is unlikely for any MW GCs to enter the DSC phase. We discuss the BH retention fraction in view of the observed properties of the GCs of the MW.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman), NASA's next flagship observatory, has significant mission time to be spent on surveys for general astrophysics in addition to its three core community surveys. We considered what types of observations outside the core surveys would most benefit from early definition, given 700 hours of mission time in the first two years of Roman's operation. We recommend that a survey of the Galactic plane be defined early, based on the broad range of stakeholders for such a survey, the added scientific value of a first pass to obtain a baseline for proper motions complementary to Gaia's, and the significant potential synergies with ground-based surveys, notably the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on Rubin. We also found strong motivation to follow a community definition process for ultra-deep observations with Roman.</description>

      <title>Structure formation with primordial black holes to alleviate early star formation tension revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Letter explores the potential role of primordial black holes (PBHs) to address cosmological tensions as the presence of more massive than expected galaxies at high redshifts, as indicated by recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. Motivated by inflation models that enhance the power at scales beyond the observable range that produce PBHs with Schechter-like mass functions, we aim to explain the excess of high redshift galaxies via a modification of the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter power spectrum that consists in adding (i) a blue spectral index $n_b$ at $k_{\text{piv}}=10/$Mpc and (ii) Poisson and isocurvature contributions from massive PBHs that only make up $0.5\%$ of the dark matter.We simulated these models using the SWIFT code and find an increased abundance of high redshift galaxies in simulations that include PBHs. We compared these models to estimates from James Webb Space Telescope observations.Unlike the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, the inclusion of PBHs allowed us to reproduce the the observations with reasonable values for the star formation efficiency. Furthermore, the power spectra we adopted potentially produce PBHs that can serve as seeds for supermassive black holes with masses $7.57 \times 10^4 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new set of four-geometries exhibiting asymptotically flat galactic rotation curves. These are found as explicit solutions to 5D vacuum Hilbert-Palatini theory, where the fifth dimen sion has vanishing proper length. In the emergent 4D dynamics, governed by the condition that the Ricci scalar must vanish (upto a cosmological constant), these correspond to anisotropic effective pressure. The enhancement in the deflection angle of a light ray penetrating the halo is obtained, which could provide a realistic testing ground for the model as a purely geometric alternative to `dark matter'. For very large halo radii, the leading nonbaryonic contribution to the bending angle is predicted to be $3\pi v^2/2c^2$ (v being the asymptotic rotational velocity), a constant that is different from the result for an isothermal CDM halo.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope \mbox{(AtLAST)} Science: Probing the Transient and Time-variable Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of transient and variable events, including novae, active galactic nuclei, and black hole binaries, has historically been a fruitful path for elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms of our universe. The study of such events in the millimeter and submillimeter is, however, still in its infancy. Submillimeter observations probe a variety of materials, such as optically thick dust, which are hard to study in other wavelengths. Submillimeter observations are sensitive to a number of emission mechanisms, from the aforementioned cold dust, to hot free-free emission, and synchrotron emission from energetic particles. Study of these phenomena has been hampered by a lack of prompt, high sensitivity submillimeter follow-up, as well as by a lack of high-sky-coverage submillimeter surveys. In this paper, we describe how the proposed Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) could fill in these gaps in our understanding of the transient universe. We discuss a number of science cases that would benefit from AtLAST observations, and detail how AtLAST is uniquely suited to contributing to them. In particular, AtLAST's large field of view will enable serendipitous detections of transient events, while its anticipated ability to get on source quickly and observe simultaneously in multiple bands make it also ideally suited for transient follow-up. We make theoretical predictions for the instrumental and observatory properties required to significantly contribute to these science cases, and compare them to the projected AtLAST capabilities. Finally, we consider the unique ways in which transient science cases constrain the observational strategies of AtLAST, and make prescriptions for how AtLAST should observe in order to maximize its transient science output without impinging on other science cases.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the atmospheric parameters of stars on the top of the RGB is essential to reveal the chemical composition of the Milky Way, as they can be used to probe the farthest parts of our Galaxy. Our goal is to determine the chemical composition of 21 RGB stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;4200$K selected from the APOGEE-2 DR17 database using new observations carried out with the spectrograph mounted on the 1-m telescope of the Hungarian Piszk\'estet\H{o} Observatory and the SONG spectrograph (R=77000) on the Hertzsprung SONG telescope in the 4500$-$5800\r{A} wavelength range. This is the first time the spectrograph (R=18000) on the 1-m telescope at Piszk\'estet\H{o} Observatory was used to measure the abundances of stars. We created a new LTE spectral library using MARCS model atmospheres and SYNSPEC by including the line list of 23 molecules to determine atmospheric parameters ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe]) and abundances of Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Ni with FERRE. The resulting parameters were compared to that of APOGEE. We found a good agreement in general, the average difference is $-$11.2K in $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, 0.11dex in $\log g$, 0.10dex in [Fe/H], and $-$0.01dex in [$\alpha$/Fe]. Our analysis successfully demonstrates the ability of the spectrograph at Piszk\'estet\H{o} Observatory to reliably measure the abundance of bright stars.</description>

      <title>New Evidence of Binarity in Young {\alpha}-Rich Turn-off and Subgiant Stars: Fast Rotation and Strong Magnetic Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13562</link>

Abstract: Young {\alpha}-rich (YAR) stars within the old Galactic thick disk exhibit a dual characteristic of relative youth determined with asteroseismology and abundance enhancement in {\alpha} elements measured from high-resolution spectroscopy. The youth origin of YAR stars has been proposed to be binary evolution via mass transfer or stellar mergers. If that is the case, YAR stars should spin rapidly and thus be magnetically active, because they are mass and angular momentum gainers. In this study, to seek this binary footprint we select YAR stars on the main-sequence turn-off or the subgiant branch (MSTO-SGB) from APOGEE DR17, whose ages and projected rotation velocities (vsini) can be precisely measured. With APOGEE vsini and LAMOST spectra, we find that YAR stars are indeed fast rotators and magnetically active. In addition, we observe low [C/N] ratios and high Gaia RUWE in some YAR stars, suggesting that these MSTO-SGB stars probably have experienced mass transfer from red-giant companions. Our findings underscore that magnetic activity can serve as a valuable tool for probing the binary evolution for other chemically peculiar stars, such as red giants with lithium anomalies and carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars.</description>

      <title>Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, regarded as a contaminant in weak lensing analyses, represents the correlation of galaxy shapes due to gravitational tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. As such, understanding IA is paramount for accurate cosmological inferences from weak lensing surveys; however, one limitation to our understanding and mitigation of IA is expensive simulation-based modeling. In this work, we present a deep learning approach to emulate galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation function measurements and uncertainties from halo occupation distribution-based mock galaxy catalogs. We find strong Pearson correlation values with the model across all three correlation functions and further predict aleatoric uncertainties through a mean-variance estimation training procedure. $\xi(r)$ predictions are generally accurate to $\leq10\%$. Our model also successfully captures the underlying signal of the noisier correlations $\omega(r)$ and $\eta(r)$, although with a lower average accuracy. We find that the model performance is inhibited by the stochasticity of the data, and will benefit from correlations averaged over multiple data realizations. Our code will be made open source upon journal publication.</description>

      <title>Reproducible empirical evidence of cosmological-scale asymmetry in galaxy spin directions: comment on arXiv:2404.06617</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of the spin directions of galaxies has been a question in the past decade, with numerous Earth-based and space-based experiments showing that the distribution is not necessarily random. These experiments were based on different statistical methods, one of them was a simple and empirically verified open source $\chi^2$ method. Patel &amp; Desmond (2024) proposed that previous experiments showing non-random distribution are flawed since they assume Gaussian distribution. To address that, they apply a new complex ad-hoc statistical method to several datasets, none of them except for one were used in the past to claim for a dipole axis. The new method showed that all datasets except for one exhibit isotropy. This paper discusses the soundness of the contention that Gaussian distribution cannot be assumed for galaxy spin directions. More importantly, simple empirical analyses show that the new statistical method is not fully responsive to asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions, and does not identify non-random distribution even in situations where a dipole axis clearly exists in the data, or when an artificial bias is added to the data to create an extremely non-random dataset. Results using Monte Carlo simulation show substantial differences between the results of the simulation and the results of the new statistical method. Code and data to reproduce the experiments are available, and released in a manner that is easily reproducible. Possible reasons leading to the results are also discussed. The claims that the actual results are different from the results reported in the papers are examined in an open and transparent manner. These claims are found to be inaccurate, as the previous literature results are fully reproducible. These findings further reinforce the need to study astrophysical or cosmological explanations for the non-random distribution.</description>

      <title>Protostellar spin-up and fast rotator formation through binary star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Edited) Many fast rotator stars (rotation periods of &lt; 2 days) are found in unresolved binaries with separations of tens of au. This correlation leads to the question of whether the formation of binary stars inherently produces fast rotators. We aim to understand whether the formation of companions plays a role in spinning up stars. We use magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of multiple star systems from turbulent and non-turbulent protostellar cores. We track the angular momentum accreted by individual star and inner disc systems by using a sink particle technique. We run a resolution study to extrapolate protostellar properties. We find in all simulations that the primary star can experience spin-up events that are correlated with the formation of companions. The primary star can spin up by up to 84% of its pre-fragmentation angular momentum and by up to 18% of its pre-fragmentation mass-specific angular momentum. The mechanism for the spin-up is gravitational disc instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star, leading to the accretion of material with high specific angular momentum. The simulations that experience the strongest disc instabilities fragment to form companions. Simulations with weaker spin-up events experience disc instabilities triggered by a companion flyby, and the disc instability in these cases does not produce further fragments. We conclude that the primary star in multiple star systems may end up with a higher spin than single stars. This is because gravitational instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star can trigger a spin-up event. In the strongest spin-up events, the instability is likely to cause disc fragmentation and the formation of companions. This companion formation coupled with shorter disc lifetimes, because the companion truncates the circumstellar disc, can help produce fast rotators.</description>

      <title>Investigation of [KSF2015] 1381-19L, a WC9-type star in the high extinction Galactic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a multi-wavelength study of the Wolf Rayet (WR) star: [KSF2015] 1381-19L, which is located in the solar metallicity region (Z=0.014) of the Milky Way Galaxy, strongly obscured by the interstellar dust. We perform a detailed characterization of the stellar atmosphere by fitting the spectral emission lines observed in the Optical and Near-InfraRed (NIR) bands, using CMFGEN. The best-fitted spectroscopic model indicates a highly luminous ($10^{5.89}L_{\odot}$) star with a larger radius ($15\,R_{\odot}$) and effective temperature, wind terminal velocity, and chemical composition similar to that of Galactic WC9-dusty (WC9d)-type stars. The atmospheric ionization structure shows coexisting ionization states of different elements, simultaneously affecting the opacity and thermal electron balance. Fitting of the spectral energy data (SED) reveals high interstellar optical extinction ($A_{V}=$ 8.87) while the IR extinction is found to be comparatively lower ($A_{K_{s}}=$ 0.98). We do not detect any excess emission at near-IR wavelengths due to dust. Upon comparison of our results with the GENEVA single star evolutionary models (Z=0.014), we identify the best possible progenitors ( a rotating star of $67\,M_{\odot}$ and a non-rotating star of $90\,M_{\odot}$).</description>

      <title>Observational characterisation of large-scale transport and horizontal turbulent diffusivity in the quiet Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun is a magnetic star, and the only spatio-temporally resolved astrophysical system displaying turbulent MHD thermal convection. This makes it a privileged object of study to understand fluid turbulence in extreme regimes and its interactions with magnetic fields. Global analyses of high-resolution solar observations provided by the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory can shed light on the physical processes underlying large-scale emergent phenomena such as the solar dynamo cycle. Combining a Coherent Structure Tracking reconstruction of photospheric flows, based on photometric data, and a statistical analysis of virtual passive tracers trajectories advected by these flows, we characterise one of the most important such processes, turbulent diffusion, over an unprecedentedly long monitoring period of 6 consecutive days of a significant fraction of the solar disc. We first confirm, and provide a new global view of the emergence of a remarkable dynamical pattern of Lagrangian Coherent Structures tiling the entire surface. These structures act as transport barriers on the time and spatial scale of supergranulation and, by transiently accumulating particles and magnetic fields, regulate large-scale turbulent surface diffusion. We then further statistically characterise the turbulent transport regime using two different methods, and obtain an effective horizontal turbulent diffusivity $D=2-3\times10^8~\mathrm{m}^2~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ on the longest timescales probed. This estimate is consistent with the transport coefficients required in large-scale mean-field solar dynamo models, and is in broad agreement with the results of global simulations. Our analysis may also have implications for understanding the connections between solar-surface, coronal and solar-wind dynamics, and provides valuable lessons to characterise turbulent transport in other, unresolved turbulent astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>A covariant formulation for cosmological radiative transfer of the 21-cm line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen is a useful tool to probe the conditions of the Universe during the Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn, and the Epoch of Reionisation. In most of the current calculations, the 21-cm line signals at given frequencies are computed, using an integrated line-of-sight line opacity, with the correction for cosmological expansion. These calculations have not fully captured the line and continuum interactions in the radiative transfer, in response to evolution of the radiation field and the variations of thermal and dynamic properties of the line-of-sight medium. We construct a covariant formulation for the radiative transfer of the 21-cm line and derive the cosmological 21-cm line radiative transfer (C21LRT) equation. The formulation properly accounts for local emission and absorption processes and the interaction between the line and continuum when the radiation propagates across the expanding Universe to the present observer. Our C21LRT calculations show that methods simply summing the line optical depth could lead to error of $5\%$ in the 21-cm signals for redshift $z \sim 12-35$ and of $&gt;10\%$ for redshift $z \lesssim 8$. Proper covariant radiative transfer is therefore necessary for producing correct theoretical templates for extracting information of the structural evolution of the Universe through the Epoch of Reionisation from the 21-cm tomographic data.</description>

      <title>Ciii]$\lambda1909$ emission as an alternative to Ly$\alpha$ in the reionization era: the dependence of Ciii] and Ly$\alpha$ at $3&lt;z&lt;4$ from the VANDELS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The velocity offset of Ly$\alpha$ emission from a galaxy's systemic redshift is an excellent tracer of conditions that enable the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons from the galaxy, and potentially hydrogen ionizing Lyman continuum photons. However at $z\geq6$, Ly$\alpha$ is often heavily attenuated by the neutral intergalactic medium. Here we investigate the utility of Ciii],$\lambda\lambda1907,1909$ emission, usually the brightest UV line after Ly$\alpha$, as a proxy estimating the Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset ($\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$). To do so, we use analogues of reionization era galaxies based upon 52 star-forming galaxies with robust Ciii] detections drawn from the VANDELS survey. Our sample spans a broad UV magnitude range of $-18.5 &lt; M_{\rm{UV}} &lt; -22.0$, with a sample average value of EW(Ciii]) $=5.3$\,{\AA}. We find a slight increase of EW(Ciii]) with increasing EW(Ly$\alpha$), but find a large range of EW(Ciii]) $\sim$1-13\,{\AA} particularly at EW(Ly$\alpha$) $&lt;10$\,{\AA}. Using the Ciii] line peak as the systemic redshift, we calculate $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ and recover the previously reported trend of decreasing $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ with increasing EW(Ly$\alpha$). Interestingly, we find an anti-correlation between $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ and EW(Ciii]), which also displays a dependence on the UV absolute magnitude. We derive a multi-variate fit to obtain $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ using both EW(Ciii]) and $M_{\rm{UV}}$, finding that $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$ is more strongly dependent on EW(Ciii]), with a weaker but non-negligible dependence on $M_{\rm{UV}}$. We find that for a fixed EW(Ciii]), UV-bright Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies show smaller values of $\Delta v_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$,which suggests that such galaxies may be undergoing more bursty star-formation compared to the UV-fainter ones, akin to a population of extremely UV-bright galaxies identified at $z&gt;10$.</description>

Abstract: Our goal is to study the gravitational effects caused by the passage of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) in its orbit on the stellar halo of the Milky Way (MW). We employed the Gaia Data Release 3 to construct a halo tracers data set consisting of K-Giant stars and RR-Lyrae variables. Additionally, we have compared the data with a theoretical model to estimate the DM subhalo mass. We have improved the characterisation of the local wake and the collective response due to the LMC orbit. On the other hand, we have estimated for the first time the dark subhalo mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud, of the order of $1.7\times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, comparable to previously reported values in the literature.</description>

      <title>Atomic Hydrogen Shows its True Colours: Correlations between HI and Galaxy Colour in Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity mapping experiments are beginning to measure the spatial distribution of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) to constrain cosmological parameters and the large-scale distribution of matter. However, models of the behaviour of HI as a tracer of matter are complicated by galaxy evolution. In this work, we examine the clustering of HI in relation to galaxy colour, stellar mass, and HI mass in IllustrisTNG at $z$ = 0, 0.5, and 1. We compare the HI-red and HI-blue galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that HI-red has an amplitude 1.5 times higher than HI-blue at large scales. The cross-power spectra intersect at $\approx 3$ Mpc in real space and $\approx 10$ Mpc in redshift space, consistent with $z \approx 0$ observations. We show that HI clustering increases with galaxy HI mass and depends weakly on detection limits in the range $M_{\mathrm{HI}} \leq 10^8 M_\odot$. In terms of $M_\star$, we find blue galaxies in the greatest stellar mass bin cluster more than blue galaxies in other stellar mass bins. Red galaxies in the greatest stellar mass bin, however, cluster the weakest amongst red galaxies. These trends arise due to central-satellite compositions. Centrals correlate less with HI for increasing stellar mass, whereas satellites correlate more, irrespective of colour. Despite the clustering relationships with stellar mass, we find that the cross-power spectra are largely insensitive to detection limits in HI and galaxy surveys. Counter-intuitively, all auto and cross-power spectra for red and blue galaxies and HI decrease with time at all scales in IllustrisTNG. We demonstrate that processes associated with quenching contribute to this trend. The complex interplay between HI and galaxies underscores the importance of understanding baryonic effects when interpreting the large-scale clustering of HI, blue, and red galaxies at $z \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Detecting Detached Black Hole binaries through Photometric Variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help create this map since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH-LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH-LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history and present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia (TESS) is expected to resolve ~700-1500 (~100-400) detached BH-LC binaries depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. We find that ~369 BH-LC binaries would be common both in Gaia and TESS. Moreover, between ~80-270 (~70-290) of these BH-LC binaries can be further characterised using Gaia's radial velocity (astrometry) measurements.</description>

      <title>The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public Near-Infrared Slitless Survey Epoch 1 (NGDEEP-NISS1): Extra-Galactic Star-formation and Active Galactic Nuclei at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.6</title>

Abstract: The Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) survey program was designed specifically to include Near Infrared Slitless Spectroscopic observations (NGDEEP-NISS) to detect multiple emission lines in as many galaxies as possible and across a wide redshift range using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS). We present early results obtained from the the first set of observations (Epoch 1, 50$\%$ of the allocated orbits) of this program (NGDEEP-NISS1). Using a set of independently developed calibration files designed to deal with a complex combination of overlapping spectra, multiple position angles, and multiple cross filters and grisms, in conjunction with a robust and proven algorithm for quantifying contamination from overlapping dispersed spectra, NGDEEP-NISS1 has achieved a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity limit of 2 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$. We demonstrate the power of deep wide field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) to characterize the star-formation rates, and metallicity ([OIII]/H$\beta$), and dust content, of galaxies at $1&lt;z&lt;3.5$. The latter showing intriguing initial results on the applicability and assumptions made regarding the use of Case B recombination.
  Further, we identify the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and infer the mass of their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) using broadened restframe MgII and H$\beta$ emission lines. The spectroscopic results are then compared with the physical properties of galaxies extrapolated from fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to photometry alone. The results clearly demonstrate the unique power and efficiency of WFSS at near-infrared wavelengths over other methods to determine the properties of galaxies across a broad range of redshifts.</description>

      <title>Stellar Populations With Optical Spectra: Deep Learning vs. Popular Spectrum Fitting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the performance of several popular spectrum fitting codes (Firefly, starlight, pyPipe3D and pPXF), and a deep-learning convolutional neural network (StarNet), in recovering known stellar population properties (mean stellar age, stellar metallicity, stellar mass-to-light ratio M*/L_r and the internal E(B-V)) of simulated galaxy spectra in optical wavelengths. Our mock spectra are constructed from star-formation histories from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation. These spectra mimic the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) through a novel method of including the noise, sky residuals and emission lines taken directly from SDSS. We find that StarNet vastly outperforms all conventional codes in both speed and recovery of stellar population properties (error scatter &lt; 0.08 dex, average biases &lt; 0.02 dex for all tested quantities), but it requires an appropriate training set. Of the non-machine-learning codes, pPXF was a factor of 3-4 times faster than the other codes, and was the best in recovering stellar population properties (error scatter of &lt; 0.11 dex, average biases &lt; 0.08 dex). However, the errors and biases are strongly dependent on both true and predicted values of stellar age and metallicity, and signal-to-noise ratio. The biases of all codes can approach 0.15 dex in stellar ages, metallicities and log M*/L_r , but remain &lt; 0.05 for E(B-V). Using unrealistic Gaussian noise in the construction of mock spectra will underestimate the errors in the metallicities by a factor of two or more, and mocks without emission lines will underestimate the errors in stellar age and M*/L_r by a factor of two.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the collision scenario of the dissociative galaxy cluster Abell 56 through hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In galaxy cluster collisions, the gas can be separated from dark matter halos. Abell~56 displays signatures of a dissociative bullet-like merger with a possible high inclination angle between the plane of orbit and the sky. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive description of the features observed in the collision scenario of Abell~56. Additionally, we aim to apply a potential weak lensing mass bias correction attributed to the merger to evaluate its impact on our findings. To investigate this, we perform tailored hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations, varying the impact parameter. We initially identified an early scenario at $0.12$\,Gyr after the central passage that reproduces some observational features. However, the mean temperature of $9.7$\,keV exceeded the observed value. Our best model corresponds to the late scenario at $0.52$\,Gyr after the pericenter, reproducing observed features of Abell~56, with an inclination of $58^\circ$. These features include the offset of $103$\,kpc between the main gas density peak and the south dark matter density peak, gas morphology, a line of sight relative velocity of $184$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, and a mean temperature of $6.7$\,keV. This late model provides a plausible scenario to describe the dynamics of Abell~56. The weak lensing mass bias did not significantly impact the overall dynamics of this cluster merger.</description>

      <title>The MASSIVE survey -- XIX. Molecular gas measurements of the supermassive black hole masses in the elliptical galaxies NGC 1684 and NGC 0997</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses can be measured by observing their dynamical effects on tracers, such as molecular gas. We present high angular resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) line emission of the early-type galaxies (ETGs) NGC 1684 and NGC 0997, obtained as part of the MASSIVE survey, a volume-limited integral-field spectroscopic study of the most massive local ETGs. NGC 1684 has a regularly-rotating central molecular gas disc, with a spatial extent of $\approx 6 "$ ($\approx1.8$ kpc) in radius and a central hole slightly larger than the expected SMBH sphere of influence. We forward model the data cube in a Bayesian framework with the Kinematic Molecular Simulation (KinMS) code and infer a SMBH mass of $1.40^{+0.44}_{-0.39}\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ ($3\sigma$ confidence interval) and a F110W-filter stellar mass-to-light ratio of $(2.50\pm0.05)$ M$_\odot/\text{L}_{\odot,\text{F110W}}$. NGC 0997 has a regularly-rotating central molecular gas disc, with a spatial extent of $\approx5 "$ ($\approx2.2$ kpc) in radius and a partially-filled central hole much larger than the expected SMBH sphere of influence, thus preventing a robust SMBH mass determination. With the same modelling method, we nevertheless constrain the SMBH mass to be in the range $4.0\times10^7$ to $1.8\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ and the F160W-filter stellar mass-to-light ratio to be $(1.52\pm0.11)$ M$_\odot/\text{L}_{\odot,\text{F160W}}$. Both SMBH masses are consistent with the SMBH mass -- stellar velocity dispersion ($M_{\text{BH}}$ -- $\sigma_\text{e}$) relation, suggesting that the over-massive SMBHs present in other very massive ETGs are fairly uncommon.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Starbursts: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission at the Base of the M 82 Galactic Wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new observations of the central 1 kpc of the M 82 starburst obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near-infrared camera (NIRCam) instrument at a resolution ~0.05"-0.1" (~1-2 pc). The data comprises images in three mostly continuum filters (F140M, F250M, and F360M), and filters that contain [FeII] (F164N), H2 v=1-0 (F212N), and the 3.3 um PAH feature (F335M). We find prominent plumes of PAH emission extending outward from the central starburst region, together with a network of complex filamentary substructure and edge-brightened bubble-like features. The structure of the PAH emission closely resembles that of the ionized gas, as revealed in Paschen alpha and free-free radio emission. We discuss the origin of the structure, and suggest the PAHs are embedded in a combination of neutral, molecular, and photoionized gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-term relaxation of rotating, spherically symmetric globular clusters is investigated through an extension of the orbit averaged Chandrasekhar non-resonant formalism. A comparison is made with the long-term evolution of the distribution function in action space, measured from averages of sets of $N$-body simulations up to core collapse. The impact of rotation on in-plane relaxation is found to be weak. In addition, we observe a clear match between theoretical predictions and $N$-body measurements. For the class of rotating models considered, we find no strong gravo-gyro catastrophe accelerating core collapse. Both kinetic theory and simulations predict a reshuffling of orbital inclinations from overpopulated regions to underpopulated ones. This trend accelerates as the amount of rotation is increased. Yet, for orbits closer to the rotational plane, the non-resonant prediction does not reproduce numerical measurements. We argue that this mismatch stems from these orbits' coherent interactions, which are not captured by the non-resonant formalism that only addresses local deflections.</description>

      <title>Overmassive black holes at cosmic noon: linking the local and the high-redshift Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report for the first time a sample of 12 supermassive black holes (SMBHs) hosted by low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon, i.e., in a redshift range consistent with the peak of star formation history: $z \sim 1-3$. These black holes are two orders of magnitude too massive for the stellar content of their hosts when compared with the local relation for active galaxies. These overmassive systems at cosmic noon share similar properties with the high-$z$ sources found ubiquitously in recent \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (\textit{JWST}) surveys (same range of black hole-to-stellar mass ratio, bolometric luminosity, and Eddington ratio). We argue that black hole feedback processes, for which there is possible evidence in five of the sources, and the differing environments in galactic nuclei at these respective epochs play a key role in these overmassive systems. These findings contribute to our understanding of the growth and co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies across cosmic time, offering a link between the early Universe ($z &gt; 4$) observed by \textit{JWST} and observations of the present-day Universe ($z \lesssim 1$).</description>

      <title>AstroSat observations of interacting galaxies NGC 7469 and IC 5283</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out deep near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging of an interacting galaxy system, comprised of a Seyfert type 1 galaxy NGC 7469 and its companion IC 5283. Our aim is to resolve and map the star-forming regions in the outer arms and look for signs of interaction between the two galaxies. We used AstroSat Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) to obtain NUV and FUV images of NGC 7469 in a range of filters. We have carried out photometry of star-forming regions in the two galaxies and found their spatial distributions. We also obtained the distributions of star formation rates (SFR) in NGC 7469 and IC 5283 using the estimates obtained from the FUV and NUV bands. We also carried out Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to look for differences in the SFRs in the two galaxies. We derived the spectral energy distribution (SED), leading to the determination of physical parameters, including the overall SFR, stellar mass ($\text{M}_{*}$), dust mass ($\text{M}_\text{Dust}$), and specific star formation rates (sSFRs) in both the galaxies. Our NUV and FUV images show the presence of an outer spiral arm that is better resolved. We have identified 33 new star-forming regions out of 51 total identified in the UVIT composite image. Enhanced star formation activity is observed to coincide with the interaction, and KS tests show that there are no significant differences in the SFR distributions of NGC 7469 and IC 5283, indicating that the interaction between the galaxies has not influenced their star formation processes differently. The SED plots and the photometric results demonstrate that most of the star formation activity is confined inside the central starburst (SB) ring.</description>

      <title>Impact of astrophysical effects on the dark matter mass constraint with 21cm intensity mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an innovative approach to constraining the non-cold dark matter model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with varying dark matter particle masses and generate mock 21cm radio intensity maps to trace the dark matter distribution. Our proposed method complements the traditional power spectrum analysis. We compare our CNN classification results with those from the power spectrum of the differential brightness temperature map of 21cm radiation, and find that the CNN outperforms the latter. Moreover, we investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the dark matter model constraint, including star formation, self-shielding of HI gas, and UV background model. We find that these effects may introduce some contamination in the dark matter constraint, but they are insignificant when compared to the realistic system noise of the SKA instruments.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mass Segregation of the Binary Stars in the Open Cluster NGC 6819</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for mass segregation in the intermediate-aged open cluster NGC 6819 within a carefully identified sample of probable cluster members. Using photometry from the Gaia, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS surveys as inputs for a Bayesian statistics software suite, BASE-9, we identify a rich population of (photometric) binaries and derive posterior distributions for the cluster age, distance, metallicity and reddening as well as star-by-star photometric membership probabilities, masses and mass ratios (for binaries). Within our entire sample, we find 2632 cluster members and 777 binaries. We then select a main-sequence 'primary sample' with 14.85 &lt; G &lt; 19.5 containing 1342 cluster members and 250 binaries with mass ratios q &gt; 0.5, to investigate for mass segregation. Within this primary sample, we find the binary radial distribution is significantly shifted toward the cluster center as compared to the single stars, resulting in a binary fraction that increases significantly toward the cluster core. Furthermore, we find that within the binary sample, more massive binaries have more centrally concentrated radial distributions than less massive binaries. The same is true for the single stars. We verify the expectation of mass segregation for this stellar sample in NGC 6819 through both relaxation time arguments and by investigating a sophisticated N-body model of the cluster. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate mass segregation of the binaries in the open cluster NGC 6819.</description>

      <title>Simulating the epoch of Helium Reionization in photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reionization of the second electron of helium (HeII) leaves important imprints on the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Observational evidence suggests that HeII reionization ended at $z \simeq 3$ due to ionizing photons emitted predominantly by quasars. We present efficient semi-numerical simulations of helium reionization in a $230 \ \mathrm{h^{-1}~Mpc}$ box, that takes into account the spatial patchiness of reionization coupled with photoheating of the IGM. Dark matter haloes are assigned quasars using empirical measurements of the quasar luminosity function, assuming a universal quasar lifetime consistent with duty cycle values inferred from measurements of the quasar clustering. The ionizing photon field from quasars is then included in the semi-numerical Code for ReionIzation with PhoTon conservation (SCRIPT), which was originally developed for modeling hydrogen reionization. In this work, we make appropriate modifications to SCRIPT for modeling inhomogenous HeII reionization and the corresponding thermal history of the IGM is modelled via a subgrid prescription. Our model has three main free parameters i.e. the global clumping factor $\mathcal{C}_{HeIII}$, the temperature increase due to photoheating $T^{re}_{He}$ and the quasar spectral energy distribution (SED) index, $\alpha_{UV}$. Our fiducial model with $\mathcal{C}_{HeIII}=15.6$ and $T^{re}_{He} \sim 6000 \ K$ gives reasonable values for the empirical measurements of the temperature density equation of state at these redshifts, assuming that quasars brighter than $\mathrm{M_{1450}}&lt;-21$ and having $\alpha_{UV}=1.7$ contribute to HeII reionization. The efficiency of our code shows promising prospects for performing parameter estimation in future, for models of HeII reionization using observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest.</description>

      <title>PEARLS: NuSTAR and XMM-Newton Extragalactic Survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the second NuSTAR and XMM-Newton extragalactic survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time-Domain Field (TDF). The first NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey (Zhao et al. 2021) had 681 ks total exposure time executed in NuSTAR cycle 5, in 2019 and 2020. This second survey, acquired from 2020 to 2022 in cycle 6, adds 880 ks of NuSTAR exposure time. The overall NuSTAR NEP-TDF survey is the most sensitive NuSTAR extragalactic survey to date, and a total of 60 sources were detected above the 95% reliability threshold. We constrain the hard X-ray number counts, logN-log S, down to 1.7 x 10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 8-24 keV and detect an excess of hard X-ray sources at the faint end. About 47% of the NuSTAR-detected sources are heavily obscured (NH &gt; 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), and 18+20% of the NuSTAR-detected sources are Compton-thick (N&gt;10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). These fractions are consistent with those measured in other NuSTAR surveys. Four sources presented &gt;2$\sigma$ variability in the 3-year survey. In addition to NuSTAR, a total of 62 ks of XMM-Newton observations were taken during NuSTAR cycle 6. The XMM-Newton observations provide soft X-ray (0.5-10keV) coverage in the same field and enable more robust identification of the visible and infrared counterparts of the NuSTAR-detected sources. A total of 286 soft X-ray sources were detected, out of which 214 XMM-Newton sources have secure counterparts from multiwavelength catalogs.</description>

Abstract: Observations of caustic-crossing galaxies at redshift $0.7&lt;z&lt;1$ show a wealth of transient events. Most of them are believed to be microlensing events of highly magnified stars. Earlier work predicted such events should be common near the critical curves (CCs) of galaxy clusters, but some are found relatively far away from these CCs. We consider the possibility that substructure on milliarcsecond scales (few parsecs in the lens plane) is boosting the microlensing signal. We study the combined magnification from the macrolens, millilenses, and microlenses (3M-lensing). After considering realistic populations of millilenses and microlenses, we conclude that the enhanced microlensing rate around millilenses is not sufficient to explain the high fraction of observed events in the far region. Instead we find a that the shape of the luminosity function (LF) of the lensed stars combined with the amount of substructure in the lens plane determines the number of mcirolensing events found near and far from the CC. By measuring $\beta$ (the exponent of the LF), and the number density of microlensing events at each location, one can create a pseudoimage of the underlying distribution of mass on small scales. We identify two regimes: (i) positive imaging regime where $\beta&gt;2$ and the number density of events is greater around substructureand the number density of events is greater around substructures, and (ii) negative imaging regime where $\beta&lt;2$. We study the particular case of seven microlensing events found by HST in the Dragon arc (at z=0.725). We find that a population of supergiant stars with a steep LF with $\beta=2.55$ fits the distribution of these events. We identify a small region of high density of microlensing events, and interpret it as evidence of a possible invisible substructure, for which we derive a mass of $\sim 1.3 \times 10^8\,\Msun$ (within its Einstein radius).</description>
