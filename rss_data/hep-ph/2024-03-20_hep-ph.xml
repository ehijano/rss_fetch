      <title>Holographic Energy Correlators for Confining Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a holographic calculation of energy correlators in a simple model of confinement based on a warped extra dimension with an IR brane. For small distances we reproduce the constant correlators of a strongly-coupled conformal field theory, while for large distances the effects of confinement dominate and the correlators decay exponentially. We find exact shockwave solutions to the Einstein equations in the presence of the IR brane, hence avoiding the need for a perturbative expansion in terms of Witten diagrams. While some of the expected qualitative features of energy correlators in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are reproduced, our crude model of confinement does not capture the effects of asymptotic freedom nor exhibit jetty behavior. We expect that our method can also be applied to more realistic models of confinement incorporating asymptotic freedom, which should fix some of the deviations from QCD.</description>

      <title>ALP contribution to the Strong CP problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop contribution to the $\bar{\theta}$-parameter of an axion-like particle (ALP) with CP-odd derivative couplings. Its contribution to the neutron electric dipole moment is shown to be orders of magnitude larger than that stemming from the one-loop ALP contributions to the up- and down-quark electric and chromoelectric dipole moments. This strongly improves existing bounds on ALP-fermion CP-odd interactions, and also sets limits on previously unconstrained couplings. The case of a general singlet scalar is analyzed as well. In addition, we explore how the bounds are modified in the presence of a Peccei-Quinn symmetry.</description>

      <title>An Imperative study of the angular observables in $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^{+}(\to \Lambda \pi^{+})\tau \bar{\nu_{\tau}}$ decay and probing the footprint of new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 4-body angular distribution for $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^{+}(\to \Lambda \pi^{+})\ell^- \bar{\nu}$ decays and find out the analytical expressions for various asymmetric and angular observables in the Standard Model and the new physics scenarios and compared them with the literature. Using the available inputs from the lattice, we have predicted the values with uncertainties of all these observables in the Standard Model. Considering the new physics effects in $b\to c\tau^-\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ transitions, we have constrained the new Wilson coefficients of the one operator and two operator scenarios from the available data on these decays. The two-operator scenario with scalar-pseudoscalar and tensor quark current provides the most plausible solution to the current data. Also, we have tested the new physics sensitivities (one or two-operator scenarios) of the different angular observables in $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c (\to \Lambda \pi^{+}) \tau^- \bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decays and found correlations among them. We have noted a few one or two-operator scenarios to which some of these observables are sensitive. By measuring these observables, it will be possible to distinguish these effects from one another.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Induced Supernovae Cooling: New Contribution from Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact stellar objects like supernovae and neutron stars are believed to cool by emitting axions predominantly via axion bremsstrahlung ($NN \to NNa$), pion conversion ($\pi^- p^+ \to N a$) and photo-production ($\gamma N \to N a$). In this $\textit{letter}$, we study a previously overlooked contribution to the photo-production channel, originating from the $\textit{unavoidable}$ anomaly-induced Wess-Zumino-Witten term $\propto \epsilon^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}\, F_{\mu \nu}\, \partial_\alpha a \, \omega_\beta$. As a result, supernovae can cool up to three times faster than what was previously thought, translating into stronger bounds on the axion decay constant. Furthermore, the spectrum of axions emitted in the process is $\textit unique$ as it is significantly harder than those originating from bremsstrahlung. As a consequence, we find that these axions are more likely to show up in near future water Cherenkov detectors as compared to traditional ones.</description>

      <title>Atomic binding corrections for high energy fixed target experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High energy beams incident on a fixed target may scatter against atomic electrons. To a first approximation, one can treat these electrons as at rest. For precision experiments, however, it is important to be able to estimate the size of, and when necessary calculate, sub-leading corrections. We discuss atomic binding corrections to relativistic lepton-electron scattering. We analyze hydrogen in detail, before generalizing our analysis to multi-electron atoms. Using the virial theorem, and many-body sum rules, we find that the corrections can be reduced to measured binding energies, and the expectation value of a single one-body operator. We comment on the phenomenological impact for neutrino flux normalization and an extraction of hadronic vacuum polarization from elastic muon electron scattering at MUonE.</description>

      <title>Fast flavor conversions at the edge of instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dense neutrino gas exhibiting angular crossings in the electron lepton number is unstable and develops fast flavor conversions. Instead of assuming an unstable configuration from the onset, we imagine that the system is externally driven toward instability. We use the simplest model of two neutrino beams initially of different flavor that either suddenly appear or one or both slowly build up. Flavor conversions commence well before the putative unstable state is fully attained, and the final outcome depends on how the system is driven. Our results suggest that in an astrophysical setting, one should focus less on flavor instabilities in the neutrino radiation field and more on the external dynamics that leads to the formation of the unstable state.</description>

      <title>QCD effects in electroweak $WZjj$ production at current and future hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new features for the implementation of $WZjj$ production via vector-boson scattering in the framework of the POWHEG BOX program. In particular, previously unavailable semi-leptonic and fully hadronic decay modes of the intermediate vector bosons are provided, and operators of dimension six in an effective-field theory approach to account for physics beyond the Standard Model in the electroweak sector are included. For selected applications phenomenological results are provided to illustrate the capabilities of the new program. The impact of the considered dimension-six operators on experimentally accessible distributions is found to be small for current LHC energies, but enhanced in the kinematic reach of a potential future hadron collider with an energy of 100 TeV. The relevance of fully accounting for spin correlations and off-shell effects in the decay system is explored by a comparison with results obtained with the MadSpin tool that are based on an approximate treatment of the leptonic final state resulting from vector boson scattering processes. For selected semi-leptonic and hadronic decay modes we demonstrate the sensitivity of realistic signal selection procedures on QCD corrections and parton-shower effects.</description>

      <title>The Amaterasu Cosmic Ray as a Magnetic Monopole and Implications for Extensions of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Amaterasu cosmic ray particle appears to have come from the direction of the local cosmic void. We take this as evidence that it is a magnetic monopole rather than a proton or nucleus. This in turn strongly suggests physics at high energy is described by a quiver gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Dirac Nature of Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid the uncertainty regarding the fundamental nature of neutrinos, we adhere to the Dirac one, and construct a model in the light of $\Delta(27)$ symmetry. The model is enriched by an additional $Z_{10}$ symmetry, to eliminate the possibility of the Majorana mass terms. The neutrino mass matrix exhibits four texture zeroes, and the associated mixing scheme aligns with the experimental data, notably controlled by a single parameter. In addition, the model emphasizes on the \emph{standard parametrization} of the lepton mixing matrix, which is crucial in the light of model building and neutrino physics experiments</description>

      <title>Scalar dark matter explanation of the excess in the Belle II $B^+\to K^+ + \mbox{invisible}$ measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Belle II reported the first measurement of $B^+\to K^++\mbox{invisible (inv)}$, which is $2.7\sigma$ above the standard model (SM) prediction. If confirmed, this calls for new physics beyond SM. In the SM, the invisible particles are neutrino-anti-neutrino pairs. There are more possibilities when going beyond the SM. In this work, we focus on decays to dark matter (DM) and show that the $B\to K +\mathrm{inv}$ excess from Belle II and DM relic density can be simultaneously explained in a simple extension of the SM. The model introduces a real scalar singlet $\phi$ acting as a DM candidate, and two heavy vector-like quarks $Q,D$ with the same quantum numbers as the SM left-handed quark doublet and right-handed down-type quark singlet, respectively. All these new particles are odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry while the SM particles are even. The model can successfully explain the Belle II anomaly and DM relic density for TeV-scale heavy quarks with hierarchical Yukawa couplings involving $b$ and $s$ quarks. At the same time, it can easily satisfy other flavour physics and DM detection constraints.</description>

      <title>Polarization Dynamics in Paramagnet of Charged Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly understood that the strong magnetic field produced in heavy ion collisions is short-lived. The electric conductivity of the quark-gluon plasma is unable to significantly extend the life time of magnetic field. We propose an alternative scenario to achieve this: with finite baryon density and spin polarization by the initial magnetic field, the quark-gluon plasma behaves as a paramagnet, which may continue to polarize quark after fading of initial magnetic field. We confirm this picture by calculations in both quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics. In the former case, we find a splitting in the damping rates of probe fermion with opposite spin component along the magnetic field with the splitting parametrically small than the average damping rate. In the latter case, we find a similar splitting in the damping rates of probe quark with opposite spin components along the magnetic field. The splitting is parametrically comparable to the average damping rate, providing an efficient way of polarizing strange quarks by the quark-gluon plasma paramagnet consisting of light quarks.</description>

      <title>All-order Feynman rule for leading-twist quark operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an expression for the Feynman rule for leading-twist quark operators with an arbitrary number of total derivatives and an arbitrary number of gluons. This provides a generalization of known results and constitutes a necessary ingredient in the computation of the matrix elements of the corresponding operators. The result is in a form appropriate for implementation in a computer algebra system. To illustrate the latter we provide implementations in Mathematica and FORM, which are made available at https://github.com/vtsam/NKLO.</description>

      <title>The structure of the f_0(980) from system size dependent hadronic resonance ratios in p+p, p+Pb, and Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the hadronic phase in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions can be used to understand the properties of the $f_0(980)$ resonance. In particular it is shown that the centrality dependence of the $f_0(980)/\pi$ and $f_0(980)/\phi$ ratios depends strongly on the $f_0(980)\rightarrow \overline{K}+K$ branching ratio and whether the $f_0(980)$ is produced as a $\left | \overline{q}q \right \rangle$ or $\left | \overline{s}s \right \rangle$ state. These conclusions are drawn from calculations within the partial chemical equilibrium of the HRG model within Thermal-FIST as well as with the fully non-equilibrium hybrid-transport approach UrQMD. Our findings show how the hadronic phase in heavy ion collisions can be used for studies of exotic hadron properties otherwise possible only in dedicated experiments such as PANDA.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of near-threshold $s$-wave resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-threshold clustering phenomenon is well understood by the low-energy universality, for shallow bound states below the threshold. Nevertheless, the characteristics of resonances slightly above the threshold still lack thorough elucidation. We introduce a novel probabilistic interpretation scheme for complex compositeness of resonances, in which the resonances with unphysically large decay widths are inherently excluded. Employing this scheme to analyze resonances via the effective range expansion, we demonstrate that near-threshold resonances have small composite fraction, in sharp contrast to shallow bound states below the threshold.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of heavy hybrid quarkonia and $\overline{b}gc$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masses and current couplings of the charmonium and bottomonium hybrids $ \overline{c}gc$ and $\overline{b}gb$ with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=0^{++},\ 0^{+-},\ 0^{-+},\ 0^{--}$ and $1^{++},\ 1^{+-},\ 1^{-+},\ 1^{--}$ are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. Computations are performed by taking into account gluon condensates up to dimension 12 including terms $\sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2}$. The parameters of the bottom-charm hybrids $\overline{b}gc$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC }}=0^{+},\ 0^{-},\ 1^{+}$, and $1^{-}$ are calculated as well. In computations the dominance of the pole contribution to sum rule results is ensured. It is demonstrated that all charmonia hybrids decay strongly to two-meson final states. The bottomonium hybrids $0^{-+}$ and $1^{-+}$ as well as the bottom-charm hybrids $0^{-(+)}$ and $1^{-(+)}$ may be stable against strong two-meson decay modes. Results of the present work are compared with ones obtained using the sum rule and alternative approaches. Our predictions for parameters of the heavy hybrid mesons may be useful to study their various decay channels which are important for interpretation of ongoing and future experiments.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ production within a jet in high-energy proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of leading power factorization formalism of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics, we calculate the jet fragmentation function for $J/\psi$ production in proton-proton (pp) collisions ranging from $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV to $13$ TeV. The reasonable agreements between theory and experimental data indicate that $J/\psi$ production within a jet is mainly dominated by gluon fragmentation. Such a mechanism can be further tested by the predicted jet transverse momentum and radius dependence of jet fragmentation function. Based on the satisfying description of pp baseline, we carry out the first theoretical investigation on medium modification on $J/\psi$ production within jet in heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, using a linear Boltzmann transport model combined with hydrodynamics for the simulation of jet-medium interaction. The consistency with the experimental measurement on nuclear modification factor $R_{\text{AA}}$ by CMS collaboration reveals that the gluon jet quenching is the driving force for the suppression of $J/\psi$ production in jet. Furthermore, we make predictions for the dependence of $R_{\text{AA}}$ on the jet transverse momentum and jet radius $R$, which can be tested in future measurements to further constrain the flavor dependence of jet quenching.</description>

      <title>Extraction of trans-helicity worm-gear distributions and opportunities at the Electron-Ion Collider in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a global analysis of the trans-helicity worm-gear distribution function, $g_{1T}^\perp$, by fitting the longitudinal-transverse double spin asymmetry data of the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. The analysis is performed within the framework of transverse momentum dependent factorization and evolution. It is found that the $u$-quark favors a positive distribution and the $d$-quark favors a negative distribution, which is consistent with previous model calculations and phenomenological extractions. Based on the fit to existing world data, we also study the impact of the proposed electron-ion collider in China and conclude that it can significantly improve the precision of the worm-gear distribution function and hence enhance our understanding of nucleon spin structures.</description>

Abstract: These proceedings provide a brief overview of the status of $B$ meson physics, putting particular emphasis on precision tests of the Standard Model with meson mixing data, and on the anomalies in charged- and neutral-current semileptonic $B$ decays. In addition to summarising the current status, some promising directions to be pursued at future collider experiments are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Model-independent predictions for decays of double-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-heavy hadrons can decay into pairs of heavy hadrons through transitions from confining Born-Oppenheimer potentials to hadron-pair potentials with the same Born-Oppenheimer quantum numbers. The transitions are also constrained by conservation of angular momentum and parity. From these constraints, we derive model-independent selection rules for decays of double-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons. The coupling potentials are expressed as sums of products of Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitudes and angular-momentum coefficients. If there is a single dominant Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitude, it factors out of the coupling potentials between double-heavy hadrons in the same Born-Oppenheimer multiplet and pairs of heavy hadrons in specific heavy-quark-spin-symmetry doublets. If furthermore the kinetic energies of the heavy hadrons are much larger than their spin splittings, we obtain analytic expressions for the relative partial decay rates in terms of Wigner 6-j and 9-j symbols. We consider in detail the decays of quarkonia and quarkonium hybrids into the lightest heavy-meson pairs. For quarkonia, our model-independent selection rules and relative partial decay rates agree with previous results from quark-pair-creation models in simple cases and give stronger results in other cases. For quarkonium hybrids, we find disagreement even in simple cases.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constraints on large multiplets of arbitrary gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We impose partial-wave unitarity on $2 \to 2$ tree-level scattering processes to derive constraints on the dimensions of large scalar and fermionic multiplets of arbitrary gauge groups. We apply our results to scalar and fermionic extensions of the Standard Model, and also to the Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) based on the groups $SU(5)$, $SO(10)$, and $E_6$. We find scenarios within the latter two GUTs that violate the unitarity condition; this may require a reevaluation of the validity of perturbation theory in those scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms ofthe cutoff. We show that already at order 4-d where d is the dimension of the phi^{4} theory there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor phi^{4} model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed by the different flavors having different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG).</description>

      <title>Soft Scalars in Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a soft theorem for a massless scalar in an effective field theory with generic field content using the geometry of field space. This result extends the geometric soft theorem for scalar effective field theories by allowing the massless scalar to couple to other scalars, fermions, and gauge bosons. The soft theorem keeps its geometric form, but where the field-space geometry now involves the full field content of the theory. As a bonus, we also present novel double soft theorems with fermions, which mimic the geometric structure of the double soft theorem for scalars.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Purity Lost: Perturbative and Resummed Late-Time Inflationary Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the rate with which unobserved fields decohere other fields to which they couple, both in flat space and in de Sitter space, for scalar fields prepared in their standard adiabatic vacuum. The process is very efficient in de Sitter space once the modes in question pass outside the Hubble scale, displaying the tell-tale phenomenon of secular growth that indicates the breakdown of perturbative methods on a time scale parameterically long compared with the Hubble time. We show how to match the perturbative evolution valid at early times onto a late-time Lindblad evolution whose domain of validity extends to much later times, thereby allowing a reliable resummation of the perturbative result beyond the perturbative regime. Super-Hubble modes turn out to be dominantly decohered by unobserved modes that are themselves also super-Hubble. When applied to curvature perturbations during inflation this observation closes a potential loophole in recent calculations of the late-time purity of the observable primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the photon mass via the Shapiro effect in the solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of a finite mass for the photon on its propagation in a weak gravitational field. In particular, we analyse the gravitational time delay, also known as the Shapiro effect. We work in isotropic coordinates in the weak-field limit and find that the mass-dependent corrections enhance the gravitational time delay. Doppler-tracking data from the Cassini mission allow us to set upper bounds on the photon mass at the level of $m_\gamma \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-7} \, {\rm eV/c^2}$. We also discuss next-generation solar-system tests of general relativity that could improve this upper limit, potentially reaching $m_\gamma \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-8} \, {\rm eV/c^2}$. Though not competitive with the currently best limits, our projected bounds are at the ballpark of earlier ones based on the gravitational deflection angle.</description>

      <title>Effective Metric Descriptions of Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work [arXiv:2307.13489 [gr-qc]], we have described spherically symmetric and static quantum black holes as deformations of the classical Schwarzschild metric that depend on the physical distance to the horizon. We have developed a framework that allows to compute the latter in a self-consistent fashion from the deformed geometry, in the vicinity of the horizon. However, in this formalism, the distance can be replaced by other physical quantities, e.g. curvature invariants such as the Ricci- or Kretschmann scalar. Here, we therefore define a more general framework, which we call an "effective metric description" (EMD), that captures the deformed geometry based on a generic physical quantity. We develop in detail the Ricci- and Kretschmann scalar EMD, in particular demonstrating how to compute the geometry in a self-consistent manner. Moreover, we provide explicit relations that allow to express one EMD in terms of the others, thus demonstrating their equivalence.</description>

      <title>The gauge symmetry - unbroken and broken - in the QCD ground state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this work is to report on convincing progress made in the investigation of the one of the long-standing conceptual problems in QCD, namely whether the gauge symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian and its ground state coincide or not? For this purpose, we use only the tensor algebra derivation rigorous rules in dealing with the corresponding skeleton loop integrals, contributing into the full gluon self-energy. It has been exactly (i.e., without making any kind of the simplifications) proven that in the QCD ground state may exist the two principally different types of the gluon field configurations. One of them maintains the QCD Lagrangian's gauge symmetry, but another one does not.The dynamical source of this effect has to be identified with the constant tadpole term, having the dimension of a mass squared. The exact proof has been given that it cannot be disregarded from the theory and its ground state by any means. The gauge symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian forbids such term, but the perturbative renormalizability of the theory will not be affected. This allows to present the new significant insights into the gauge and dynamical structures of the true QCD ground state, and sheds light on a mass squared dynamical generation in it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the parameter space for processes with fermionic flavor violation within the 2HDM type III, processes of Flavor Changing Neutral Currents are present at LO as dynamics beyond the Standard Model are included. We analyze the possible Yukawa couplings beyond the SM involving the quark top, as the experimental signatures would be a clear signal to conclude about the model. The processes we analyzed are same sign top pair production at the $pp$ collisions, and single top quark production in $e p$ collisions, through DIS. To examine the scenarios that could exhibit such exotic events, we perform a scan in the parameter space to determine the observation possibilities for FCNC. We show the results considering the model parameters, coming from modified Yukawa interactions, $\vert\tilde{\chi}_{ij}^{f}\vert$ of the order one. In addition we explore the order of magnitude of possible single top production via $\mu p$, at the proposed muon-proton collider. We found scattering values for these exotic processes of up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})~pb$.</description>

      <title>Production locality and spatial diffusion of heavy flavour at high energy densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy-ion collisions are a unique tool for testing the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions. The momentum correlations of charm and bottom hadrons have been considered for testing heavy quarks' thermalization in the hot, dense medium produced by the collisions. In this respect, two effects have been considered: the decrease of the initial back-to-back correlations and the increase of correlations due to heavy-quark interactions with collectively flowing medium.
  Here, we show that, in the case of a single charm and anti-charm hadron pair production, the collective flow allows for testing heavy-quark production locality and spatial diffusion. Using an example of central Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS energies, we demonstrate that the azimuthal correlations of charm and anti-charm hadrons are particularly sensitive to their spatial correlations. We argue that the existing experimental technology and beam intensities at the CERN SPS should allow for the corresponding measurements soon. The correlation measurements in collisions with a single heavy-quark pair produced will provide a unique input constraining the diffusion of charm quarks and verifying assumptions concerning production locality of a charm and anti-charm quark pair.</description>

      <title>Twin Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the dark matter of our Universe could be sterile neutrinos which reside within the twin sector of a mirror twin Higgs model. In our scenario, these particles are produced through a version of the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism that takes place entirely within the twin sector, yielding a dark matter candidate that is consistent with X-ray and gamma-ray line constraints. Furthermore, this scenario can naturally avoid the cosmological problems that are typically encountered in mirror twin Higgs models. In particular, if the sterile neutrinos in the Standard Model sector decay out of equilibrium, they can heat the Standard Model bath and reduce the contributions of the twin particles to $N_\mathrm{eff}$. Such decays also reduce the effective temperature of the dark matter, thereby relaxing constraints from large-scale structure. The sterile neutrinos included in this model are compatible with the seesaw mechanism for generating Standard Model neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and Linear Holographic Hard Wall Models for Glueballs and the Pomeron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose improved holographic hard wall (HW) models by the inclusion of anomalous dimensions in the dual operators that describe glueballs inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence. The anomalous dimensions come from well known semi-classical gauge/string duality analysis showing a dependence with the logarithm of spin $S$ of the boundary states. We show that these logarithm anomalous dimensions of the high spin operators combined with the usual HW model allow us to match the pomeron trajectory and give glueball masses which are better than that of the original HW and soft wall (SW) models in comparison with lattice data. We also build up other anomalous HW (AHW) models considering that the logarithm anomalous dimensions can be approximated by a truncated series of odd powers of the difference $\sqrt{S}-1/\sqrt{S}$. These models also fit the pomeron trajectory and produce good glueball masses. Then, we consider an anomalous dimension which is proportional to $\sqrt{S}$, providing reasonable results. Finally, we propose an asymptotic linear AHW model which effective dimensions for high spins operators are of the form $\Delta=a\sqrt{S}+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants to be fixed by comparison with the soft pomeron trajectory. In this last model, the Regge trajectory is asymptotically linear even for very high spins ($J\sim 100$) matching the soft pomeron trajectory accurately and generates glueball masses with deviations with respect to the lattice data better than the original HW and SW models.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections to the Golden decay channel of the Higgs boson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future colliders aim to provide highly precise experimental measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson. In order to benefit from these precision machines, theoretical errors in the Higgs sector observables have to match at least the experimental uncertainties. The theoretical uncertainties in the Higgs sector observables can be reduced by including missing higher-order terms in their perturbative calculations. In this direction, we compute the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections at ${\mathcal O}(\alpha \alpha_s)$ to the Higgs decay into four charged leptons by considering the golden decay channel, $ H \to e^+e^-\mu^+\mu^-$. Due to color conservation, these corrections receive contributions only from the two-loop virtual diagrams. In the complex mass scheme, we find that the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections to the partial decay width, relative to the leading order predictions, are positive and about $0.27\%$ for $\alpha_s(M_Z)$. Relative to the next-to-leading order electroweak corrections, the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections are found to be approximately $18\%$ for $\alpha_s(M_Z)$. With respect to the leading order, we observe a flat effect of the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections on the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pairs with fixed QCD coupling. The $\phi$ distribution, due to the mixed QCD-electroweak corrections, follows a $(1-\cos \phi)$ dependence.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Neutrino Flavor Models and the Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Funnel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrinoless double beta decay experimental effort continues to make tremendous progress with hopes of covering the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy in coming years and pushing from the quasi-degenerate hierarchy into the normal hierarchy. As neutrino oscillation data is starting to suggest that the mass ordering may be normal, we may well be faced with staring down the funnel of death: a region of parameter space in the normal ordering where -- for a particular cancellation among the absolute neutrino mass scale, the Majorana phases, and the oscillation parameters -- the neutrinoless double beta decay rate may be vanishingly small. To answer the question of whether this region of parameter space is theoretically preferred, we survey five broad categories of flavor model structures which make various different predictions for parameters relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay to determine how likely it is that the rate may be in this funnel region. We find that a non-negligible fraction of predictions surveyed are at least partially in the funnel region. Our results can guide model builders and experimentalists alike in focusing their efforts on theoretically motivated regions of parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We study the effect of dark matter annihilation on the formation of Jovian planets. We show that dark matter heat injections can slow or halt Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, preventing the accretion of hydrogen and helium onto the solid core. The existence of Jupiter in our solar system can therefore be used to infer constraints on dark matter with relatively strong interaction cross sections. In the case of spin-dependent dark matter, we derive novel constraints beyond the reach of current direct detection experiments. We highlight the possibility of a positive detection using future observations by JWST, which could reveal strongly varying planet morpholoiges close to our Galactic Center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider gravitational production of singlet fermions such as sterile neutrinos during and after inflation. The production efficiency due to classical gravity is suppressed by the fermion mass. Quantum gravitational effects, on the other hand, are expected to break conformal invariance of the fermion sector by the Planck scale-suppressed operators irrespective of the mass. We find that such operators are very efficient in fermion production immediately after inflation, generating a significant background of stable or long-lived feebly interacting particles. This applies, in particular, to sterile neutrinos which can constitute cold non-thermal dark matter for a wide range of masses, including the keV scale.</description>

In the search for dark matter candidates, the QCD axion and axionlike particles (ALPs) have emerged as prominent possibilities. These elusive particles can aggregate into dense structures called axion stars through Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Such axion stars could constitute a significant portion of the mysterious dark matter in the universe. When these axion stars grow beyond a critical mass, usually through processes like accretion or merging, they undergo a self-driven collapse. Traditionally, for spherically symmetric axion clumps, the interaction between axions and photons does not lead to parametric resonance, especially when the QCD axion-photon coupling is at standard levels. Nevertheless, our study indicates that even QCD axion stars with typical coupling values can trigger stimulated decay during their collapse, rather than producing relativistic axions through self-interactions. This process results in short radio bursts, with durations of around 0.1 seconds, and can be potentially observed using radio telescopes like FAST or SKA. Furthermore, we find that collapsing axion stars for ALPs with specific parameters may emit radio bursts lasting just milliseconds with a peak luminosity of $1.60\times10^{42}\rm{erg/s}$, matching the characteristics of the observed non-repeating FRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that contrary to claims of Ref. [1] the formulated in the proper physical variables Low theorem [2] for soft photon emission does not require any modification. We also reject the criticism in Ref. [1] of the papers [3,4]. At the same time, we identify some inaccuracies in Ref. [3] in the presentation of the soft-photon theorem for the case of spin-one-half particles. We also point out shortcomings in consideration of the Low theorem in the classic textbooks [5,6].</description>

      <title>A Panoramic Study of $K$-Factors for 111 Processes at the 14 TeV LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this comprehensive study, we investigate $K$-factors ($K=\sigma_{\text{NLO}}/\sigma_{\text{LO}}\equiv 1+\delta K$) for a broad array of Standard Model processes at the 14 TeV LHC, which are pivotal for background assessments in Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) searches. Using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, we calculate the leading-order and next-to-leading order (NLO) cross-sections and compute the corresponding $K$-factors for 111 processes. Our analysis reveals $K$-factors ranging from 1.005 for $pp \to jjj$ to 4.221 for $pp\to W^\pm \gamma\gamma\gamma$. Key findings include: (i) processes involving photons display significantly high $K$-factors, attributed to gluon-initiated processes at NLO; (ii) processes with multiple particle productions, particularly those involving vector bosons, exhibit elevated $K$-factors due to multiple real emission processes; (iii) there exists an inverse correlation between the number of jets and $\delta K$, indicating that the addition of jets generally leads to a decrease in $\delta K$. Additionally, our investigation into differential $K$-factors relative to transverse momentum and invariant mass shows notable increases with higher $p_T$, but minimal changes with invariant mass. This study highlights the indispensable role of precise $K$-factor evaluations for accurate interpretations of BSM search outcomes.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the convergence of expansions at finite baryon chemical potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convergence of three different expansion schemes at finite baryon chemical potentials, including the conventional Taylor expansion, the Pad\'e approximants, and the $T'$ expansion proposed recently in lattice QCD simulations, have been investigated in a low energy effective theory within the fRG approach. It is found that the $T'$ expansion or the Pad\'e approximants would hardly improve the convergence of expansion in comparison to the conventional Taylor expansion, within the expansion orders considered in this work. Furthermore, we find that the consistent regions of the three different expansions are in agreement with the convergence radius of the Lee-Yang edge singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the small-mass asymptotics of a class of massive $d$ dimensional angular integrals. These integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory calculations. We derive expressions characterizing their behavior in the vicinity of the massless limit for all cases with up to two denominators. The results established in this work are applicable to phase-space calculations where an integration over virtuality including the massless limit is required.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Monopole-Antimonopole Pair Production at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the urgent issues in high energy physics is the experimental confirmation of the electroweak monopole predicted by the standard model, and currently MoEDAL at LHC is actively searching for the monopole. However, the present LHC cannot produce the monopole if the mass is bigger than 7 TeV, while the monopole mass is expected to be around $M_W/\alpha \simeq 11~\text{TeV}$. In this paper we discuss how LHC could circumbent this energy constraint and produce the monopole even when the mass is bigger than 7 TeV, based on the following ideas. First, in the topological production of the monopole the baby monopole mass at creation could be considerably smaller than the adolescent mass. Second, the binding energy of the monopole-antimonopole pair could effectively reduce the mass of the bound state. We discuss how these ideas can actually be realized at LHC to produce the monopole pairs. In particular, we argue that LHC could produce the baby electroweak monopoles whose mass could be around 5.3 TeV, smaller than the adolescent monopole mass around 11.0 TeV. Moreover, we show that LHC could produce the monopolium bound state with mass around 2.5 TeV, even when the total mass of the monopole-antimonopole pair is around 10.6 TeV. Our analysis could play an important role for MoEDAL experiment.</description>

      <title>Canonical and Non-canonical Inflation in the light of the recent BICEP/Keck results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss implications of the latest BICEP/Keck data release for inflationary models, with particular emphasis on scalar fields with non-canonical Lagrangians of the type ${\cal L} = X^\alpha - V(\phi)$. The observational upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r \leq 0.036$, implies that the whole family of monomial power law potentials $V(\phi) \sim \phi^p$ are now ruled out in the canonical framework at $95\%$ confidence, which includes the simplest classic inflationary potentials such as $\frac{1}{2}m^2 \phi^2$ and $\lambda \phi^4$. Instead, current observations strongly favour asymptotically flat plateau potentials. However, working in the non-canonical framework, we demonstrate that monomial potentials, as well as the Higgs potential with its Standard Model self-coupling, can easily be accommodated by current CMB data. We find striking similarities between the $\lbrace n_{_S}, r\rbrace$ flow lines of monomial potentials in the non-canonical framework and the T-model $\alpha$-attractors in the canonical framework. Significantly, $V(\phi)$ can originate from Planck scale initial values $V(\phi) \simeq m_p^4$ in non-canonical models while in plateau-like canonical inflation the initial value of the potential is strongly suppressed $V_{\rm plat}(\phi) \leq 10^{-10} m_p^4$. This has bearing on the issue of initial conditions for inflation and allows for the equipartition of the kinetic and potential terms in non-canonical models.</description>

      <title>Decays of $1^{-+}$ Charmoniumlike Hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extracting the transition amplitudes, we give the first lattice QCD prediction of the two-body decay partial widths of the $1^{-+}$ charmoniumlike hybrid $\eta_{c1}$. Given the calculated mass value $m_{\eta_{c1}}=4.329(36)$ GeV, the $\eta_{c1}$ decay is dominated by the open charm modes $D_1\bar{D}$, $D^*\bar{D}$ and $D^*\bar{D}^*$ with partial widths of $258(133)$ MeV, $88(18)$ MeV and $150(118)$ MeV, respectively. The coupling of $\eta_{c1}$ to $\chi_{c1}$ plus a flavor singlet pseudoscalar is not small, but $\chi_{c1}\eta$ decay is suppressed by the small $\eta-\eta'$ mixing angle. The partial width of $\eta_{c1}\to \eta_c\eta'$ is estimated to be around 1 MeV. We suggest experiments to search for $\eta_{c1}$ in the $P$-wave $D^*\bar{D}$ and $D^*\bar{D}^*$ systems. Especially, the polarization of $D^*\bar{D}^*$ can be used to distinguish the $1^{-+}$ product (total spin $S=1$) from $1^{--}$ products ($S=0$).</description>

      <title>Testing Parity Symmetry with the Polarized Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New physics in the early Universe could lead to parity-violation in the late Universe, sourcing statistics whose sign changes under point reflection. The best constraints on such phenomena have come from the Planck temperature fluctuations; however, this is already cosmic-variance-limited down to relatively small scales, thus only small improvements are expected in the future. Here, we search for signatures of parity-violation in the polarized CMB, using the Planck PR4 $T$- and $E$-mode data. We perform both a simulation-based blind test for any parity-violating signal at $\ell&lt;518$, and a targeted search for primordial $U(1)$ gauge fields (and the amplitudes of a generic collapsed model) at $\ell&lt;2000$. In all cases, we find no evidence for new physics, with the model-independent test finding consistency with the FFP10/NPIPE simulation suite at $(-)0.4\sigma$, and the gauge field test constraining the fractional amplitude of gauge fields during inflation to be below $6\times 10^{-19}$ at $95\%$ confidence level for a fiducial model. The addition of polarization data can significantly improve the constraints, depending on the particular model of primordial physics, and the bounds will tighten significantly with the inclusion of smaller-scale information.</description>

      <title>Relativistic second-order dissipative and anisotropic fluid dynamics in the relaxation-time approximation for an ideal gas of massive particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study all transport coefficients of second-order dissipative fluid dynamics derived by V. E. Ambrus et al. [Phys. Rev. D 106, 076005 (2022)] from the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation for the collision integral. These transport coefficients are computed for a classical ideal gas of massive particles, with and without taking into account the conservation of intrinsic quantum numbers. Through rigorous comparison between kinetic theory, second-order dissipative fluid dynamics, and leading-order anisotropic fluid dynamics for a (0+1)--dimensional boost-invariant flow scenario, we show that both fluid-dynamical theories describe the early far-from-equilibrium stage of the expansion reasonably well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we set up the numerical S-matrix bootstrap by using the crossing symmetric dispersion relation (CSDR) to write down Roy equations for the partial waves. As a motivation behind examining the local version of the CSDR, we derive a new, crossing symmetric, 3-channels-plus-contact-terms representation of the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in string theory that converges everywhere except at the poles. We then focus on gapped theories and give novel analytic and semi-analytic derivations of several bounds on low-energy data. We examine the high-energy behaviour of the experimentally measurable rho-parameter, introduced by Khuri and Kinoshita and defined as the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the amplitude in the forward limit. Contrary to expectations, we find numerical evidence that there could be multiple changes in the sign of this ratio before it asymptotes at high energies. We compare our approach with other existing numerical methods and find agreement, with improvement in convergence.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Isocurvature from Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isocurvature fluctuations, where the relative number density of particle species spatially varies, can be generated from initially adiabatic, or curvature, fluctuations if the various species fall out of or were never in thermal equilibrium. The freezing of the thermal relic dark matter abundance is one such case, but for modes that are still outside the horizon the amplitude is highly suppressed and originates from the small change in the local expansion rate due to the local space curvature produced by the curvature fluctuation. We establish a simple separate-universe method for calculating this generation that applies to both freeze-in and freeze-out models, identify three critical epochs for this process, and give general scaling behaviors for the amplitude in each case: the freezing epoch, the kinetic decoupling epoch and matter-radiation equality. Freeze-out models are typically dominated by spatially modulated annihilation from the latter epochs and can generate much larger isocurvature fluctuations compared with typical freeze-in models, albeit still very small and observationally allowed by cosmic microwave background measurements. We illustrate these results with concrete models where the dark matter interactions are vector or scalar mediated.</description>

      <title>Analytic Formulae for Inflationary Correlators with Dynamical Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive fields can imprint unique oscillatory features on primordial correlation functions or inflationary correlators, which is dubbed the cosmological collider signal. In this work, we analytically investigate the effects of a time-dependent mass of a scalar field on inflationary correlators, extending previous numerical studies and implementing techniques developed in the cosmological bootstrap program. The time-dependent mass is in general induced by couplings to the slow-roll inflaton background, with particularly significant effects in the case of non-derivative couplings. By linearly approximating the time dependence, the mode function of the massive scalar is computed analytically, on which we derive analytic formulae for two-, three-, and four-point correlators with the tree-level exchange of the massive scalar. The obtained formulae are utilized to discuss the phenomenological impacts on the power spectrum and bispectrum, and it is found that the scaling behavior of the bispectrum in the squeezed configuration, i.e., the cosmological collider signal, is modified from a time-dependent Boltzmann suppression. By investigating the scaling behavior in detail, we are in principle able to determine the non-derivative couplings between the inflaton and the massive particle.</description>

      <title>Bjorken and threshold limit of a space-like structure function in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate a simple coordinate-space structure function $f_a(z^2m^2,\lambda)$ in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model to next-to-leading order in the large $N$ expansion. We analytically perform the twist expansion in the Bjorken limit through double Mellin-representations. Hard and non-perturbative scaling functions at various powers are naturally generated in their Borel representations. At leading power (LP), the collinear factorization formula is explicitly verified, and the issue of ``scale-dependency'' of perturbative and non-perturbative functions is explained naturally. At NLP, there are three series of non-perturbative functions and the related hard functions. At higher powers, explicit forms for all the contributions are also obtained. The renormalon cancellation at $t=n$ between hard functions at powers $p$ and the non-perturbative functions at powers $p+n$ are explicitly verified to all powers. Simple expressions for the leading power non-perturbative functions are also provided both in coordinate space and momentum-fraction spaces ($0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$) with ``zero-mode-type'' subtractions at $\alpha=0$ discussed in detail. We also investigate the threshold expansion of the structure function and its relation to the twist expansion.</description>
