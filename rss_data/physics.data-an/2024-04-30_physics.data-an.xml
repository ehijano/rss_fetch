      <title>Advanced analysis of single-molecule spectroscopic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Full SMS, a multipurpose graphical user interface (GUI)-based software package for analysing single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) data. SMS typically delivers multiparameter data -- such as fluorescence brightness, lifetime, and spectra -- of molecular- or nanometre-scale particles such as single dye molecules, quantum dots, or fluorescently labelled biological macromolecules. Full SMS allows an unbiased statistical analysis of fluorescence brightness through level resolution and clustering, analysis of fluorescence lifetimes through decay fitting, as well as the calculation of second-order correlation functions and the display of fluorescence spectra and raster-scan images. Additional features include extensive data filtering options, a custom HDF5-based file format, and flexible data export options. The software is open source and written in Python but GUI-based so it may be used without any programming knowledge. A multi-process architecture was employed for computational efficiency. The software is also designed to be easily extendable to include additional import data types and analysis capabilities.</description>

      <title>Unifying Simulation and Inference with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been many applications of deep neural networks to detector calibrations and a growing number of studies that propose deep generative models as automated fast detector simulators. We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.</description>

      <title>High dimensional analysis reveals conservative sharpening and a stochastic edge of stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent empirical and theoretical work has shown that the dynamics of the large eigenvalues of the training loss Hessian have some remarkably robust features across models and datasets in the full batch regime. There is often an early period of progressive sharpening where the large eigenvalues increase, followed by stabilization at a predictable value known as the edge of stability. Previous work showed that in the stochastic setting, the eigenvalues increase more slowly - a phenomenon we call conservative sharpening. We provide a theoretical analysis of a simple high-dimensional model which shows the origin of this slowdown. We also show that there is an alternative stochastic edge of stability which arises at small batch size that is sensitive to the trace of the Neural Tangent Kernel rather than the large Hessian eigenvalues. We conduct an experimental study which highlights the qualitative differences from the full batch phenomenology, and suggests that controlling the stochastic edge of stability can help optimization.</description>

      <title>Recent Neutrino Parameters Impact on the Effective Majorana Neutrino Mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.</description>

      <title>Landmark Alternating Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternating Diffusion (AD) is a commonly applied diffusion-based sensor fusion algorithm. While it has been successfully applied to various problems, its computational burden remains a limitation. Inspired by the landmark diffusion idea considered in the Robust and Scalable Embedding via Landmark Diffusion (ROSELAND), we propose a variation of AD, called Landmark AD (LAD), which captures the essence of AD while offering superior computational efficiency. We provide a series of theoretical analyses of LAD under the manifold setup and apply it to the automatic sleep stage annotation problem with two electroencephalogram channels to demonstrate its application.</description>

      <title>Guidelines for the Creation of Analysis Ready Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globally, there is an increased need for guidelines to produce high-quality data outputs for analysis. No framework currently exists that provides guidelines for a comprehensive approach to producing analysis ready data (ARD). Through critically reviewing and summarising current literature, this paper proposes such guidelines for the creation of ARD. The guidelines proposed in this paper inform ten steps in the generation of ARD: ethics, project documentation, data governance, data management, data storage, data discovery and collection, data cleaning, quality assurance, metadata, and data dictionary. These steps are illustrated through a substantive case study that aimed to create ARD for a digital spatial platform: the Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas (ACYWA).</description>
