      <title>Comparison of the effectiveness and costs of hepatitis A vaccination strategies to mitigate future deaths in the Republic of Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved hygiene and infant vaccinations have led to age specific variations in hepatitis A antibody prevalence in Korea, with lower rates among individuals in their 20s to 40s. Given that the fatality rate of hepatitis A increases for those aged 50 and older, the low immunity level among younger adults indicates a future risk of increased deaths in older age groups without additional preventive measures.We developed an age structured transmission model to assess the impact of adult vaccination, assuming it begins in 2025. The 20s age group was modeled with an additional compartment to account for hepatitis A vaccination administered to military recruits. Vaccination strategies targeting the 20s to 30s and 40s to 50s age groups were compared, considering antibody testing costs for the latter in Korea and focusing on projected deaths over approximately 50 years. When the total vaccination cost is fixed, targeting the 40s to 50s group covers 20% fewer individuals than the 20s to 30s group but yields a 1.3 to 1.5 fold greater reduction in deaths. When the total vaccine supply is fixed, targeting the 40s to 50s group is 1.2 times more expensive but yields a 1.7 to 1.8 fold greater reduction in deaths than the 20s to 30s group. Moreover, including a second dose for military personnel in the 20s to 30s group has minimal impact on reducing deaths. Preventive measures for adults may be necessary to reduce future hepatitis A related deaths. Vaccinating the 40s to 50s group would be more effective in reducing deaths than vaccinating the 20s to 30s group.</description>

      <title>Defining and Estimating Outcomes Directly Averted by a Vaccination Program when Rollout Occurs Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating the total deaths averted by vaccination has been of great public health interest. Instead of estimating total deaths averted by vaccination among both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, some studies empirically estimated only "directly averted" deaths among vaccinated individuals, typically suggesting that vaccines prevented more deaths overall than directly due to the indirect effect. Here, we define the causal estimand to quantify outcomes "directly averted" by vaccination$\unicode{x2014}$i.e., the impact of vaccination for vaccinated individuals, holding vaccination coverage fixed$\unicode{x2014}$for vaccination at multiple time points, and show that this estimand is a lower bound on the total outcomes averted when the indirect effect is non-negative. We develop an unbiased estimator for the causal estimand in a one-stage randomized controlled trial (RCT) and explore the bias of a popular "hazard difference" estimator frequently used in empirical studies. We show that even in an RCT, the hazard difference estimator is biased if vaccination has a non-null effect, as it fails to incorporate the greater depletion of susceptibles among the unvaccinated individuals. In simulations, the overestimation is small for averted deaths when infection-fatality rate is low, as for many important pathogens. However, the overestimation can be large for averted infections given a high basic reproduction number. Additionally, we define and compare estimand and estimators for avertible outcomes (i.e., outcomes that could have been averted by vaccination, but were not due to failure to vaccinate). Future studies can explore the identifiability of the causal estimand in observational settings.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cholera Dynamics Under Food Insecurity and Environmental Contamination: A Multi-Patch Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-patch model of cholera transmission integrating environmental contamination, human mobility, and nutritional vulnerability. The population is stratified by food security status, and transmission occurs via human contact, bacteria in the environment and contaminated food. We derive the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ analyze the stability of the disease-free equilibria and show a forward bifurcation. Numerical simulations illustrate how food insecurity amplifies outbreak severity and mortality. The model highlights the role of spatial heterogeneity and socio-environmental factors in shaping cholera dynamics. Moreover, results show the impact of sinks inside starting epidemic.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Two Species with Density-Dependent Interactions in a Mutualistic Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutualistic interactions, where individuals from different species can benefit from each other, are widespread across ecosystems. This study develops a general deterministic model of mutualism involving two populations, assuming that mutualism may involve both costs and benefits for the interacting individuals, leading to density-dependent effects on the dynamics of the two species. This framework aims at generalizing pre-existing models, by allowing the ecological interactions to transition from mutualistic to parasitic when the respective densities of interacting species change. Through ordinary differential equations and phase portrait analysis, we derive general principles governing these systems, identifying sufficient conditions for the emergence of certain dynamic behaviors. In particular, we show that limit cycles can arise when interactions include parasitic phases but are absent in strictly mutualistic regimes. This framework provides a general approach for characterizing the population dynamics of interacting species and highlights the effect of the transitions from mutualism to parasitism due to density dependence.</description>

      <title>Mosquito population suppression models with seasonality and d-concave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sterile insect technique has emerged recently as a biologically secure and effective tool for suppressing wild mosquito pests. To improve the performance of this strategy, understanding the interaction between wild and sterile mosquitoes is critical. Although the common models for this biological problem are scalar equations, they are remarkably resistant to the mathematical analysis. In a series of papers, Due\~nas, Nu\~nez, and Obaya have developed a powerful approach to describe the dynamical behavior of scalar equations with d-concave nonlinearities, a property typically related to the sign of the third derivative. In this paper, we show that, for periodic equations coming from population dynamics, this condition is typically associated with the positive sign of the third derivative of the inverse of the Poincar\'e map. This remark allows us to simplify some arguments in the periodic case and obtain a deep geometrical understanding of the global bifurcation patterns. Consequently, the dynamical behavior of the models is analyzed in terms of simple and testable conditions. Our methodology allows us to describe precisely the dynamical behavior of the common mosquito population suppression models, even incorporating seasonality. This paper generalizes and improves many recent results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Individual or collective treatments: how to target antimicrobial use to limit the spread of \textit{Mannheimia haemolytica} among beef cattle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The overuse of antibiotics has become a major global concern due to its role in diminishing treatment effectiveness and positively selecting antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. This issue is particularly important in the beef cattle sector, where Bovine Respiratory Diseases (BRD) impose significant economic and welfare burdens. BRD are complex, multifactorial conditions primarily affecting young calves and feedlot cattle, caused by a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens, environmental factors, and stressors. Despite efforts to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU), the cattle production system remains heavily reliant on antibiotics to control BRD, often through the implementation of collective treatments to prevent outbreaks. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of various treatment practices on the spread of BRD, specifically focusing on criteria for implementing collective treatments. Using a mechanistic stochastic model, we simulated the spread of \textit{Mannheimia haemolytica} in a multi-pen fattening operation under sixteen different scenarios, considering pen composition, individual risk levels, and treatment strategies. Our findings suggest that an alternative criterion for collective treatments based on the speed of the disease spread, could reduce BRD incidence and AMU more effectively than conventional methods. This research highlights the importance of responsible treatment practices and the potential benefits of novel criteria for collective treatment strategies in improving animal health. Moreover, it emphasizes the need for transparency on the exposure to risk factors along the production chain.</description>

      <title>Spatially Structured Flocking in a Proliferating Population of Self-Propelled Organisms without Explicit Alignment Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is well established that self-propelled particles with alignment interactions can exhibit orientational order, the impact of self-replication and annihilation, which are key characteristics in cellular systems, on spatiotemporal order remains poorly understood. To explore the interplay between self-propulsion and self-replication, we introduce the active Brownian bug (ABB) model, in which self-propelled agents undergo stochastic, density-dependent replication and constant-rate death. Despite the absence of alignment interactions, the system exhibits flocking behavior characterized by high orientational order, while maintaining ordered hexagonal arrays. This emergent order arises from stochastic birth and death processes, offering a novel mechanism for flocking in proliferating cellular populations.</description>

      <title>Sequential Monte Carlo Squared for online inference in stochastic epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective epidemic modeling and surveillance require computationally efficient methods that can continuously update estimates as new data becomes available. This paper explores the application of an online variant of Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (O-SMC$^2$) to the stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for real-time epidemic tracking. The particularity of O-SMC$^2$ lies in its ability to update the parameters using a particle Metropolis-Hastings kernel, ensuring that the target distribution remains invariant while only utilizing a fixed window of recent observations. This feature enables timely parameter updates and significantly enhances computational efficiency compared to the standard SMC$^2$, which processes the entire dataset. First, we demonstrate the efficiency of O-SMC$^2$ on simulated data, where both the parameters and the observation process are known. We then apply the method to a real-world COVID-19 dataset from Ireland, successfully tracking the epidemic trajectory and estimating the time-dependent reproduction number of the disease. Our results show that O-SMC$^2$ provides highly accurate online estimates of both static and dynamic epidemiological parameters while substantially reducing computational costs. These findings highlight the potential of O-SMC$^2$ for real-time epidemic monitoring and supporting adaptive public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Towards a compleat theory of ecosystem size spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The regularity of ecosystem size spectra is one of the most intriguing and relevant phenomena on our planet. Aquatic size spectra generally show a log-linearly downtrending shape, following a power-law distribution. A constant log-linear slope has been reported for many marine pelagic ecosystems, often being approximately b = -1. Conversely, there are variable trophic-level-biomass relationships (trophic pyramids). The contrasting observations of a constant biomass (M) spectrum slope and highly variable biomass pyramids may be defined as the constant size spectra-variable trophic dynamics paradox. Here, a 'mass-specific predator-prey-efficiency theory of size spectra' (PETS) is presented and discussed. A thorough analysis of available data, literature and models result in the conclusion that most pelagic marine ecosystems are controlled by trophic processes such as resource-limit stress (bottom-up control) and top-down regulation, with a key role of the maximum carrying capacity of large-sized organisms. This has relevant consequences for the prediction and interpretation of size spectra and the context of fisheries, whaling, and the introduction of exotic predators (e.g., lionfish). The complete size spectrum obtained in situ, including living organisms and non-living particles (e.g., for data from LOPC and UVP) is discussed. This paper is intended as a plea for the integration of modeling approaches, to understand and integrate data and processes across communities including bacteria, phytoplankton, fish and mammals, considering the effect of non-organismic particles.</description>

      <title>The effect of predation on the dynamics of Chronic Wasting Disease in deer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a neurological disease impacting deer, elk, moose, and other cervid populations and is caused by a misfolded protein known as a prion. CWD is difficult to control due to the persistence of prions in the environment. Prions can remain infectious for more than a decade and have been found in soil as well as other environmental vectors, such as ticks and plants. Here, we provide a bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of CWD spread in a cervid population, and use a modification of the Gillespie algorithm to explore if wolves can be used as an ecological control strategy to limit the spread of the disease in several relevant scenarios. We then analytically compute the probability that the disease spreads given one infected member enters a fully healthy population and the probability of elimination, given a fully susceptible population and remaining prions in the environment. From our analysis, we conclude that wolves can be used as an effective control strategy to limit the spread of CWD in cervid populations, and hunting or other means of lowering the susceptible population are beneficial to controlling the spread of CWD, although it is important to note that inferring biologically relevant parameters from the existing data is an ongoing challenge for this system.</description>
