      <title>Predicting mosquito flight behavior using Bayesian dynamical systems learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mosquito-borne diseases cause several hundred thousand deaths every year. Deciphering mosquito host-seeking behavior is essential to prevent disease transmission through mosquito capture and surveillance. Despite recent substantial progress, we currently lack a comprehensive quantitative understanding of how visual and other sensory cues guide mosquitoes to their targets. Here, we combined 3D infrared tracking of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with Bayesian dynamical systems inference to learn a quantitative biophysical model of mosquito host-seeking behavior. Trained on more than 41,000,000 mosquito free-flight trajectories recorded in the presence of visual and carbon dioxide cues, the model accurately predicts how mosquitoes respond to human targets. Our results provide a quantitative foundation for optimizing mosquito capture and control strategies, a key step towards mitigating the impact of mosquito-borne diseases.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Arterial Irregularity On Clinical Parameters Using Reduced Order CFD Models In Stenosed Coronary Artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a novel approach that integrates patient-specific Multi-slice CT scans into CAD models, using a one-dimensional numerical framework to assess varying degrees of coronary artery stenosis. The computational analysis encompasses the entire arterial tree, with a particular focus on stenosed coronary arteries modeled analytically. Key parameters, such as area and velocity, are derived from one-dimensional characteristic equations based on forward and backward characteristic variables. A resistance model with zero reflection coefficient and realistic pressure waveform inputs is applied at the outflow and inflow, respectively. The global characteristics captured by the 1D model serve as boundary conditions for a 2D axisymmetric model that focuses on local characteristics. The numerical solvers are validated against existing literature, ensuring grid independence. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and Instantaneous wave-free Ratio (iFR) are calculated using various non-Newtonian models across different stenosis severities. The study also investigates the impact of lesion irregularity in stenosed coronary arteries, finding that irregular arteries exhibit lower FFR and iFR values and higher pressure drops, indicating increased blood flow resistance. This method provides a reliable, non-invasive diagnostic tool for evaluating the functional severity of irregular coronary artery stenosis in clinical settings, effectively capturing both global and local hemodynamic characteristics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the neural origin of non-Euclidean visual space and analysis of visual phenomena using information geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper aims to develop a mathematical model concerning the visual perception of spatial information. It is a challenging problem in theoretical neuroscience to investigate how the spatial information of the objects in the physical space is encoded and decoded in the neural processes in the brain. In the past, researchers conjectured the existence of an abstract visual space where spatial information processing takes place. Based on several experimental data it was conjectured that the said psychological manifold is non-Euclidean. However, the consideration of the neural origin of the non-Euclidean character of the visual space was not explicit in the models. In the present paper, we showed that the neural mechanism and specifically the Fisher information contained in the neural population code plays the role of energy-momentum tensor to create the space-dependent metric tensor resulting in a curved space described by a curvature tensor. The theoretical prediction of information geometry regarding the emergence of curved manifolds in the presence of the Fisher information is verified in the present work in the domain of neural processing of spatial information at mid-level vision. Several well-known phenomena of visual optics are analyzed using the notion of non-Euclidean visual space, the geodesics of the space, and the Fisher-Rao metric as the suitable psychometric distance.</description>

      <title>From the perceptron to the cerebellum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The perceptron has served as a prototypical neuronal learning machine in the physics community interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence, which included G\'erard Toulouse as one of its prominent figures. It has also been used as a model of Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, a brain structure involved in motor learning, in the early influential theories of David Marr and James Albus. We review these theories, more recent developments in the field, and highlight questions of current interest.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Abiogenesis: Thermodynamic Selection and the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17975v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of life is often approached through the lens of replication, heredity, or molecular specificity. This paper proposes a thermodynamic framework in which the emergence of life is driven by the persistence of reaction pathways that align energetically with fluctuating environmental inputs. We define a reaction viability inequality based on energy input, return, resilience, and expenditure, which selects for persistent chemical configurations without invoking heredity or genetic encoding.
  We further incorporate entropic dynamics and spatial constraints into an augmented persistence function, showing that systems far from equilibrium can simultaneously increase global entropy while supporting localized chemical order. These refinements lead to the development of the Thermodynamic Abiogenesis Likelihood Model (TALM), a probabilistic extension that estimates the likelihood of persistence-driven selection under various prebiotic and planetary scenarios.
  This framework redefines the conditions under which life-like organization may emerge and provides a testable, general theory for abiogenesis grounded in physical law.</description>

      <title>Active drive towards elastic spinodals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter, exemplified by adaptive living materials such as the actomyosin cytoskeleton, can navigate material parameter space dynamically, leading to unconventional mechanical responses. In particular, it can self-drive toward elastic spinodal regimes, where inhomogeneous floppy modes induce elastic degeneracy and enable a controlled interplay between rigidity loss and recovery. Proximity to such marginal states leads to stress localization and the formation of force chains that can be actively assembled and disassembled. Here, we extend the classical notion of spinodal states to active solids and demonstrate how these extreme mechanical regimes can be actively accessed. Moreover, we show that in a nonlinear setting, crossing elastic spinodals generates new energy wells and makes force channeling an intrinsic feature of the emerging microstructure.</description>

      <title>Characterization of phospholipid-cholesterol bilayers as self-assembled amphiphile block polymers that contain headgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cholesterol is known to modulate the structure and function of biological membranes. In this study, we use self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to investigate phospholipid/cholesterol bilayer membranes modeled with two types of diblock copolymers. These copolymer-based bilayers serve as biomimetic platforms with applications in areas such as drug delivery. Our simulations identify a minimum free energy configuration characterized by phospholipid tails tilted relative to the membrane normal. The model quantitatively captures the well-known area condensation effect as cholesterol concentration increases, along with membrane thickening and reduced tilt angle. Thermodynamically, we observe a linear dependence between cholesterol's chemical potential and its concentration within the 37-50% range, consistent with experimental results. Additionally, we analyze the effects of block copolymer length and headgroup interactions on bilayer structure. Interactions between phospholipid headgroups and the solvent emerge as the most influential. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding cholesterol's regulatory role in membrane structure and mechanics.</description>

      <title>Inferring stochastic dynamics with growth from cross-sectional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, \emph{unbalanced} probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</description>
