      <title>Inducing Riesz and orthonormal bases in $L^2$ via composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate perturbations of orthonormal bases of $L^2$ via a composition operator $C_h$ induced by a mapping $h$. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the mapping $h$ required for the perturbed sequence to form an orthonormal or Riesz basis. Restricting our analysis to differentiable mappings, we reveal that all Riesz bases of the given form are induced by bi-Lipschitz mappings. In addition, we discuss implications of these results for approximation theory, highlighting the potential of using bijective neural networks to construct complete sequences with favorable approximation properties.</description>

      <title>Tent Carleson measures and superposition operators on Hardy type tent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we completely characterize the positive Borel measures $\mu$ on the unit ball $\mathbb{B}_n$ of $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that the Carleson embedding from holomorphic Hardy type tent spaces $\mathcal{HT}^p_{q,\alpha}$ into the tent spaces $T^t_s(\mu)$ is bounded for all $0&lt;p,q,s,t&lt;\infty$ and $\alpha&gt;-n-1$. As an application, we determine the indices $0&lt;p,q,s,t&lt;\infty$ and $\alpha,\beta&gt;-n-1$ such that the inclusion $\mathcal{HT}^p_{q,\alpha}\subset\mathcal{HT}^t_{s,\beta}$ holds, which allows us to completely characterize the nonlinear superposition operators between Hardy type tent spaces.</description>

      <title>On commutants of composition operators embedded into $C_0$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C_\varphi$ be a composition operator acting on the Hardy space of the unit disc $H^p$ ($1\leq p &lt; \infty$), which is embedded in a $C_0$-semigroup of composition operators $\mathcal{T}=(C_{\varphi_t})_{t\geq 0}.$ We investigate whether the commutant or the bicommutant of $C_\varphi$, or the commutant of the semigroup $\mathcal{T}$, are isomorphic to subalgebras of continuous functions defined on a connected set. In particular, it allows us to derive results about the existence of non-trivial idempotents (and non-trivial orthogonal projections if $p=2$) lying in such sets. Our methods also provide results concerning the minimality of the commutant and the double commutant property, in the sense that they coincide with the closure in the weak operator topology of the unital algebra generated by the operator. Moreover, some consequences regarding the extended eigenvalues and the strong compactness of such operators are derived. This extends previous results of Lacruz, Le\'on-Saavedra, Petrovic and Rodr\'iguez-Piazza, Fern\'andez-Valles and Lacruz and Shapiro on linear fractional composition operators acting on $H^2$.</description>

      <title>Infinite dimensional dynamical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Completely positive trace preserving maps are widely used in quantum information theory. These are mostly studied using the master equation perspective. A central part in this theory is to study whether a given system of dynamical maps $\{\Lambda_t: t \ge 0\}$ is Markovian or non-Markovian. We study the problem when the underlying Hilbert space is of infinite dimensional. We construct a sufficient condition for checking P (resp. CP) divisibility of dynamical maps. We construct several examples where the underlying Hilbert space may not be of finite dimensional. We also give a special emphasis on Gaussian dynamical maps and get a version of our result in it.</description>

      <title>Functional measures associated to operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every operator in $L^{2}$ has an associated measure on a space of functions and prove that it can be used to find solutions to abstract Cauchy problems, including partial differential equations. We find explicit formulas to compute the integral of functions with respect to this measure and develop approximate formulas in terms of a perturbative expansion. We show that this method can be used to represent solutions of classical equations, such as the diffusion and Fokker-Plank equations, as Wiener and Martin-Siggia-Rose-Jansen-de Dominics integrals, and propose an extension to paths in infinite dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>The Variable Muckenhoupt Weight Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p(\cdot):\ \mathbb R^n\to(0,\infty)$ be a variable exponent function and $X$ a ball quasi-Banach function space. In this paper, we first study the relationship between two kinds of variable weights $\mathcal{W}_{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $A_{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Then, by regarding the weighted variable Lebesgue space $L^{p(\cdot)}_{\omega}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $\omega\in\mathcal{W}_{p(\cdot)}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ as a special case of $X$ and applying known results of the Hardy-type space $H_{X}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ associated with $X$, we further obtain several equivalent characterizations of the weighted variable Hardy space $H^{p(\cdot)}_{\omega}(\rn)$ and the boundedness of some sublinear operators on $H^{p(\cdot)}_{\omega}(\rn)$. All of these results coincide with or improve existing ones, or are completely new.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of solutions to stochastic hybrid models of gene regulatory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper by Kurasov, L\"uck, Mugnolo and Wolf, a hybrid gene regulatory network was proposed to model gene expression dynamics by using a stochastic system of coupled partial differential equations. This approach approximates protein counts in cells by modelling them as distributions. In a follow-up paper, the existence and strong convergence of the solutions to equilibrium was proven. In this paper, we make use of a recent convergence theorem for stochastic, irreducible semigroups that contain partial integral operators. In particular, we improve upon their results by showing that the convergence rate is independent of the initial distribution of proteins, therefore proving that the solutions converge not only strongly but even uniformly to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic functions on complex Banach lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the algebraic, analytic and lattice properties of regular homogeneous polynomials and holomorphic functions on complex Banach lattices. We show that the theory of power series with regular terms is closer to the theory of functions of several complex variables than the theory of holomorphic functions on Banach spaces. We extend the concept of the Bohr radius to Banach lattices and show that it provides us with a lower bound for the ratio between the radius of regular convergence and the radius of convergence of a regular holomorphic function. This allows us to show that in finite dimensions the radius of convergence of the Taylor series of a holomorphic function coincides with the radius of convergence of its monomial expansion but that on $\ell_p$ these two radii can be radically different.</description>

      <title>Continuous operators from spaces of Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of continuous (linear) operators from the Banach spaces $\mbox{Lip}_0(M)$ of Lipschitz functions on infinite metric spaces $M$ vanishing at a distinguished point and from their predual spaces $\mathcal{F}(M)$ onto certain Banach spaces, including $C(K)$-spaces and the spaces $c_0$ and $\ell_1$. For pairs of spaces $\mbox{Lip}_0(M)$ and $C(K)$ we prove that if they are endowed with topologies weaker than the norm topology, then usually no continuous (linear or not) surjection exists between those spaces. It is also showed that if a metric space $M$ contains a bilipschitz copy of the unit sphere $S_{c_0}$ of the space $c_0$, then $\mbox{Lip}_0(M)$ admits a continuous operator onto $\ell_1$ and hence onto $c_0$. Using this, we provide several conditions for a space $M$ implying that $\mbox{Lip}_0(M)$ is not a Grothendieck space. Finally, we obtain a new characterization of the Schur property for Lipschitz-free spaces: a space $\mathcal{F}(M)$ has the Schur property if and only if for every discrete metric space $N$ with cardinality $d(M)$ the spaces $\mathcal{F}(M)$ and $\mathcal{F}(N)$ are weakly sequentially homeomorphic.</description>

      <title>L\'evy measures on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an explicit characterisation of L\'evy measures on both $L^p$-spaces and UMD Banach spaces. In the case of $L^p$-spaces, L\'evy measures are characterised by an integrability condition, which directly generalises the known description of L\'evy measures on sequence spaces. The latter has been the only known description of L\'evy measures on infinite dimensional Banach spaces that are not Hilbert. L\'evy measures on UMD Banach spaces are characterised by the finiteness of the expectation of a random {\gamma}-radonifying norm. Although this description is more abstract, it reduces to simple integrability conditions in the case of $L^p$-spaces.</description>

      <title>Symmetric monoidal categories of conveniently-constructible Banach bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a continuously-normed Banach bundle $\mathcal{E}$ over a compact Hausdorff space $X$ whose space of sections is algebraically finitely-generated (f.g.) over $C(X)$ is locally trivial (and hence the section space is projective f.g over $C(X)$); this answers a question of I. Gogi\'c. As a preliminary we also provide sufficient conditions for a quotient bundle to be continuous phrased in terms of the Vietoris continuity of the unit-ball maps attached to the bundles. Related results include (a) the fact that the category of topologically f.g. continuous Banach bundles over $X$ is symmetric monoidal under the (fiber-wise-maximal) tensor product, (b) the full faithfulness of the global-section functor from topologically f.g. continuous bundles to $C(X)$-modules and (c) the consequent identification of the algebraically f.g. bundles as precisely the rigid objects in the aforementioned symmetric monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Negativity-preserving transforms of tuples of symmetric matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared to the entrywise transforms which preserve positive semidefiniteness, those leaving invariant the inertia of symmetric matrices reveal a surprising rigidity. We first obtain the classification of negativity preservers by combining recent advances in matrix analysis with some novel arguments using well chosen test matrices. We continue with the analogous classification in the multi-variable setting, revealing a striking separation of variables, with absolute monotonicity on one side and homotheties on the other. We conclude with the complex analogue of this result.</description>
