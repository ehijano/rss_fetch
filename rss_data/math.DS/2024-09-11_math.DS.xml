      <title>Periodic points of endperiodic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $g\colon L\rightarrow L$ be an atoroidal, endperiodic map on an infinite type surface $L$ with no boundary and finitely many ends, each of which is accumulated by genus. By work of Landry, Minsky, and Taylor, $g$ is isotopic to a spun pseudo-Anosov map $f$. We show that spun pseudo-Anosov maps minimize the number of periodic points of period $n$ for sufficiently high $n$ over all maps in their homotopy class, strengthening a theorem of Landry, Minsky, and Taylor. We also show that the same theorem holds for atoroidal Handel--Miller maps when you only consider periodic points that lie in the intersection of the stable and unstable laminations.</description>

      <title>Positive entropy actions by higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study smooth actions by lattices $\Gamma$ in higher-rank simple Lie groups $G$ assuming one element of the action acts with positive topological entropy and prove a number of new rigidity results. For lattices $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ acting on $n$-manifolds, if the action has positive topological entropy we show the lattice must be commensurable with $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$. Moreover, such actions admit an absolutely continuous probability measure with positive metric entropy; adapting arguments by Katok and Rodriguez Hertz, we show such actions are measurably conjugate to affine actions on (infra)tori.
  In our main technical arguments, we study families of probability measures invariant under sub-actions of the induced $G$-action on an associated fiber bundle. To control entropy properties of such measures, in the appendix we establish certain upper semicontinuity of entropy under weak-$*$ convergence, adapting classical results of Yomdin and Newhouse.</description>

      <title>Almost automorphic subshifts with finiteness conditions for the boundary of the separating cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study orbits of proximal pairs in almost automorphic subshifts. The corresponding orbits in the maximal equicontinuous factor are precisely those orbits that intersect the boundary of the subshift's separating cover. We impose certain finiteness conditions on this boundary and investigate the resulting consequences for the subshift, for instance in terms of complexity or the relations between proximal and asymptotic pairs. The last part of our article deals with Toeplitz subshifts without a finite boundary. There we treat the question of necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the existence of a factor subshift with a finite boundary. Throughout the whole article, we provide numerous Toeplitz subshifts as examples and counterexamples to illustrate our findings and the necessity of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Existence of ACIM for Piecewise Expanding $C^{1+\varepsilon}$ maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Lasota-Yorke inequality for the Frobenius-Perron Operator of a piecewise expanding $C^{1+\varepsilon}$ map of an interval. By adapting this inequality to satisfy the assumptions of the Ionescu-Tulcea and Marinescu ergodic theorem \cite{ionescu1950}, we demonstrate the existence of an absolutely continuous invariant measure (ACIM) for the map. Furthermore, we prove the quasi-compactness of the Frobenius-Perron operator induced by the map. Additionally, we explore significant properties of the system, including weak mixing and exponential decay of correlations.</description>

      <title>Intermediate dimensions of Moran sets and their visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate dimensions are a class of new fractal dimensions which provide a spectrum of dimensions interpolating between the Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions.
  In this paper, we study the intermediate dimensions of Moran sets. Moran sets may be regarded as a generalization of self-similar sets generated by using different class of similar mappings at each level with unfixed translations, and this causes the lack of ergodic properties on Moran set. Therefore, the intermediate dimensions do not necessarily exist, and we calculate the upper and lower intermediate dimensions of Moran sets. In particular, we obtain a simplified intermediate dimension formula for homogeneous Moran sets. Moreover, we study the visualization of the upper intermediate dimensions for some homogeneous Moran sets, and we show that their upper intermediate dimensions are given by Mobius transformations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems and their connection to passivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Port-Hamiltonian (pH) systems provide a powerful tool for modeling physical systems. Their energy-based perspective allows for the coupling of various subsystems through energy exchange. Another important class of systems, passive systems, are characterized by their inability to generate energy internally. In this paper, we explore first steps towards understanding the equivalence between passivity and the feasibility of port-Hamiltonian realizations in nonlinear systems. Based on our findings, we present a method to construct port-Hamiltonian representations of a passive system if the dynamics and the Hamiltonian are known.</description>

      <title>Siegel-Veech Constants for Cyclic Covers of Generic Translation Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic number of cylinders, weighted by their area to any non-negative power, on any cyclic branched cover of any generic translation surface in any stratum. Our formulas depend only on topological invariants of the cover and number-theoretic properties of the degree: in particular, the ratio of the related Siegel-Veech constants for the locus of covers and for the base stratum component is independent of the number of branch values. One surprising corollary is that this ratio for $area^3$ Siegel-Veech constants is always equal to the reciprocal of the the degree of the cover. A key ingredient is a classification of the connected components of certain loci of cyclic branched covers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that positive weak solutions for quasilinear parabolic equations on bounded domains subject to homogenous Neumann boundary conditions becme classical and global under the unique condition that the reaction doesn't change sign after certain positive time. We apply this result to reaction diffusion systems and prove global existence of theirs positive weak solutions under the same condition on theirs reactions. The nonlinearities growth isn't taken in consideration. The proof is based on the maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Dynamics Learning for Stiff Collisional-radiative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisional-radiative (CR) models describe the atomic processes in a plasma by tracking the population density in the ground and excited states for each charge state of the atom or ion. These models predict important plasma properties such as charge state distributions and radiative emissivity and opacity. Accurate CR modeling is essential in radiative plasma modeling for magnetic fusion, especially when significant amount of impurities are introduced into the plasmas. In radiative plasma simulations, a CR model, which is a set of high-dimensional stiff ordinary differential equations (ODE), needs to be solved on each grid point in the configuration space, which can overwhelm the plasma simulation cost. In this work, we propose a deep learning method that discovers the latent space and learns its corresponding latent dynamics, which can capture the essential physics to make accurate predictions at much lower online computational cost. To facilitate coupling of the latent space CR dynamics with the plasma simulation model in physical variables, our latent space in the autoencoder must be a grey box, consisting of a physical latent space and a data-driven or blackbox latent space. It has been demonstrated that the proposed architecture can accurately predict both the full-order CR dynamics and the critical physical quantity of interest, the so-called radiative power loss rate.</description>

      <title>Uniform Discreteness of Discrete Orbits of Non-Uniform Lattices in $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the property of uniform discreteness within discrete orbits of non-uniform lattices in $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, acting on $\mathbb{R}^2$ by linear transformations. We provide a new proof of the conditions under which the orbit of a non-uniform lattice in $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ is uniformly discrete, by using Diophantine properties. Our results include a detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the error terms. Focusing on a specific group $\Gamma$ and a discrete orbit of it, $S$, the main result of this paper is that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, three points in $S$ can be found on a horizontal line within distance $\epsilon$ of each other. This gives a partial result toward a conjecture of Leli\`evre. The set $S$ and group $\Gamma$ are respectively the set of long cylinder holonomy vectors, and Veech group, of the "golden L" translation surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the iterations of $x\mapsto |x-\theta|$ random functions with Lipschitz number one, we represent the dynamics as a Markov chain and prove its convergence under mild conditions. We also demonstrate that the Wasserstein metric of any two measures will not increase after the corresponding induced iterations for measures and identify conditions under which a polynomial convergence rate can be achieved in this metric. We also consider an associated nonlinear operator on the space of probability measures and identify its fixed points through an detailed analysis of their characteristic functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a dominant rational self-map $f$ on a quasi-projective variety defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, there is a point whose $f$-orbit is well-defined and its arithmetic degree is arbitrary close to the first dynamical degree of $f$. As an application, we prove that Zariski dense orbit conjecture holds for a birational map defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ such that the first dynamical degree is strictly larger than the third dynamical degree. In particular, the conjecture holds for birational maps on threefolds with first dynamical degree larger than $1$.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Koopman Operator Estimation in Idealized Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning is revolutionizing weather forecasting, with new data-driven models achieving accuracy on par with operational physical models for medium-term predictions. However, these models often lack interpretability, making their underlying dynamics difficult to understand and explain. This paper proposes methodologies to estimate the Koopman operator, providing a linear representation of complex nonlinear dynamics to enhance the transparency of data-driven models. Despite its potential, applying the Koopman operator to large-scale problems, such as atmospheric modeling, remains challenging. This study aims to identify the limitations of existing methods, refine these models to overcome various bottlenecks, and introduce novel convolutional neural network architectures that capture simplified dynamics.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous approximation in nilsystems and the multiplicative thickness of return-time sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the topological dynamical system $(X,T)$, a point $x$ simultaneously approximates a point $y$ if there exists a sequence $n_1$, $n_2$, ... of natural numbers for which $T^{n_i} x$, $T^{2n_i}x$, ..., $T^{k n_i} x$ all tend to $y$. In 1978, Furstenberg and Weiss showed that every system possesses a point which simultaneously approximates itself (a multiply recurrent point) and deduced refinements of van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions. In this paper, we study the denseness of the set of points that are simultaneously approximated by a given point. We show that in a minimal nilsystem, all points simultaneously approximate a $\delta$-dense set of points under a necessarily restricted set of powers of $T$. We tie this theorem to the multiplicative combinatorial properties of return-time sets, showing that all nil-Bohr sets and typical return-time sets in a minimal system are multiplicatively thick in a coset of a multiplicative subsemigroup of the natural numbers. This yields an inhomogeneous multiple recurrence result that generalizes Furstenberg and Weiss' theorem and leads to new enhancements of van der Waerden's theorem. This work relies crucially on continuity in the prolongation relation (the closure of the orbit-closure relation) developed by Auslander, Akin, and Glasner; the theory of rational points and polynomials on nilmanifolds developed by Leibman, Green, and Tao; and the machinery of topological characteristic factors developed recently by Glasner, Huang, Shao, Weiss, and Ye.</description>

      <title>Characterization and dynamics of certain classes of polynomial vector fields on the torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all polynomial vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of degree up to three such that their flow makes the torus $$\mathbb{T}^2=\{(x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3:(x^2+y^2-a^2)^2+z^2-1=0\}~\mbox{with}~a\in (1,\infty)$$ invariant. We also classify cubic Kolmogorov vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ and prove that they exhibit a rational first integral. We study `pseudo-type-$n$' vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ and show that any such vector field is completely integrable. We prove that the Lie bracket of any two quadratic vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ is completely integrable. We explicitly find all cubic vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ which achieve the sharp bounds for the number of invariant meridians and parallels. We present necessary and sufficient conditions when invariant meridians and parallels of cubic vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$ are periodic orbits or limit cycles. We discuss invariant meridians and parallels of pseudo-type-$n$ vector fields as well. Moreover, we characterize the singular points of a class of polynomial vector fields on $\mathbb{T}^2$.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a methodology to prove existence of (fiberwise hyperbolic) real-analytic invariant tori in real-analytic quasi-periodic skew-product dynamical systems that present nearly-invariant tori of the same characteristics. The methodology is based on the application of a Newton-Kantorovich theorem whose hypotheses are tested using Fourier analysis methods for a numerical approximation of the parameterization of an invariant torus.</description>

      <title>On zero entropy homeomorphisms of the pseudo-arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study interval maps $f$ with zero topological entropy that are crooked; i.e. whose inverse limit with $f$ as the single bonding map is the pseudo-arc. We show that there are uncountably many pairwise non-conjugate zero entropy crooked interval maps with different sets of fixed points. We also show that there are uncountably many zero entropy crooked maps that are pairwise non-conjugate and have exactly two fixed points. Furthermore, we provide a characterization of crooked interval maps that are under or above the identity diagonal.</description>

      <title>Non-Expanding Random walks on Homogeneous spaces and Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-expanding random walks on the space of affine lattices and establish a new classification theorem for stationary measures. Further, we prove a theorem that relates the genericity with respect to these random walks to Birkhoff genericity. Finally, we apply these theorems to obtain several results in inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation, especially on fractals.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between notions of additive and multiplicative largeness and its combinatorial applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:1610.09771v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural notions of additive and multiplicative largeness arise from results in Ramsey theory. In this paper, we explain the relationships between these notions for subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and in more general ring-theoretic structures. We show that multiplicative largeness begets additive largeness in three ways and give a collection of examples demonstrating the optimality of these results. We also give a variety of applications arising from the connection between additive and multiplicative largeness. For example, we show that given any $n, k \in \mathbb{N}$, any finite set with fewer than $n$ elements in a sufficiently large finite field can be translated so that each of its elements becomes a non-zero $k^{\text{th}}$ power. We also prove a theorem concerning Diophantine approximation along multiplicatively syndetic subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and a theorem showing that subsets of positive upper Banach density in certain multiplicative sub-semigroups of $\mathbb{N}$ of zero density contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Along the way, we develop a new characterization of upper Banach density in a wide class of amenable semigroups and make explicit the uniformity in recurrence theorems from measure theoretic and topological dynamics. This in turn leads to strengthened forms of classical theorems of Szemer\'edi and van der Waerden on arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Global residue formula for logarithmic indices of foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.07616v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a global residual formula in terms of logarithmic indices for one-dimensional holomorphic foliations, with isolated singularities, and logarithmic along normal crossing divisors. We also give a formula for the total sum of the logarithmic indices if the singular set of the foliation is contained in the invariant divisor. As an application, we provide a formula for the number of singularities in the complement of the invariant divisor on complex projective spaces. Finally, we obtain a Poincar\'e-Hopf type formula for singular normal projective varieties.</description>
