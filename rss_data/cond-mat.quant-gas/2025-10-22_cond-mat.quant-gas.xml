      <title>Dynamically generating superflow in a bosonic ring via phase imprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase imprinting enables the dynamic generation of superflow in bosonic atoms, effectively overcoming traditional limitations such as vortex number constraints and heating effects. However, the mechanisms underlying superflow formation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we reveal these mechanisms by studying the time evolution of the transferred total angular momentum and the quantized current throughout the phase imprinting process, achieved through numerically solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We demonstrate that the Bose gas dynamically acquires angular momentum through the density depletion induced by the phase imprinting potential, whereas quantized currents emerge from azimuthal phase slips accompanied by complete density depletions. Regarding the impact of system parameters, such as interactions, we find that interactions hinder superflow formation, as the azimuthal density distribution becomes less susceptible to the phase imprinting potential. Our findings offer microscopic insights into the dynamic development of superflow during the phase imprinting process and provide valuable guidance for ongoing experimental efforts.</description>

      <title>Experimental preparation of W states through many-body physics on a quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $W$ states are quantum correlated states possessing both bipartite and multipartite entanglement, which makes them useful for several quantum algorithms. We propose a protocol to generate these states by exploiting {\it topological ring frustration}, and implement it on a programmable Rydberg atom array up to 11 qubits, successfully generating many-body $W$ states of Rubidium atoms. Numerical simulations show promising scaling of the algorithm to tens of qubits with near-term achievable updates on the quantum machines. To validate our state preparation protocol and probe quantum entanglement, we devise a fidelity estimator that requires only two sets of measurements. To implement it, we develop a novel and efficient Bayesian state-tomography approach that takes advantage of accurate classical numerical simulations to overcome limitations in the experimental setup. Hence, a lower bound fidelity of around $77\%$ is certified for the experimentally prepared state of 11 qubits. This work provides a state-of-the-art procedure to generate high-quality quantum entangled $W$ states, demonstrating once more how principles of physics can overcome traditional barriers of computation, and be exploited for quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Noise and Reservoir-induced Decoherence in Persistent Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent current is a hallmark of quantum phase coherence. We study the fate of the persistent current in a non-equilibrium setting, where a tight-binding ring is subjected to stochastic disorder as well as a fermionic reservoir attached to each site. We evaluate the current using Keldysh technique and find that it exhibits non-monotonic behavior, suggesting two distinct mechanisms of decoherence. While coupling to the reservoirs introduces a coherence length scale given by the inverse of the coupling strength, the other mechanism is more subtle and driven by the ratio of noise strength to reservoir coupling. The interplay of noise and reservoir constitutes a purely non-equilibrium steady state with a flatter distribution function that we effectively describe using classical rate equations. We discuss possibilities of realizing our findings in ultracold-atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced resonances for the creation of quasi-one-dimensional ultra cold gases of alkali--alkaline-earth dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the role of confinement-induced resonances (CIRs) in low-dimensional ultracold atomic mixtures for the formation of weakly bound dimers. To this end, we examine the scattering properties of a binary atomic mixture confined by a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) potential. In this regime, the interspecies two-body interaction is modeled as an effective 1D zero-range pseudopotential, with a coupling strength $g_\mathrm{1D}$ derived as a function of the three-dimensional scattering length $a$. This framework enables the study of CIRs in harmonically confined systems, with particular attention to the case of mismatched transverse trapping frequencies for the two atomic species. Finally, we consider the Bose-Fermi mixture of $^{87}$Rb and $^{87}$Sr, and identify values of the experimentally accessible parameters for which CIRs can be exploited to create weakly bound molecules.</description>

      <title>Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and non-Gaussian diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out of the equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this paper, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, which increases exponentially with decreasing temperature. The dopant, hereby, only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes at rate $\alpha$, the dopant diffuses with a diffusion coefficient, $D_h$, depending non-monotonically on $\alpha$. It initially increases linearly as $D_h \propto \alpha$ for $\alpha \ll 1$ before dropping off as $\alpha^{-1}$ for $\alpha &gt; 1$. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics features self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion, especially for weak spin exchange. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient $D_h$ follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it is exponentially suppressed upon cooling.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered moire quasicrystal patterns of ultracold Bose gases in twisted bilayer optical lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns in Bose gases confined in twisted bilayer optical lattices via Floquet-engineered intralayer atomic interactions. Dynamical evolutions of the inverse participation ratio and the density wave amplitude reveal the stage for the emergence of moir\'e quasicrystal patterns, whose symmetry can be easily manipulated by the modulation frequencies and amplitudes. Reducing the frequencies and increasing the amplitudes can both facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Notably, a twelve-fold quasicrystal pattern emerges under specific parameters, closely resembling the moir\'e quasicrystal in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space distributions also exhibit high rotational symmetry, which is consistent with the real-space patterns at specific evolution times. Our findings establish a new quantum platform for exploring quasicrystals and their symmetry properties in ultracold bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Antiscarring from eigenstate stacking in a chaotic spinor condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reveal a feature of quantum scarring in systems with many particles: Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by corresponding antiscarred states suppressed there to establish the uniformity of the whole. The uniformity of the underlying phase space is linked to early-time dynamics -- a regime beyond the predictions of random matrix theory and encapsulated in the eigenstate stacking theorem. By extending the domain of the stacking theorem, we apply our theory to a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics have recently been observed in the laboratory. Our work uncovers how scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover of superfluid $^{3}$He in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on superfluid $^3$He in nanoscale-confined geometries, we theoretically investigate the associated phase diagram in a slab geometry and perpendicular magnetic field as the size of confinement is varied. Our analysis is based on minimizing the Ginzburg--Landau free energy for the $3\times 3$ matrix superfluid order parameter for three different boundary conditions. We observe a smooth crossover from the phase diagram of the 3D system to the quasi-2D limit for slab heights of several hundred nanometres and magnetic fields of several kilogauss. We illuminate that, despite the apparent complexity of the underlying equations, many precise numerical and even analytical statements can be made about the phase structure for general values of the coefficients of the free energy functional, which can in turn be used to constrain or measure these parameters. To guide future experimental studies, we compute the phase diagram in dependence of pressure, temperature, slab height, and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-assisted Observation of the Lowest Vibrational Level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ State of Ultracold LiK Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The narrow transition from the lowest rovibrational level of the $\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic ground state to the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ potential provides opportunities for achieving magic-wavelength trapping of ultracold bialkali molecules for enhancing their rotational coherence times. Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\mathrm{A}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 2012, 535, 17-20], we conducted a targeted spectroscopic search and report the first observation of the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state in $^{6}\mathrm{Li}^{40}\mathrm{K}$. The transition frequency from $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},\,v=0,\,J=0&gt;$ to $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0,\,J'=1&gt;$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0&gt;$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0&gt;$ and $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0&gt;$ of $hc\times$10,481.03(2) $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times.</description>
