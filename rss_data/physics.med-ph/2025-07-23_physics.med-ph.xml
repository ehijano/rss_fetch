      <title>The Anatomy of Coronary Risk: How Artery Geometry Shapes Coronary Artery Disease through Blood Flow Haemodynamics -- Latest Methods, Insights and Clinical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite tremendous advances in cardiovascular medicine, significant opportunities remain to improve coronary artery disease (CAD) prevention and treatment strategies. The key limitation lies in the understanding of disease formation and progression mechanisms. The coronary anatomy plays an important role in local haemodynamics, governing endothelial health and, thus, pathophysiological responses. The significant variation of the coronary anatomy among patients, with significant trends across different populations, increases the complexity of understanding the details of disease progression. This review covers different aspects of the current status and understanding of the blood flow investigation in coronary arteries. We summarised the current knowledge of the haemodynamic effect of coronary anatomy and its evaluation and analysis methods. We discussed recent progress across medical imaging techniques and computational haemodynamic analysis. Based on the reviewed papers, we identified the persisting knowledge gaps and challenges in the field. We then elaborated on future directions and opportunities to increase understanding of the fundamental mechanism of CAD in individuals representative of large populations and how this may translate to the patient's bedside.</description>

      <title>From Fiber Tracts to Tumor Spread: Biophysical Modeling of Butterfly Glioma Growth Using Diffusion Tensor Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Butterfly tumors are a distinct class of gliomas that span the corpus callosum, producing a characteristic butterfly-shaped appearance on MRI. The distinctive growth pattern of these tumors highlights how white matter fibers and structural connectivity influence brain tumor cell migration. To investigate this relation, we applied biophysical tumor growth models to a large patient cohort, systematically comparing models that incorporate fiber tract information with those that do not. Our results demonstrate that including fiber orientation data significantly improves model accuracy, particularly for a subset of butterfly tumors. These findings highlight the critical role of white matter architecture in tumor spread and suggest that integrating fiber tract information can enhance the precision of radiotherapy target volume delineation.</description>

      <title>Harmonization in Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Survey of Acquisition, Image-level, and Feature-level Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern medical imaging technologies have greatly advanced neuroscience research and clinical diagnostics. However, imaging data collected across different scanners, acquisition protocols, or imaging sites often exhibit substantial heterogeneity, known as "batch effects" or "site effects". These non-biological sources of variability can obscure true biological signals, reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impair the generalizability of learning-based models across datasets. Image harmonization aims to eliminate or mitigate such site-related biases while preserving meaningful biological information, thereby improving data comparability and consistency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts, methodological advances, publicly available datasets, current challenges, and future directions in the field of medical image harmonization, with a focus on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We systematically cover the full imaging pipeline, and categorize harmonization approaches into prospective acquisition and reconstruction strategies, retrospective image-level and feature-level methods, and traveling-subject-based techniques. Rather than providing an exhaustive survey, we focus on representative methods, with particular emphasis on deep learning-based approaches. Finally, we summarize the major challenges that remain and outline promising avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Multi-Angle Rotational Actuation in a 0.8-mm-Thick Preload-Free Piezoelectric Micromotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro motors can be used in numerous fields like Micro medical testing and treatment. To achieve a smaller size, micro piezoelectric motors in laboratories often omit the outer casing, which can lead to functional defects such as rotation only in one fixed direction or the need for external weights (which are not counted within the motors volume) to increase preload. However, this significantly reduces the practical value of micro piezoelectric motors. This paper proposes a new driving principle for piezoelectric motors to design a micro piezoelectric motor that can rotate at a wide range of angles (e.g. up to 80)without increasing the motors casing and does not require external weights, with a stator thickness of only 0.8 mm. This motor has significant application potential in OCT endoscopes and thrombectomy grinding heads</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Modeling of the Anode Heel Effect in X-ray Beam Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To develop a machine learning-based framework for accurately modeling the anode heel effect in Monte Carlo simulations of X-ray imaging systems, enabling realistic beam intensity profiles with minimal experimental calibration. Multiple regression models were trained to predict spatial intensity variations along the anode-cathode axis using experimentally acquired weights derived from beam measurements across different tube potentials. These weights captured the asymmetry introduced by the anode heel effect. A systematic fine-tuning protocol was established to minimize the number of required measurements while preserving model accuracy. The models were implemented in the OpenGATE 10 and GGEMS Monte Carlo toolkits to evaluate their integration feasibility and predictive performance. Among the tested models, gradient boosting regression (GBR) delivered the highest accuracy, with prediction errors remaining below 5% across all energy levels. The optimized fine-tuning strategy required only six detector positions per energy level, reducing measurement effort by 65%. The maximum error introduced through this fine-tuning process remained below 2%. Dose actor comparisons within Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the GBR-based model closely replicated clinical beam profiles and significantly outperformed conventional symmetric beam models. This study presents a robust and generalizable method for incorporating the anode heel effect into Monte Carlo simulations using machine learning. By enabling accurate, energy-dependent beam modeling with limited calibration data, the approach enhances simulation realism for applications in clinical dosimetry, image quality assessment, and radiation protection.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Adaptive Treatment Planning in Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of a digital twin (DT) framework for fast online adaptive proton therapy planning in prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) boost represents a significant advancement in personalized radiotherapy. This framework integrates deep learning-based multi-atlas deformable image registration, daily patient anatomy updates via cone-beam CT (CBCT), and knowledge-based plan quality evaluation using the ProKnow scoring system to achieve clinical-equivalent plan quality with substantially reduced reoptimization times compared to traditional clinical workflows. Drawing on a database of 43 prior prostate SBRT cases, the DT framework predicts interfractional anatomical variations for new patients and pre-generates multiple probabilistic treatment plans. Upon acquiring daily CBCT, it enables rapid plan reoptimization, achieving an average reoptimization time of 5.5 [2.8, 8.2] minutes, compared to 19.8 [7.9, 31.7] minutes for clinical plans. The DT-based plans yielded a plan quality score of 157.2 [151.6, 162.8], surpassing or matching clinical plans, with superior dose coverage for the DIL (V100: 99.5%) and clinical target volume (CTV V100: 99.8%). Additionally, the framework minimized doses to organs at risk (OARs), achieving bladder V20.8Gy of 11.4 [7.2, 15.6] cc, rectum V23Gy of 0.7 [0.3, 1.1] cc, and urethra D10 of 90.9% [88.6%, 93.2%], aligning with clinical standards. By addressing interfractional variations efficiently, the DT framework enhances treatment precision, reduces OAR toxicity, and supports real-time adaptive radiotherapy. This transformative approach not only streamlines the planning process but also improves clinical outcomes, offering a scalable solution for prostate SBRT with DIL boost and paving the way for broader applications in adaptive proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Emerging Frameworks for Objective Task-based Evaluation of Quantitative Medical Imaging Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative imaging (QI) is demonstrating strong promise across multiple clinical applications. For clinical translation of QI methods, objective evaluation on clinically relevant tasks is essential. To address this need, multiple evaluation strategies are being developed. In this paper, based on previous literature, we outline four emerging frameworks to perform evaluation studies of QI methods. We first discuss the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) to evaluate QI methods. Next, we outline a no-gold-standard evaluation framework to clinically evaluate QI methods without ground truth. Third, a framework to evaluate QI methods for joint detection and quantification tasks is outlined. Finally, we outline a framework to evaluate QI methods that output multi-dimensional parameters, such as radiomic features. We review these frameworks, discussing their utilities and limitations. Further, we examine future research areas in evaluation of QI methods. Given the recent advancements in PET, including long axial field-of-view scanners and the development of artificial-intelligence algorithms, we present these frameworks in the context of PET.</description>

      <title>RAPID-Net: Accurate Pocket Identification for Binding-Site-Agnostic Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of druggable pockets and their features is essential for structure-based drug design and effective downstream docking. Here, we present RAPID-Net, a deep learning-based algorithm designed for the accurate prediction of binding pockets and seamless integration with docking pipelines. On the PoseBusters benchmark, RAPID-Net-guided AutoDock Vina achieves 54.9% of Top-1 poses with RMSD &lt; 2 A and satisfying the PoseBusters chemical-validity criterion, compared to 49.1% for DiffBindFR. On the most challenging time split of PoseBusters aiming to assess generalization ability (structures submitted after September 30, 2021), RAPID-Net-guided AutoDock Vina achieves 53.1% of Top-1 poses with RMSD &lt; 2 A and PB-valid, versus 59.5% for AlphaFold 3. Notably, in 92.2% of cases, RAPID-Net-guided Vina samples at least one pose with RMSD &lt; 2 A (regardless of its rank), indicating that pose ranking, rather than sampling, is the primary accuracy bottleneck. The lightweight inference, scalability, and competitive accuracy of RAPID-Net position it as a viable option for large-scale virtual screening campaigns. Across diverse benchmark datasets, RAPID-Net outperforms other pocket prediction tools, including PUResNet and Kalasanty, in both docking accuracy and pocket-ligand intersection rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of RAPID-Net to accelerate the development of novel therapeutics by highlighting its performance on pharmacologically relevant targets. RAPID-Net accurately identifies distal functional sites, offering new opportunities for allosteric inhibitor design. In the case of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, RAPID-Net uncovers a wider array of potential binding pockets than existing predictors, which typically annotate only the orthosteric pocket and overlook secondary cavities.</description>
