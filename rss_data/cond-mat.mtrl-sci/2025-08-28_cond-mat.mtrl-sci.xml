      <title>Quantification of mobile ions in perovskite solar cells with thermally activated ion current measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile ions play a key role in the degradation of perovskite solar cells, making their quantification essential for enhancing device stability. Various electrical measurements have been applied to characterize mobile ions. However, discerning between different ionic migration processes can be difficult. Furthermore, multiple measurements at different temperatures are usually required to probe different ions and their activation energies. Here, we demonstrate a new characterization technique based on measuring the thermally activated ion current (TAIC) of perovskite solar cells. The method reveals density, diffusion coefficient, and activation energy of mobile ions within a single temperature sweep and offers an intuitive way to distinguish mobile ion species. We apply the TAIC technique to quantify mobile ions of MAPbI3 and triple-cation perovskite solar cells. We find a higher activation energy and a lower diffusion coefficient in the triple-cation devices. TAIC measurements are a simple yet powerful tool to better understand ion migration in perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Accurate calculation of light rare-earth magnetic anisotropy with density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) has long struggled to treat light rare-earth magnetism. We show that this difficulty arises from an overestimate of the $4f$ charge asphericity, and thus the magnetic anisotropy energy, due to the inadequacy of single Slater-determinant representations. We propose an effective solution by combining constrained DFT+U with crystal field theory and a systematic many-body correction to the charge asphericity. We confirm the validity of this combination on TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and TbCo$_5$, and then show how the many-body correction adjusts the calculated magnetic anisotropy energy of SmCo$_5$ to match experiment. Our method is an efficient DFT-based approach to address light-rare-earth magnetism.</description>

      <title>Band gap formation theory: An alternative to the Bragg diffraction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The band gap, a key concept in solid-state physics, is traditionally explained by the Bragg diffraction of electron waves in the periodic potential of a crystal. Although widely accepted, this framework raises fundamental issues in one-dimensional systems, where Bragg diffraction-which requires multidirectional wave interactions-reduces to simple interference, thus failing to explain band gap formation. In this paper, we introduce an alternative theory that does not rely on Bragg reflection. Using the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for Bloch waves, we consider the crystal lattice as a discrete set of observation points. This discreteness introduces a sampling-like constraint analogous to the Nyquist frequency in signal processing. We show that when the electron wavenumber changes under a periodic potential while the lattice spacing remains fixed, a band gap naturally emerges as a sampling effect. By constructing an energy diagram that incorporates this effect, we reveal that the band gap originates from both the wavenumber change and the role of the lattice as discrete samplers, leading the energy curve to exhibit translational and mirror symmetries with respect to the Nyquist wavenumber. This approach provides a novel, physically grounded explanation of band gap formation and can be naturally extended to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Giant Anomalous Hall Conductivity and Gilbert Damping in Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Half-Heusler Alloys PtMnBi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-Heusler alloys have emerged as promising candidates for novel spintronic applications due to their exceptional properties including the high Curie temperature (TC) above room temperature and large anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this work, we systematically study the magnetic and electronic properties of PtMnBi in {\alpha}-, \{beta}-, and {\gamma}-phase using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The three phases are found to be ferromagnetic metals. In particular, the {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi shows a high TC up to 802 K and a relatively large Gilbert damping of 0.085. Additionally, the {\gamma}-phase PtMnBi possesses a non-negligible AHC, reaching 203 {\Omega}-1cm-1 at the Fermi level. To evaluate its potential in nanoscale devices, we further investigate the {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films. The Gilbert dampings of {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films varies with film thickness and we attribute this variation to the distinct band structures at the high-symmetry point {\Gamma}, which arise from differences in film thickness. Moreover, the 1-layer (1L) {\alpha}-phase thin film retains robust ferromagnetism (TC = 688 K) and shows enhanced Gilbert damping (0.14) and AHC (1116 {\Omega}-1cm-1) compared to the bulk. Intriguingly, under a 2% in-plane biaxial compressive strain, the Gilbert damping of 1L {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin film increases to 0.17 and the AHC reaches 2386 {\Omega}-1cm-1. The coexistence of giant Gilbert damping and large AHC makes {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi a compelling platform for practical spintronic applications, and highlights the potential of half-Heusler alloys in spintronic device design.</description>

      <title>Multi-value Probabilistic Computing with current-controlled Skyrmion Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic systems are highly promising for implementing probabilistic computing paradigms because of the fitting energy scales and conspicuous non-linearities. While conventional binary probabilistic computing has been realized, implementing more advantageous multi-value probabilistic computing (MPC) remains a challenge. Here, we report the realization of MPC by leveraging the thermally activated diffusion of magnetic skyrmions through an effectively non-flat energy landscape defined by a discrete number of pinning sites. The time-averaged spatial distribution of the diffusing skyrmions directly realizes a discrete probability distribution, which is tunable by current-generated spin-orbit torques, and can be quantified by non-perturbative electrical measurements. Even a very straightforward implementation with global tuning, already allows us to demonstrate the softmax computation - a core function in artificial intelligence. As a key advance, we demonstrate invertible logic without the need to create a network of probabilistic devices, offering major scalability advantages. Our proof of concept can be generalized to multiple skyrmions and can accommodate multiple locally tunable inputs and outputs using magnetic tunnel junctions, potentially enabling the representation of highly complex distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Atomistic insights into hydrogen migration in IGZO from machine-learning interatomic potential: linking atomic diffusion to device performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding hydrogen diffusion is critical for improving the reliability and performance of oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs), where hydrogen plays a key role in carrier modulation and bias instability. In this work, we investigate hydrogen diffusion in amorphous IGZO ($a$-IGZO) and $c$-axis aligned crystalline IGZO (CAAC-IGZO) using machine learning interatomic potential molecular dynamics (MLIP-MD) simulations. We construct accurate phase-specific MLIPs by fine-tuning SevenNet-0, a universal pretrained MLIP, and validate the models against a comprehensive dataset covering hydrogen-related configurations and diffusion environments. Hydrogen diffusivity is evaluated over 650--1700 K, revealing enhanced mobility above 750 K in $a$-IGZO due to the glassy matrix, while diffusion at lower temperatures is constrained by the rigid network. Arrhenius extrapolation of the diffusivity indicates that hydrogen in $a$-IGZO can reach the channel/insulator interface within $10^{4}$ seconds at 300--400 K, likely contributing to negative bias stress-induced device degradation. Trajectory analysis reveals that long-range diffusion in $a$-IGZO is enabled by a combination of hydrogen hopping and flipping mechanisms. In CAAC-IGZO, hydrogen exhibits high in-plane diffusivity but severely restricted out-of-plane transport due to a high energy barrier along the $c$-axis. This limited vertical diffusion in CAAC-IGZO suggests minimal impact on bias instability. This work bridges the atomic-level hydrogen transport mechanism and device-level performance in oxide TFTs by leveraging large-scale MLIP-MD simulations.</description>

      <title>MnBr$_2$ on the graphene on Ir(110) substrate: growth, structure, and super-moir\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-layer MnBr$_2$ is grown on graphene (Gr) supported by Ir(110) and investigated using low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and spectroscopy. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the substrate are systematically characterized. The growth morphology strongly depends on the growth temperature, evolving from fractal to dendritic and eventually to compact dendritic skeletal islands, reflecting changes in the underlying surface diffusion processes. MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(110) constitutes a three-lattice system, giving rise to a super-moir\'e pattern --a moir\'e of moir\'es. Due to the involvement of lattices of differing symmetries and the partial electronic transparency of Gr, a "virtual" moir\'e formed by MnBr$_2$ and Ir(110) contributes to the super-moir\'e formation. Ab initio calculations play a crucial role in understanding the complexity of super-moir\'e. Moreover, the pronounced variation in the apparent height with tunneling conditions for the magnetic insulator is explained based on the measured electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Kinetic pathways of coesite densification from metadynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compression of coesite to pressures above 35 GPa, substantially beyond the equilibrium transition pressure to octahedral phases (8 GPa to stishovite). Experiments at room temperature showed that up to 30 GPa the metastable coesite structure develops only minor displacive changes (coesite-II and coesite-III) while the Si atoms remain 4-coordinated. Beyond 30 GPa, reconstructive transformations start, following different pathways from the complex structure of coesite. Besides amorphization, two different crystalline outcomes were observed. One is formation of defective high-pressure octahedral phases (Hu et al., 2015) and another one is formation of unusual and complex dense phases coesite-IV and coesite-V with Si atoms in 4-fold, 5-fold and 6-fold coordination (Bykova et al., 2018). Capturing these structural transformations computationally represents a challenge. Here we show that employing metadynamics with Si-O coordination number and volume as generic collective variables in combination with a machine-learning based ACE potential (Erhard et al., 2024), one naturally observes all three mentioned pathways, resulting in the phases observed experimentally. We describe the atomistic mechanisms along the transformation pathways. While the pathway to coesite-IV is simpler, the transformation to octahedral phases involves two steps: first, a hcp sublattice of O atoms is formed where Si atoms occupy octahedral positions but the octahedra chains do not form a regular pattern. In the second step, the Si atoms order and the chains develop a more regular arrangement. We predict that the pathway to coesite-IV is preferred at room temperature, while at 600 K the formation of octahedral phases is more likely.</description>

      <title>Emissive perovskite quantum wires in robust nanocontainers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light emissive nanostructures were prepared from boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) filled with inorganic lead halide perovskites. BNNTs provide a platform for facile synthesis of high aspect ratio perovskite quantum wires having color-tunable, highly polarized emission. BNNTs form a flexible and robust protective shell around individual nanowires, that mitigate degradation during post-processing for practical applications, while allowing to exploit the emission of the perovskite nanowires due to its optical transparency. The wire diameter can be tuned by choosing appropriate BNNT hosts, giving easy access to the strongly quantum confined diameter range. The individual encapsulated quantum wires can be used as building blocks for nanoscale photonic devices, and to create large-scale flexible assemblies.</description>

      <title>Microscale optoelectronic reservoir networks of halide perovskite for in-sensor computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing is a promising framework for efficient neuromorphic in and near-sensor computing applications. Here, we demonstrate a multimodal optoelectronic reservoir network based on halide perovskite semiconductor devices, capable of processing both voltage and light inputs. The devices consist of micrometer-sized, asymmetric crossbars covered with a MAPbI3 perovskite film. In a network, we simulate the performance by transforming MNIST images and videos based on the NMNIST dataset using 4-bit inputs and training linear readout layers for classification. We demonstrate multimodal networks capable of processing both voltage and light inputs, reaching mean accuracies up to 95.3 p/m 0.1% and 87.8 p/m 0.1% for image and video classification, respectively. We observed only minor deterioration due to measurement noise. The networks significantly outperformed linear classifier references, by 3.1% for images and 14.6% for video. We show that longer retention times benefit classification accuracy for single-mode networks, and give guidelines for choosing optimal experimental parameters. Moreover, the microscale device architecture lends itself well to further downscaling in high-density sensor arrays, making the devices ideal for efficient in-sensor computing.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale mechanics and ultralow Friction of natural 2D silicates: Biotite and Rhodonite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) silicates have emerged as a promising class of ultrathin materials, expanding the landscape of 2D systems beyond conventional van der Waals crystals. Their unique crystal chemistries and structural anisotropies make them attractive for applications ranging from sensors and flexoelectric devices to drug delivery and catalysis. To unlock their full potential, it is critical to understand their thickness-dependent mechanical properties within the family of 2D silicates. In this study, we investigate the nanomechanical and frictional behaviors of two structurally distinct natural silicates: layered Biotite and chain-structured Rhodonite. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we found that Rhodonite exhibits nearly ten times higher adhesion force and modulus response compared to Biotite. Despite this, Biotite demonstrates superior frictional performance, with ultrathin (5 nm) flakes showing a remarkably low coefficient of friction ($\sim 0.6 \times 10^{-3}$) versus Rhodonite ($\sim 3.6 \times 10^{-3}$). To further elucidate interlayer adhesion, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Hubbard correction were employed. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and selection of 2D silicates for advanced mechanical and tribological applications.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Doping Effects on Altermagnetism in MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Governed by specific symmetries, altermagnetism is an emerging field in condensed matter physics, characterized by unique spin-splitting of the bands in the momentum space co-existing with the compensated magnetization as in antiferromagnets. As crystals can have tailored and unintended defects, it is important to gain insights on how altermagnets are affected by the defects-driven symmetry-breaking which, in turn, can build promising perspectives on potential applications. In this study, considering the widely investigated MnTe as a prototype altermagnet, defects are introduced through substitutional doping to create a large configuration space of spin space groups. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, symmetry analysis, and model studies in this configuration space, we demonstrate the generic presence of spin-split of the antiferromagnetic bands in the momentum space. This is indicative of a wider class of quasi-altermagnetic materials, augmenting the set of ideal altermagnetic systems. Furthermore, we show that while pristine MnTe does not show anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) with out-of-plane magnetization, suitable doping can be carried out to obtain finite and varied AHC. Our predictions of quasi-altermagnetism and doping driven tailored AHC have the potential to open up as-yet-unexplored directions in this developing field.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian edge burst of sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts in Hermitian systems. A well-known example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non-Hermitian lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary-localized loss probability-a phenomenon that requires not only non-Hermitian band topology but also the closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the non-Hermitian edge burst in a classical-wave metamaterial: a lossy nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non-Hermitian band topology; the latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non-Hermitian band topology and other physical properties in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: Enhancing the fracture toughness of diamond while preserving its hardness is a significant challenge. Traditional toughening strategies have primarily focused on modulating the internal microstructural units of diamonds, including adjustments to stacking sequences, faults, nanotwinning, and the incorporation of amorphous phases, collectively referred to as intrinsic toughening. Here, we introduce an extrinsic toughening strategy to develop an unparalleled tough diamond composite with complex and abundant sp2-sp3 bonding interfaces, by incorporating highly dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the gaps of diamond grains to create a three-dimensional (3D) continuous MWCTNs network-toughen heterogeneous structure. The resultant composite exhibits a hardness of approximately 91.6 GPa and a fracture toughness of roughly 36.4 MPa.m1/2, which is six times higher than that of synthetic diamond and even surpasses that of tungsten alloys, surpassing the benefits achievable through intrinsic toughening alone. The remarkable toughening behavior can be attributed to the formation of numerous mixed sp2-sp3 bonding interactions at the 3D continuous network MWCNTs/diamond interfaces, which facilitate efficient energy dissipation. Our 3D continuous network heterogeneous structure design provides an effective approach for enhancing the fracture toughness of superhard materials, offering a new paradigm for the advanced composite ceramics.</description>

      <title>The Binding Energies of Atoms on Amorphous Silicate Dust: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust particles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for the chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding energies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies, and Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the binding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local minima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found for each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8 eV) &gt; Al (12.8 eV) &gt; Ca (12.7 eV) &gt; C (9.5 eV) &gt; O (8.1 eV) &gt; N (6.2 eV) &gt; Fe (6.0 eV) &gt; S (5.2 eV) &gt; Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding energies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a log-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have large binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust particles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N, O, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding energies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated with dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM), suggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We estimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to 3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime. These binding energies on silicate dust grains, estimated from first principles for the first time, provide invaluable input to models of dust evolution and dust-catalyzed chemical reactions in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Multiband Superconductivity and High Critical Current Density in Entropy Stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25</title>

Abstract: High and medium-entropy superconductors with significant intrinsic disorder are a fascinating class of superconductors. Their combination of robust structural integrity, superior mechanical properties, and exceptional irradiation tolerance makes them promising candidates for use in advanced superconducting technologies. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation on the superconductivity of equiatomic entropy-stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25. The material shows bulk superconductivity (transition temperature = 8K) with a high upper critical field of 11.94T. Interestingly, both the electronic band structure and specific heat data point toward unconventional multiband superconductivity. Our ab initio calculations reveal Dirac-like band crossings close to the Fermi level, with certain degeneracies persisting even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, suggesting a possible interplay between topological electronic states and the observed unconventional superconductivity. Remarkably, the critical current density exceeds the benchmark of 10^5 A/cm2, surpassing all previously reported as-cast entropy-stabilized superconductors. This high critical current density is likely attributed to strong flux pinning at the grain boundaries, facilitated by extreme intrinsic lattice distortion. Taken together, the demonstrated dynamical stability, excellent metallicity, potential to host unconventional superconductivity, and exceptionally high critical current density highlight the potential of entropy-stabilized alloys as a platform for exploring the confluence of disorder, topology, and unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect, which induces a transverse valley current via a second-order thermoelectric response to a longitudinal temperature gradient. The effect arises from the Berry connection polarizability dipole of valley electrons and is permissible in both inversion-symmetric and inversion-asymmetric materials. We demonstrate that the response tensor is connected to the intrinsic nonlinear valley Hall conductivity through a generalized Mott relation, with the two being directly proportional at low temperatures, scaled by the Lorenz number. We elucidate the symmetry constraints governing this effect and develop a theory for its nonlocal measurement, revealing a nonlocal second-harmonic signal with a distinct $\rho^2$ scaling. This signal comprises two scaling terms, with their ratio corresponding to the square of the thermopower normalized by the Lorenz number. Key characteristics are demonstrated using a tilted Dirac model and first-principles calculations on bilayer WTe$_2$. Possible extrinsic contributions and alternative experimental detection methods, e.g., by valley pumping and by nonreciprocal directional dichroism, are discussed. These findings underscore the significance of band quantum geometry on electron dynamics and establish a theoretical foundation for nonlinear valley caloritronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical manipulation of quantum matter offers a non-contact, high-precision and fast control. Fractional Chern ferromagnet states in moir\'e superlattices are promising for topological quantum computing, but an effective optical control protocol has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate robust optical switching of integer and fractional Chern ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 bilayers using circularly polarized light. Highly efficient optical manipulation of spin orientations in the topological ferromagnet regime is realized at zero field using a pump light power as low as 28 nanowatts per square micrometer. Utilizing this optically induced transition, we also demonstrate magnetic bistate cycling and spatially resolved writing of ferromagnetic domain walls. This work establishes a reliable and efficient optical control scheme for moir\'e Chern ferromagnets, paving the way for dissipationless spintronics and quantized Chern junction devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spin Accumulations Drive Magnetization Reversal in Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering and controlling heat and spin transport on the femtosecond time-scale in spintronic devices opens up new ways to manipulate magnetization with unprecedented speed. Yet the underlying reversal mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the challenges of probing ultrafast, non-equilibrium spin dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that typical magneto-optical experiments can be leveraged to access the time evolution of the spin accumulation generated within a magnetic multilayer following an ultrafast laser excitation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the final magnetic state of the free-layer in a spin-valve is mainly dictated by the ultrafast dynamics of the reference-layer magnetization. Our results disentangle magnetization and spin transport dynamics within a multilayer stack and identify demagnetization and remagnetization-driven spin accumulation as the key mechanism for all-optical switching. These findings establish new design principles for ultrafast spintronic devices based on tailored spin current engineering.</description>

      <title>Search for thermodynamically stable ambient-pressure superconducting hydrides in GNoME database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10 K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released and includes thousands of thermodynamically stable hydrides. To scan this large material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to obtain a reliable estimation of $T_{\rm c}$. Ultimately we have identified 22 cubic thermodynamically stable hydrides with $T_{\rm c}$ above 4.2 K and reach a maximum $T_{\rm c}$ of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential technological relevance.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</description>

Abstract: Myocardial infarction causes myocardium thinning, fibrosis, and progressive heart failure. Engineered human myocardium (EHM) is tested clinically as a first-in-class product for sustainable remuscularization in patients with advanced heart failure. Current EHM production procedure from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and stromal cells, is time consuming and involves thin constructs. Here, I introduce 4D-DLP-printed foldable scaffolds with potential to create modular cylindrical cardiac bricks. This enables self-assembly into thicker and aligned sarcomeres with synchronous contractility mimicking a native myocardium. When optimized and integrated with cryopreservation protocols, the biomanufacturing and biobanking of these cellular building blocks may overcome current EHM limitations and advance translational regenerative therapies for myocardial infarction. The structure-material properties investigations into these new class of life building blocks paves the way for future medical breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>Decoupling dynamics and crosslink stability in supramolecular hydrogels using associative exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of hydrogels that combine mechanical robustness with dynamic reconfigurability remains a fundamental challenge, as increasing crosslink dissociation rates compromise network integrity. This limitation is addressed through the incorporation of an associative crosslink exchange into DNA-based supramolecular hydrogels, enabling the decoupling of network relaxation behavior from crosslink stability. The hydrogels are constructed from enzyme-synthesized single-stranded DNA that self-assembles via hybridization between complementary domains. These crosslinks can reorganize through dissociative melting or associative strand displacement reaction, yielding networks with tunable relaxation timescales spanning over three orders of magnitude. Rheological measurements and thermodynamic modeling confirm that associative exchange facilitates efficient stress dissipation without diminishing rupture strength or thermal stability. In contrast, dissociative systems inherently trade increased dynamics with mechanical weakening. This decoupling is achieved through the implementation of a catalytic reorganization pathway governed by the composition of the sample, independently of crosslink strength. These findings establish the mechanism of reorganization as a key design parameter for engineering adaptive soft materials that combine resilience and responsiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd transport phenomena -- defined as a flux response orthogonal to an applied gradient -- have been recently observed in isotropic systems, with a multitude of proposed models and experiments to study these effects. Odd transport manifests in tensors that describe linear relations between fluxes and gradients that drive them, particularly when parity and time-reversal symmetries are broken. In this work, we identify such odd properties to be a subset of a broader class of major-symmetry-breaking behaviors, which we term ``anomalous." We develop a classification of anomalous properties described by $2^\mathrm{nd}$ and $4^\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in anisotropic 2D materials that maintain discrete rotational and reflection symmetries, characterized by the 17 wallpaper groups. To this end, we present representation theorems for these tensors, identifying which components are constrained for specific spatial symmetries and thereby allowing materials to be grouped into classes that exhibit anomalous responses or not. We focus our discussion on $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order tensors in the context of electrical resistivity and on $4^\mathrm{th}$ order tensors in the context of viscosity and elasticity. These findings are broadly applicable to the study of novel emergent material properties. To illustrate this, we discuss implications of our findings for two very different 2D materials that have recently garnered attention in condensed matter physics: knitted fabrics and twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a machine-learned interatomic potential for AlCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloys (HEA) using a diverse set of structures from density functional theory calculated including magnetic effects. The potential is based on the computationally efficient tabulated version of the Gaussian approximation potential method (tabGAP) and is a general-purpose model for molecular dynamics simulation of the HEA system, with additional emphasis on radiation damage effects. We use the potential to study key properties of AlCrCuFeNi HEAs at different compositions, focusing on the FCC/BCC phase stability. Monte Carlo swapping simulations are performed to understand the stability and segregation of the HEA and reveal clear FeCr and Cu segregation. Close to equiatomic composition, a transition from FCC to BCC is detected, following the valence electron concentration stability rule. Furthermore, we perform overlapping cascade simulations to investigate radiation damage production and tolerance. Different alloy compositions show significant differences in defect concentrations, and all alloy compositions show enrichment of some elements in or around defects. We find that, generally, a lower Al content corresponds to lower defect concentrations during irradiation. Furthermore, clear short-range ordering is observed as a consequence of continued irradiation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) is a many-body embedding method designed to describe condensed systems with correlated electrons localized within a given region of space, for example spin defects in semiconductors and insulators. Although the QDET approach has been successful in predicting the electronic properties of several point defects, several limitations of the method remain. In this work, we propose multiple advances to the QDET formalism. We derive a double-counting correction that consistently treats the frequency dependence of the screened Coulomb interaction, and we illustrate the effect of including unoccupied orbitals in the active space. In addition, we propose a method to describe hybridization effects between the active space and the environment, and we compare the results of several impurity solvers, providing further insights into improving the reliability and applicability of the method. We present results for defects in diamond and for molecular qubits, including a detailed comparison with experiments.</description>

Abstract: Surface contamination not only influences but in some cases even dominates the measured properties of two-dimensional materials. Although different cleaning methods are often used for contamination removal, commonly used spectroscopic cleanliness assessment methods can leave the level of achieved cleanliness ambiguous. Despite two decades of research on 2D materials, the true cleanliness of the used samples is often left open to interpretation. In this work, freestanding monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are annealed at different temperatures in a custom-built ultra-high vacuum heating chamber, connected to a scanning transmission electron microscope via a vacuum transfer line, enabling atomically resolved cleanliness characterization as a function of annealing temperature, while eliminating the introduction of airborne contamination during sample transport. While annealing at 200 {\deg}C already reduces contamination significantly, it is not until 400 {\deg}C or higher, where over 90% of the free-standing monolayer areas are atomically clean. At this point, further contamination removal is mainly limited by defects in the material and metal contamination introduced during the sample transfer or growth. The achieved large, atomically clean areas can then be used for further nanoscale engineering steps or device processing, facilitating interaction with the material rather than contamination.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enhanced by Synergetic Interactions among Photon Phonon and Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12262</link>

Abstract: Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and poor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate. The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation. Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2 stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced magnetism in fullerene monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon, charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the role played by electrons in the stress-strain curves of ideal crystalline solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of a solid, which relate its deformation to external applied forces, are key factors in enabling or disabling the use of an otherwise optimal material in any application, strongly influencing also its service lifetime. Intrinsic crystal deformation mechanisms, investigated experimentally on single crystals with low dislocation densities, have been studied theoretically through atomistic simulations, mainly focusing on lattice-induced instabilities. Here, instead, we employ density functional theory and a thermodynamic analysis to probe and analyze the way in which the electronic charge of crystalline solids (Cu, Al and diamond) responds to uniaxial strain and affects their mechanical properties. Indeed, despite the very simple nature of our models, and in the presence of minimal atomic displacements, we find that the stress strain curves of Cu and Al deviate from a simple linear elastic behavior. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the features of such curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order phase transitions, which originate from Van-Hove singularities of the electronic density of states crossing the Fermi level and electron redistribution within the solid, respectively.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effects across Berry-Dipole Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.</description>

      <title>Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.</description>

      <title>Influence of excitation energy on microscopic quantum pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient charge separation in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is crucial for optimizing light-harvesting and detection applications. However, precise control over the microscopic pathways governing ultrafast charge transfer remains an open challenge. These pathways are intrinsically linked to charge transfer states with strongly delocalized wave functions that appear at various momenta in the Brillouin zone. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) to investigate the possibility of steering carriers through specific charge transfer states in a prototypical WS2-graphene heterostructure. By selectively exciting electron-hole pairs at the K-point and close to the Q-point of WS2 with different pump photon energies, we find that charge separation is faster at higher excitation energies. We attribute this to distinct tunneling mechanisms dictated by the momentum where the initial excitation takes place. Our findings reveal that the microscopic pathways for ultrafast charge transfer in vdW heterostructures are highly sensitive to the excitation energy, an aspect that should be carefully considered when optimizing the performance of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aqueous cations permeate subnanoscale pores by crossing free energy barriers dominated by competing enthalpic contributions from transiently decreased ion-solvent and increased ion-pore electrostatic interactions. This commonly accepted view is rooted in the studies of monovalent cation transport. Divalent cations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring considerably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and subsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. Specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes.</description>

Abstract: Extracting the Hamiltonian parameters of nanoscale quantum magnets from experimental measurements is a significant challenge in quantum matter. Here we establish a machine learning strategy to extract the parameters of a spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows us to extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that predicts the Hamiltonian parameters of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable us to learn a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Altermagnetism Originated from Orbital Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) HfTe2 is a topological semimetal candidate with increasing attentions recently. The map of the Fermi surface is of interest and importance to understand its properties. Here we present a study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and planar Hall effect (PHE) in HfTe2. The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal.</description>
