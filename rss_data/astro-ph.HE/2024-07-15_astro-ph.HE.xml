      <title>Quantum Plasma Creation near a Magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars in quiescent states continue to emit hard X-rays with a power far exceeding the loss of rotational energy. It has recently been noted that this hard X-ray continuum may bear a direct signature of quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects in magnetic fields stronger than the Schwinger field ($B_{\rm Q} = 4.4\times 10^{13}$ G). When the current flowing into the magnetosphere is driven by narrow structures in the solid crust, the $e^\pm$ pair plasma supporting the current relaxes to a collisional and trans-relativistic state. The decay of a pair into two photons produces a broad, bremsstrahlung-like spectrum of hard X-rays, similar to that observed and extending up to $0.5-1$ MeV. The conversion of two gamma rays to a pair is further enhanced by a factor $\sim B/B_{\rm Q}$. Monte Carlo calculations of pair creation in a dipole magnetic field are presented. Non-local particle injection is found to be strong enough to suppress the high voltage that otherwise would accompany polar magnetic twist; the hard X-rays are mostly emitted away from the magnetic poles. Some of the pairs annihilate in an optically thin surface layer. The prototypical anomalous X-ray pulsar 1E 2259$+$586, which shows a hard X-ray continuum but relatively weak torque noise, slow spindown, and no radio emission, is a Rosetta Stone for understanding the magnetar circuit, consistent with the picture advanced here. For a $15-60$ keV luminosity as low as $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the polar flux of sub-relativistic pairs produces an optical depth $3-30$ to electron cyclotron scattering in the $1-10$ keV band, reducing the net X-ray polarization.</description>

      <title>TeV Analysis of a Source Rich Region with HAWC Observatory: Is HESS J1809-193 a Potential Hadronic PeVatron?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HESS J1809-193 is an unidentified TeV source, first detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Collaboration. The emission originates in a source-rich region that includes several Supernova Remnants (SNR) and Pulsars (PSR) including SNR G11.1+0.1, SNR G11.0-0.0, and the young radio pulsar J1809-1917. Originally classified as a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) candidate, recent studies show the peak of the TeV region overlapping with a system of molecular clouds. This resulted in the revision of the original leptonic scenario to look for alternate hadronic scenarios. Marked as a potential PeVatron candidate, this region has been studied extensively by H.E.S.S. due to its emission extending up-to several tens of TeV. In this work, we use 2398 days of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory to carry out a systematic source search for the HESS J1809-193 region. We were able to resolve emission detected as an extended component (modelled as a Symmetric Gaussian with a 1 $\sigma$ radius of 0.21 $^\circ$) with no clear cutoff at high energies and emitting photons up-to 210 TeV. We model the multi-wavelength observations for the region HESS J1809-193 using a time-dependent leptonic model and a lepto-hadronic model. Our model indicates that both scenarios could explain the observed data within the region of HESS J1809-193.</description>

      <title>GRB Progenitor Classification from Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt and Afterglow Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an established classification technique, we leverage standard observations and analyses to predict the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This technique, utilizing support vector machine (SVM) statistics, provides a more nuanced prediction than the previous two-component Gaussian mixture in duration of the prompt gamma-ray emission. Based on further covariance testing from \textit{Fermi}-GBM, \textit{Swift}-BAT, and \textit{Swift}-XRT data, we find that our classification based only on prompt emission properties gives perspective on the recent evidence that mergers and collapsars exist in both long and short GRB populations.</description>

      <title>Skipping a beat: discovery of persistent quasi-periodic oscillations associated with pulsed fraction drop of the spin signal in M51 ULX-7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of pulsations in (at least) six ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) has shown that neutron stars can accrete at (highly) super-Eddington rates, challenging the standard accretion theories. M51 ULX-7, with a spin signal of $P\simeq2.8$ s, is the pulsating ULX (PULX) with the shortest known orbital period ($P_\mathrm{orb}\simeq2$ d) and has been observed multiple times by XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR. We report on the timing and spectral analyses of three XMM-Newton observations of M51 ULX-7 performed between the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022, together with a timing re-analysis of XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR archival observations. We investigated the spin signal by applying accelerated search techniques and studied the power spectrum through the fast Fourier transform, looking for (a)periodic variability in the source flux. We analysed the energy spectra of the 2021-2022 observations and compared them to the older ones. We report the discovery of a recurrent, significant ($&gt;$3$\sigma$) broad complex at mHz frequencies in the power spectra of M51 ULX-7. We did not detect the spin signal, setting a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the pulsed fraction of $\lesssim10\%$ for the single observation. The complex is significantly detected also in five Chandra observations performed in 2012. M51 ULX-7 represents the second PULX for which we have a significant detection of mHz-QPOs at super-Eddington luminosities. These findings suggest that one should avoid using the observed QPO frequency to infer the mass of the accretor in a ULX. The absence of spin pulsations when the broad complex is detected suggests that the mechanism responsible for the aperiodic modulation also dampens the spin signal's pulsed fraction. If true, this represents an additional obstacle in the detection of new PULXs, suggesting an even larger occurrence of PULXs among ULXs.</description>

      <title>Clues on the nature of the quasi-periodic optical outbursts of the blazar OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fascination with the blazar OJ 287 stems not only from its status as a prominent candidate for a close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, but also because of the thermal bremsstrahlung origin proposed for its giant optical outbursts. These outbursts arrive as pairs, quasi-periodically every $\sim 12$ years, based on the unique 130-year-long, well-sampled optical light curve available for this blazar. For its three well-known, large quasi-periodic optical outbursts (QPOOs), observed in 1983, 2007 and 2015, optical photo-polarimetric monitoring has been reported in the literature. For these initially radio-undetected QPOOs, widely acclaimed as `bremsstrahlung flares', we have scrutinised the available measurements of optical polarisation and spectral index during the rising phase. Several inconsistencies of these data with the optical bremsstrahlung interpretation are noted, which point towards a synchrotron-dominated alternative interpretation for all these prominent QPOOs, just as for the optical emission observed between the outbursts. Possible reasons for the radio non-detection of the QPOOs during the initial stage are outlined.</description>

      <title>Rates of Stellar Tidal Disruption Events Around Intermediate-Mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09339v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rates of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been extensively calculated using the loss cone theory, while theoretical work on TDE rates around intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) has been lacking. In this work, we aim to accurately calculate the IMBH TDE rates based on their black hole masses and the stellar profiles of their host galaxies obtained from the latest observations. We find that IMBH TDEs from the center of small galaxies have an overall rate comparable to SMBH TDEs, while off-nuclei IMBH TDEs from globular clusters have a much lower rate. Very interestingly, we show that the rate of IMBH TDE per galaxy generally increases with the black hole mass, which is opposite to the trend seen in SMBH TDEs. Furthermore, we report that IMBH TDEs typically occur in the pinhole regime, which means that deeply plunging events are more likely for IMBH TDEs compared to SMBH TDEs. We also calculate the volumetric TDE rates for IMBH and SMBH TDEs and compare with observed rates.</description>

      <title>Investigating Optical Variability of the Blazar S5 0716+714 On Diverse Time-scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the observational study of the blazar S5 0716+716 in the optical bands B, V, R, and I between March 2019 and August 2023 to investigate its variability on diverse time-scales. The blazar was followed up by the T60 robotic telescope in Turkey for 416 nights to obtain long-term variability during this period. In order to search for intraday variability of the object, we have carried out 21 nights of observations with the T100 telescope for at least 1 hour. The blazar showed a ~2.47 mag variation in the optical R-band during our monitoring period, the brightest state on 18.01.2020 (MJD 58866) as R=12.109$\pm$0.011 and the faintest state on 23.03.2019 (MJD 58565) as R=14.580$\pm$0.013. We employed the nested ANOVA test and the power enhanced F-test to quantify intraday variability which showed that the blazar was significantly variable in the R-band on 12 out of 21 nights. Correlation analysis of the light curves shows that the emission in the BVRI optical bands was strongly correlated both in the short and long term without any time lag. The blazar has likely quasi-periods of 186$\pm$30, 532$\pm$76 days in the optical R-band light curve according to the WWZ, and the LS periodogram. The IDV and LTV features are discussed within the frame of prospective scenarios.</description>

      <title>Intensive broadband reverberation mapping of Fairall 9 with 1.8 years of daily Swift monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 1.8 years of near-daily Swift monitoring of the bright, strongly variable Type 1 AGN Fairall 9. Totaling 575 successful visits, this is the largest such campaign reported to date. Variations within the UV/optical are well-correlated, with longer wavelengths lagging shorter wavelengths in the direction predicted by thin disk/lamp-post models. The correlations are improved by detrending; subtracting a second-order polynomial fit to the UV/optical light curves to remove long-term trends that are not of interest to this study. Extensive testing indicates detrending with higher-order polynomials removes too much intrinsic variability signal on reverberation timescales. These data provide the clearest detection to date of interband lags within the UV, indicating that neither emission from a large disk nor diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region can independently explain the full observed lag spectrum. The observed X-ray flux variations are poorly correlated with those in the UV/optical. Further, subdivision of the data into four ~160 day light curves shows that the UV/optical lag spectrum is highly stable throughout the four periods, but the X-ray to UV lags are unstable, significantly changing magnitude and even direction from one period to the next. This indicates the X-ray to UV relationship is more complex than predicted by the simple reprocessing model often adopted for AGN. A bowl model (lamp-post irradiation and blackbody reprocessing on a disk with a steep rim) fit suggests the disk thickens at a distance (~10 lt-day) and temperature (~8000K) consistent with the inner edge of the BLR.</description>

      <title>Neutron-quark stars: Discerning viable alternatives for the higher-density part of the equation of state of compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By taking into account the latest observations and theoretical constraints, we investigate the merger and post-merger of binary neutron stars (NSs) with numerical simulations employing hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EOSs). We name our hybrid stars Neutron-quark stars (NQS), because the transition from hadrons to quarks starts at a density lower than the central density of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}$ stars. The two scenarios of transition to quark matter, a strong first-order phase transition (1PT) or a crossover, feature either a drop to almost zero or a rapid increase (peak) in the square of the sound speed $c_s^2$, implying a softening or stiffening during the transition, respectively. Although the properties of NQSs in equilibrium may not be distinguishable from those of NSs, we find that the post-merger gravitational-wave (GW) main frequency $f_2$ for the crossover scenario is generally lower than that of hadronic models with the same tidal deformability, indicating that a crossover transition is in principle observable when both the inspiral and post-merger signals are detected. Since it is viable according to current multi-messenger constraints, we also consider an EOS with a 1PT taking place at 1.8 times the nuclear saturation density ($n_0$), with a stiff quark EOS ($c_s^2 = 2/3~c^2$) after the transition. It is the first time that such a binary merger is studied numerically in full general relativity. Although its $f_2$ is $\sim 300$ Hz higher than that of its baseline, the relation between $f_2$ and the tidal deformability of inspiralling stars is close to that for hadronic EOSs.</description>

      <title>Dark matter limits from the tip of the red giant branch of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the quantum core: the ringdown of semiclassical stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This investigation delves into the ringdown signals produced by semiclassical stars, which are ultra-compact, regular solutions of the Einstein equations incorporating stress-energy contributions from quantum vacuum polarization. These stars exhibit an approximately Schwarzschild exterior and an interior composed of a constant-density classical fluid and a cloud of vacuum polarization. By adjusting their compactness and density, we can alter the internal structure of these stars without modifying the exterior. This adaptability enables us to examine the sensitivity of the ringdown signal to the innermost regions of the emitting object and to compare it with similar geometries that differ substantially only at the core. Our results indicate that echo signals are intrinsically linked to the presence of stable light rings and can be very sensitive to the internal structure of the emitting object. This point was previously overlooked, either due to the imposition of reflective boundary conditions at the stellar surface or due to the assumption of low curvature interior geometries. Specifically, for stellar-sized semiclassical stars, we find that the interior travel time is sufficiently prolonged to render the echoes effectively unobservable. These findings underscore the potential efficacy of ultra-compact objects as black hole mimickers and emphasize that any phenomenological constraints on such objects necessitate a detailed understanding of their specific properties and core structure.</description>

      <title>Neutron matter from local chiral EFT interactions at large cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron matter is an important many-body system that provides valuable constraints for the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. Neutron-matter calculations employing chiral effective field theory (EFT) interactions have been extensively used for this purpose. Among the various many-body methods, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods stand out due to their nonperturbative nature and the achievable precision. However, QMC methods require local interactions as input, which leads to the appearance of stronger regulator artifacts as compared to non-local interactions. To circumvent this, we employ large-cutoff interactions derived within chiral EFT (400 MeV $\leq \Lambda_c \leq$ 700 MeV) for studies of pure neutron matter. These interactions have been adjusted to nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts, the triton binding energy, as well as the triton beta-decay half life. We find that regulator artifacts significantly decrease with increasing cutoff, leading to a significant reduction of uncertainties in the neutron-matter EOS. We discuss implications for the symmetry energy and demonstrate how our new calculations lead to a reduction in the theoretical uncertainty of predicted neutron-star radii by up to 30% for low-mass stars.</description>

Abstract: We estimate the black hole spin parameter in GRS 1915+105 using the continuum-fitting method with revised mass and inclination constraints based on the very long baseline interferometric parallax measurement of the distance to this source. We fit Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations selected to be accretion disk-dominated spectral states as described in McClintock et al. (2006) and Middleton et al. (2006), which previously gave discrepant spin estimates with this method. We find that, using the new system parameters, the spin in both datasets increased, providing a best-fit spin of $a_*=0.86$ for the Middleton et al. data and a poor fit for the McClintock et al. dataset, which becomes pegged at the BHSPEC model limit of $a_*=0.99$. We explore the impact of the uncertainties in the system parameters, showing that the best-fit spin ranges from $a_*= 0.4$ to 0.99 for the Middleton et al. dataset and allows reasonable fits to the McClintock et al. dataset with near maximal spin for system distances greater than $\sim 10$ kpc. We discuss the uncertainties and implications of these estimates.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh and Raman scattering cross-sections and phase matrices of the ground-state hydrogen atom, and their astrophysical implications</title>

Abstract: We present explicit expressions for Rayleigh and Raman scattering cross-sections and phase matrices of the ground $1s$ state hydrogen atom based on the Kramers-Heisenberg dispersion formula. The Rayleigh scattering leaves the hydrogen atom in the ground-state while the Raman scattering leaves the hydrogen atom in either $ns$ ($n\geq2$; $s$-branch) or $nd$ ($n\geq3$; $d$-branch) excited state, and the Raman scattering converts incident ultraviolet (UV) photons around the Lyman resonance lines into optical-infrared (IR) photons. We show that this Raman wavelength conversion of incident flat UV continuum in dense hydrogen gas with a column density of $N_{\text{H}} &gt; 10^{21}~\text{cm}^{-2}$ can produce broad emission features centred at Balmer, Paschen, and higher-level lines, which would mimic Doppler-broadened hydrogen lines with the velocity width of $\gtrsim 1,000~\text{km}~\text{s}^{-1}$ that could be misinterpreted as signatures of Active Galactic Nuclei, supernovae, or fast stellar winds. We show that the phase matrix of the Rayleigh and Raman $s$-branch scatterings is identical to that of the Thomson scattering while the Raman $d$-branch scattering is more isotropic, thus the Paschen and higher-level Raman features are depolarized compared to the Balmer features due to the flux contribution from the Raman $d$-branch. We argue that observations of the line widths, line flux ratios, and linear polarization of multiple optical/IR hydrogen lines are crucial to discriminate between the Raman-scattered broad emission features and Doppler-broadened emission lines.</description>

      <title>Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton Accretion around the Rotating Hairy Horndeski Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16707</link>

Abstract: Modeling of the shock cone formed around a static, hairy Horndeski black hole with Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion has been conducted. We model the dynamical changes of the shock cone resulting from the interaction of matter with the Horndeski black hole. The effects of the scalar hair, the black hole rotation parameter, and the impacts of the asymptotic speed have been examined. As the absolute value of the hair parameter increases, the matter in the region of the shock cone is observed to move away from the black hole horizon. After h/M&lt;-0.6, a visible change in the physical structure of the shock cone occurs. On the other hand, it has been revealed that the asymptotic speed significantly affects the formation of the shock cone. As h/M increases in the negative direction and the asymptotic speed increases, the stagnation point moves closer to the black hole horizon. When the value of the hair parameter changes, the rest-mass density of the matter inside the cone decreases, whereas the opposite is observed with the asymptotic speed. Additionally, the formed shock cone has excited QPO modes. The deformation of the cone due to the hair parameter has led to a change or complete disappearance of the QPOs. Meanwhile, at asymptotic speeds of V_{\infty}/c&lt; 0.4, all fundamental frequency modes are formed, while at V_{\infty}/c=0.4, only the azimuthal mode is excited, and 1:2:3:4:... resonance conditions occur. No QPOs have formed at V_{\infty}/c = 0.6. The results obtained from numerical calculations have been compared with theoretical studies for M87*, and it has been observed that the possible values of h/M found in the numerical simulations are consistent with the theory. Additionally, the results have been compared with those for the GRS 1915+105 black hole, and the hair parameters corresponding to the observed frequencies have been determined.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Relativistic Jets from the Fast X-ray Transient 210423 using Prompt Radio Follow-Up Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07257</link>

Abstract: Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are a new observational class of phenomena with no clear physical origin. This is at least partially a consequence of limited multi-wavelength follow up of this class of transients in real time. Here we present deep optical ($g-$ and $i-$ band) photometry with Keck, and prompt radio observations with the VLA of FXT 210423 obtained at ${\delta t \approx 14-36}$ days since the X-ray trigger. We use these multi-band observations, combined with publicly available data sets, to constrain the presence and physical properties of on-axis and off-axis relativistic jets such as those that can be launched by neutron-star mergers and tidal disruption events, which are among the proposed theoretical scenarios of FXTs. Considering a wide range of possible redshifts $z\le3.5$, circumstellar medium (CSM) density $n={10^{-6}-10^{-1}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}}$, isotropic-equivalent jet kinetic energy $E_{k,iso}={10^{48}-10^{55}\,\rm{erg}}$, we find that we can rule out wide jets with opening angle ${\theta_{j}=15^{\circ}}$ viewed within ${10^{\circ}}$ off-axis. For more collimated jets (${\theta_{j}=3^{\circ}}$) we can only rule out on-axis (${\theta_{obs}=0^{\circ}}$) orientations. This study highlights the constraining power of prompt multi-wavelength observations of FXTs discovered in real time by current (e.g., Einstein Probe) and future facilities.</description>
