      <title>Generative diffusion model with inverse renormalization group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models represent a class of generative models that produce data by denoising a sample corrupted by white noise. Despite the success of diffusion models in computer vision, audio synthesis, and point cloud generation, so far they overlook inherent multiscale structures in data and have a slow generation process due to many iteration steps. In physics, the renormalization group offers a fundamental framework for linking different scales and giving an accurate coarse-grained model. Here we introduce a renormalization group-based diffusion model that leverages multiscale nature of data distributions for realizing a high-quality data generation. In the spirit of renormalization group procedures, we define a flow equation that progressively erases data information from fine-scale details to coarse-grained structures. Through reversing the renormalization group flows, our model is able to generate high-quality samples in a coarse-to-fine manner. We validate the versatility of the model through applications to protein structure prediction and image generation. Our model consistently outperforms conventional diffusion models across standard evaluation metrics, enhancing sample quality and/or accelerating sampling speed by an order of magnitude. The proposed method alleviates the need for data-dependent tuning of hyperparameters in the generative diffusion models, showing promise for systematically increasing sample efficiency based on the concept of the renormalization group.</description>

      <title>At low temperatures, glass-forming liquids relax in a simple way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glass-forming liquids have only a modest tendency to crystallize and hence their dynamics can be studied even below the melting temperature. The relaxation dynamics of most of these liquids shows at a temperature $T_c$, somewhat above the glass-transition temperature $T_g$, a crossover, which indicates the conjunction of two different dynamical regimes. For temperatures slightly above $T_c$, experiments and computer simulations have extensively probed this dynamics on the particle level and identified several universal scaling laws that are often compatible with theoretical predictions. Using large scale computer simulations we extend these studies to temperatures below $T_c$ and find that the relaxation mechanism is qualitatively different from the one found at higher temperatures. We identify new scaling laws that allow to give a simple description of the relaxation dynamics at very low $T$s. Specifically we reveal that the cage-escape process is related to rare but large particle displacements that give rise to a distinctive sub-diffusive power-law in the time correlation functions. This insight helps to advance our understanding on the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming systems at temperatures that are close to the experimental glass transition.</description>

      <title>From Weyl Anomaly to Defect Supersymmetric R\'enyi Entropy and Casimir Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a closed-form expression for the contribution of surface defects to the supersymmetric R\'enyi entropy in six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theories. Our results show that this defect contribution is a linear function of $1/n$ and is directly proportional to $2b-d_2$, where $b$ and $d_2$ are the surface defect Weyl anomaly coefficients. We also derive a closed-form expression for the defect contribution to the supersymmetric Casimir energy, which simplifies to $-d_2$ (up to a proportionality constant) in the chiral algebra limit.</description>

      <title>Aging of colloidal gels in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the aging of colloidal gels using light microscopy movies of depletion gels from the International Space Station. Under such microgravity conditions, we observe a slowdown in particle dynamics consistent with gel aging. Stronger attractive forces promote the formation of thicker gel strands over time. The samples are bidisperse, composed of particles with a size ratio 1.2. Larger particles experience stronger depletion forces, which lead to a large first-neighbor peak in the pair correlation function $g(r)$ due to the prevalence of large-large particle contacts. As the gel ages, small mobile particles are incorporated into the gel structure. The changes in gel structure correlate with a slow power-law decay in particle motion, observed over nearly two orders of magnitude of time scales in microgravity experiments. Additionally, through complementary ground-based experiments, we compare two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images of depletion colloidal gels. While microgravity gel data are limited to 2D projections, ground-based data establish a correspondence between the 2D and 3D $g(r)$ peak heights. Our results provide new insights into how colloidal gels age in the absence of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. When the existence probability of each edge follows a Bernoulli distribution, we rigorously prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models with appropriate parameterization coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results is a broad generalization of the result of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) with appropriate parameterization was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model).</description>

      <title>Quantum transport under oscillatory drive with disordered amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of non-interacting particles in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain in the presence of an electric field with random amplitude drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and explicitly focus on the nature of quantum transport. We derive an exact expression for the probability propagator and the mean-squared displacement in the clean limit and generalize it for the disordered case using the Liouville operator method. Our analysis reveals that in the presence a random static field, the system follows diffusive transport; however, an increase in the field strength causes a suppression in the transport and thus results in disorder-induced localization. We further extend the analysis for a time-dependent disordered electric field and show that the dynamics of mean-squared-displacement deviates from the parabolic path as the field strength increases, unlike the clean limit where ballistic transport occurs.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.</description>
