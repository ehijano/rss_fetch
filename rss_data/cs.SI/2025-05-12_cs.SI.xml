      <title>OpenSky Report 2025: Improving Crowdsourced Flight Trajectories with ADS-C Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The OpenSky Network has been collecting and providing crowdsourced air traffic surveillance data since 2013. The network has primarily focused on Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) data, which provides high-frequency position updates over terrestrial areas. However, the ADS-B signals are limited over oceans and remote regions, where ground-based receivers are scarce. To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract (ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air traffic management, environmental impact assessment, and aviation safety.</description>

      <title>Burger: Robust Graph Denoising-augmentation Fusion and Multi-semantic Modeling in Social Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Study of t , Peak and Effective Diameter in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how information, diseases, or influence spread across networks is a fundamental challenge in complex systems. While network diameter has been extensively studied in static networks, its definition and behavior in temporal networks remain underexplored due to their dynamic nature. In this study, we present a formal mathematical framework for analyzing diameter in temporal networks and introduce three time-aware metrics: Effective Diameter , Peak Diameter (*D), and t-Diameter (tD), each capturing distinct temporal aspects of connectivity and diffusion. Our approach combines theoretical analysis with empirical validation using four real-world datasets: high school, hospital, conference, and workplace contact networks. We simulate flow propagation on temporal networks and compare the observed diameters with the proposed theoretical Equations. Across all datasets, our model demonstrates high accuracy, with low RMSE and absolute error values. Furthermore, we observe that the effective diameter decreases with increasing average degree and increases with network size. The results also show that tD and *D are more sensitive to node removal, highlighting their relevance for applications such as epidemic modeling. By bridging formal modeling and empirical data, our framework offers new insights into the temporal dynamics of networked systems and provides tools for assessing robustness, controlling information spread, and optimizing interventions in time-sensitive environments.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness and Reducibility of Multiplex Networks with Embedding-Aided Interlayer Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of interlayer similarity of multiplex networks helps to understand the intrinsic structure of complex systems, revealing how changes in one layer can propagate and affect others, thus enabling broad implications for transportation, social, and biological systems. Existing algorithms that measure similarity between network layers typically encode only partial information, which limits their effectiveness in capturing the full complexity inherent in multiplex networks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel interlayer similarity measuring approach named Embedding Aided inTerlayer Similarity (EATSim). EATSim concurrently incorporates intralayer structural similarity and cross-layer anchor node alignment consistency, providing a more comprehensive framework for analyzing interconnected systems. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that EATSim effectively captures the underlying geometric similarities between interconnected networks, significantly improving the accuracy of interlayer similarity measurement. Moreover, EATSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in two downstream applications: predicting network robustness and network reducibility, showing its great potential in enhancing the understanding and management of complex systems.</description>

      <title>The Language of Influence: Sentiment, Emotion, and Hate Speech in State Sponsored Influence Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-sponsored influence operations (SIOs) on social media have become an instrumental tool for manipulating public opinion and spreading unverified information. This study analyzes the sentiment, emotion, and abusive speech in tweets circulated by influence campaigns originating from three distinct countries: China, Iran, and Russia. We examined 1.5 million tweets to uncover patterns in the content of the influence operations using the dataset provided by Twitter. Our findings reveal distinct patterns of sentiment, emotion, and abusive nature in different SIOs. Our experimental result shows that Russian influence operations predominantly employ negative sentiment and toxic language to polarize audiences, Iranian operations balance negative and positive tones to provoke hostility while fostering support, and Chinese campaigns focus on positive messaging to promote favorable narratives.</description>

      <title>Data Ethics in the Fediverse: Analyzing the Role of Instance Policies in Mastodon Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the disconnect between the individual policy documents of Mastodon instances--many of which explicitly prohibit data collection for research purposes--and the actual data handling practices observed in academic research involving Mastodon. We present a systematic analysis of 29 works that used Mastodon as a data source, revealing limited adherence to instance--level policies despite researchers' general awareness of their existence. Our findings underscore the need for broader discussion about ethical obligations in research on alternative, decentralized social media platforms.</description>

      <title>'Congratulations, morons': Dynamics of Toxicity and Interaction Polarization in the Covid Vaccination and Ukraine War Twitter Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of polarization and echo chambers has been noted in social media discussions of public concern such as the Covid-19 pandemic, foreign election interference, and regional conflicts. However, measuring polarization and assessing the manner in which polarization contributes to partisan behavior is not always possible to evaluate with static network or affect measurements. To address this, we conduct an analysis of two large Twitter datasets collected around Covid-19 vaccination and the Ukraine war to investigate polarization in terms of the evolution in influencer preferences and toxicity of post contents. By reducing retweet behavior in each sample to several key dimensions, we identify clusters that reflect ideological preferences, along with geographic or linguistic separation for some cases. By tracking the central retweet tendency of these clusters over time, we observe differences in the relative position of ideologically unaligned clusters compared to aligned ones, which we interpret as reflecting polarization dynamics in the information diffusion space. We then measure the toxicity of posts and test if toxicity in one cluster can be temporally dependent on its structural closeness to (or toxicity of) another. We find evidence of ideological opposition among clusters of users in both samples, and a temporal association between toxicity and structural divergence for at least two ideologically opposed clusters in our samples. These observations support the importance of analyzing polarization as a multifaceted dynamic phenomenon where polarization dynamics may also manifest in unexpected ways such as within a single ideological camp.</description>

      <title>AI Approaches to Qualitative and Quantitative News Analytics on NATO Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper considers the use of GPT models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for qualitative and quantitative analytics on NATO sentiments, NATO unity and NATO Article 5 trust opinion scores in different web sources: news sites found via Google Search API, Youtube videos with comments, and Reddit discussions. A RAG approach using GPT-4.1 model was applied to analyse news where NATO related topics were discussed. Two levels of RAG analytics were used: on the first level, the GPT model generates qualitative news summaries and quantitative opinion scores using zero-shot prompts; on the second level, the GPT model generates the summary of news summaries. Quantitative news opinion scores generated by the GPT model were analysed using Bayesian regression to get trend lines. The distributions found for the regression parameters make it possible to analyse an uncertainty in specified news opinion score trends. Obtained results show a downward trend for analysed scores of opinion related to NATO unity.
  This approach does not aim to conduct real political analysis; rather, it consider AI based approaches which can be used for further analytics
  as a part of a complex analytical approach. The obtained results demonstrate that the use of GPT models for news analysis can give informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.
  The dynamic model based on neural ordinary differential equations was considered for modelling public opinions. This approach makes it possible to analyse different scenarios for evolving public opinions.</description>

      <title>Utilizing LLMs to Investigate the Disputed Role of Evidence in Electronic Cigarette Health Policy Formation in Australia and the UK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Australia and the UK have developed contrasting approaches to the regulation of electronic cigarettes, with - broadly speaking - Australia adopting a relatively restrictive approach and the UK adopting a more permissive approach. Notably, these divergent policies were developed from the same broad evidence base. In this paper, to investigate differences in how the two jurisdictions manage and present evidence, we developed and evaluated a Large Language Model-based sentence classifier to perform automated analyses of electronic cigarette-related policy documents drawn from official Australian and UK legislative processes (109 documents in total). Specifically, we utilized GPT-4 to automatically classify sentences based on whether they contained claims that e-cigarettes were broadly helpful or harmful for public health. Our LLM-based classifier achieved an F-score of 0.9. Further, when applying the classifier to our entire sentence-level corpus, we found that Australian legislative documents show a much higher proportion of harmful statements, and a lower proportion of helpful statements compared to the expected values, with the opposite holding for the UK. In conclusion, this work utilized an LLM-based approach to provide evidence to support the contention that - drawing on the same evidence base - Australian ENDS-related policy documents emphasize the harms associated with ENDS products and UK policy documents emphasize the benefits. Further, our approach provides a starting point for using LLM-based methods to investigate the complex relationship between evidence and health policy formation.</description>

      <title>When cardinals strategize: An agent-based model of influence and ideology for the papal conclave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze two agent-based models to investigate the dynamics of papal conclaves, focusing on how social influence, strategic voting, and ideological alignment affect the time required to elect a pope. In the first model, cardinals interact through two mechanisms: with probability $p$, they imitate the choice of a randomly selected peer, and with probability $q$, they shift support to the most voted candidate from the previous round. Additionally, strategic behavior is introduced via ``useful voting'', where agents abandon their preferred candidate if he receives less than a certain fraction of the votes, switching instead to the most viable alternative. A candidate must secure a qualified majority of two-thirds to be elected. After that, we extend the framework by incorporating ideological blocs, assigning each cardinal and candidate to one of two groups (e.g., progressives and conservatives). Cardinals initially vote for candidates from their own group, but may cross ideological lines due to strategic considerations. We initialize the population with $20\%$ conservative cardinals, reflecting the current composition shaped by papal appointments. Numerical simulations show that ideological polarization can delay the election, increasing the average number of voting rounds. Our results highlight the crucial role of both strategic flexibility and ideological structure in collective decision-making under conditions found in papal conclaves. The recent rapid outcome of the 2025 conclave, despite a polarized electorate, suggests that informal consensus-building - possibly prior to voting - may play a decisive role in accelerating convergence, complementing the mechanisms explored in our model.</description>

      <title>Parallel Unconstrained Local Search for Partitioning Irregular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new refinement heuristics for the balanced graph partitioning problem that break with an age-old rule. Traditionally, local search only permits moves that keep the block sizes balanced (below a size constraint). In this work, we demonstrate that admitting large temporary balance violations drastically improves solution quality. The effects are particularly strong on irregular instances such as social networks. Designing efficient implementations of this general idea involves both careful selection of candidates for unconstrained moves as well as algorithms for rebalancing the solution later on. We explore a wide array of design choices to achieve this, in addition to our third goal of high parallel scalability. We present compelling experimental results, demonstrating that our parallel unconstrained local search techniques outperform the prior state of the art by a substantial margin. Compared with four state-of-the-art solvers, our new technique finds 75\% of the best solutions on irregular graphs. We achieve a 9.6\% improvement in edge cut over the next best competitor, while being only 7.7\% slower in the geometric mean.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Collective Creativity in Human-AI Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping modern culture, enabling individuals to create high-quality outputs across domains such as images, text, and music. However, we know little about the impact of generative AI on collective creativity. This study investigates how human-AI interactions shape collective creativity within experimental social networks. We conducted large-scale online experiments with 879 participants and AI agents in a creative writing task. Participants (either humans or AI) joined 5x5 grid-based networks, and were asked to iteratively select, modify, and share stories. Initially, AI-only networks showed greater creativity (rated by a separate group of 94 human raters) and diversity than human-only and human-AI networks. However, over time, hybrid human-AI networks became more diverse in their creations than AI-only networks. In part, this is because AI agents retained little from the original stories, while human-only networks preserved continuity. These findings highlight the value of experimental social networks in understanding human-AI hybrid societies.</description>

      <title>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least connected nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. As an application of the method, we present a scheme to detect multiple core-periphery structures and the decomposition of coarse-grained supernode networks, by combining the method with the network community detection.</description>
