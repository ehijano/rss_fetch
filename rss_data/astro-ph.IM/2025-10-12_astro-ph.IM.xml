      <title>Foundation Models for Astrobiology: Paper I -- Workshop and Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning over the past decade have resulted in a proliferation of algorithmic applications for encoding, characterizing, and acting on complex data that may contain many high dimensional features. Recently, the emergence of deep-learning models trained across very large datasets has created a new paradigm for machine learning in the form of Foundation Models. Foundation Models are programs trained on very large and broad datasets with an extensive number of parameters. Once built, these powerful, and flexible, models can be utilized in less resource-intensive ways to build many different, downstream applications that can integrate previously disparate, multimodal data. The development of these applications can be done rapidly and with a much lower demand for machine learning expertise. And the necessary infrastructure and models themselves are already being established within agencies such as NASA and ESA. At NASA this work is across several divisions of the Science Mission Directorate including the NASA Goddard and INDUS Large Language Models and the Prithvi Geospatial Foundation Model. And ESA initiatives to bring Foundation Models to Earth observations has led to the development of TerraMind. A workshop was held by the NASA Ames Research Center and the SETI Institute, in February 2025, to investigate the potential of Foundation Models for astrobiological research and to determine what steps would be needed to build and utilize such a model or models. This paper shares the findings and recommendations of that workshop, and describes clear near-term, and future opportunities in the development of a Foundation Model (or Models) for astrobiology applications. These applications would include a biosignature, or life characterization, task, a mission development and operations task, and a natural language task for integrating and supporting astrobiology research needs.</description>

      <title>Identification of molecular line emission using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) are observed to be abundant in various astrophysical environments, in particular toward star forming regions they are observed both toward protostellar envelopes as well as shocked regions. Emission spectrum especially of heavier COMs may consists of up to hundreds of lines, where line blending hinders the analysis. However, identifying the molecular composition of the gas leading to the observed millimeter spectra is the first step toward a quantitative analysis. We develop a new method based on supervised machine learning to recognize spectroscopic features of the rotational spectrum of molecules in the 3mm atmospheric transmission band for a list of species including COMs with the aim to obtain a detection probability. We used local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) modeling to build a large set of synthetic spectra of 20 molecular species including COMs with a range of physical conditions typical for star forming regions. We successfully designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that provides detection probabilities of individual species in the spectra. We demonstrate that the produced CNN-model has a robust performance to detect spectroscopic signatures from these species in synthetic spectra. We evaluate its ability to detect molecules according to the noise level, frequency coverage, and line-richness, and also test its performance for incomplete frequency coverage with high detection probabilities for the tested parameter space, and no false predictions. Ultimately, we apply the CNN-model to obtain predictions on observational data from the literature toward line-rich hot-core like sources, where detection probabilities remain reasonable with no false detection. We prove the use of CNNs facilitating the analysis of complex millimeter spectra both on synthetic spectra as well as first tests on observational data.</description>

      <title>deep-REMAP: Probabilistic Parameterization of Stellar Spectra Using Regularized Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP, a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to 732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format: moving from visualisation to scientific analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In the current era of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, international organisations are actively working on the definition of new standards for the publication of astronomical data, and substantial effort is devoted to make them available through public archives. Aims. We present a set of tools that allow user-friendly access and basic scientific analysis of observations in Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format, and we use them to gauge the quality of representative skymaps at ultraviolet, optical, and infrared wavelengths. Methods. We apply a fully-automatic procedure to derive aperture photometry in 10 different bands for the 323 nearby galaxies in the Herschel Reference Sample (HRS), and compare its results with the rigorous analyses involving specialised knowledge and human intervention carried out by the HRS team. Results. Our experiment shows that 9 of the 10 skymaps considered preserve the original quality of the data, and the photometric fluxes returned by our pipeline are consistent with the HRS measurements within a few per cent. In the case of Herschel PACS maps at 100 {\mu}m, we uncovered a systematic error that we ascribe to an inconsistent combination of data products with different spatial resolution. For the remaining skymaps, the estimated statistical uncertainties provide a realistic indication of the differences with respect to the HRS catalogue. Conclusions. In principle, the currently available HiPS skymaps in Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format allow to carry out broadband photometric analyses with an accuracy of the order of a few percent, but some level human intervention is still required. In addition to assessing data quality, we also propose a series of recommendations to realise the full potential of the HiPS format for the scientific analysis of large astronomical data sets.</description>

      <title>Understanding Exoplanet Habitability: A Bayesian ML Framework for Predicting Atmospheric Absorption Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of space technology in recent years, fueled by advancements in computing such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), has profoundly transformed our capacity to explore the cosmos. Missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have made information about distant objects more easily accessible, resulting in extensive amounts of valuable data. As part of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric absorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be based on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data generated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the climate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). In this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of simulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of the planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to identify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed to improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so that planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric absorption spectrum. This work is expected to contribute to a better understanding of exoplanetary properties and general exoplanet climates and habitability.</description>

      <title>Generalized Distributions of Host Dispersion Measures in the Fast Radio Burst Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As is well known, Hubble tension is one of the most serious challenges in cosmology to date. So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by using some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts (FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology proposed by Macquart {\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution functions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant $H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current ${\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\rm IGM}$ fairly close to its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for the parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a small $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a loose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125 localized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly preferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension between FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of modifying $\sigma_\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\rm DM_{IGM}$, here we try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\rm DM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\ell$ and $e^\mu$, respectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\rm DM_{host}$ are overwhelmingly strong.</description>

      <title>Deep uGMRT observations for enhanced calibration of 21 cm arrays -- I. First image and source catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-interferometric arrays require very precise calibration to detect the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal. A remarkably complete and accurate sky model is therefore needed in the patches of the sky used to perform the calibration. Instruments such as HERA, which use a redundant calibration strategy, also require a reference sky model to fix degenerate gain solutions. We have carried out a deep (20 hours) observation using the upgraded GMRT to make a high-fidelity sky model of one of the HERA calibration fields GLEAM 02H (J0200$-$3053). Here, we present the results from a $16.7\,\rm{MHz}$ bandwidth data centred at $147.4\,\rm{MHz}$. Using multiple GMRT pointings, we have made a $6.9^\circ\times6.9^\circ$ mosaic, which yields a median rms of $3.9^{+3.7}_{-1.4}\,{\rm mJy/beam}$ that reduces to $\sim2\,{\rm mJy/beam}$ at source-free regions. In the overlapping patch, this rms is deeper than the GLEAM catalogue, which is used for HERA calibration. We produce a catalogue of $640$ sources ($26\%$ extended) in the flux range $0.01-19.08\,{\rm Jy}$. The catalogue has a sub-arcsec positional accuracy, and the estimated fluxes are consistent with existing catalogues. The differential source counts are found to be deeper than GLEAM and consistent with LoTSS. Preliminary simulations of the sky models from GLEAM and our catalogue show $\sim 10-25\%$ difference in the visibility amplitude, with relatively small phase difference ($\approx 2^\circ$). Future work is planned for larger survey areas and wider bandwidth to reduce the rms and measure the in-band source spectral indices, which are expected to enhance the fidelity of the HERA calibration model.</description>

Abstract: Time series data and their time-frequency representation from gravitational-wave interferometers present multiple opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence methods associated with signal and image processing. Closely connected with this is the real-time aspect associated with gravitational-wave interferometers and the astrophysical observations they perform; the discovery potential of these instruments can be significantly enhanced when data processing can be achieved in O(1s) timescales. In this work, we introduce a novel signal and noise identification tool based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. For its application into gravitational waves, we will refer to it as GW-YOLO. This tool can provide scene identification capabilities and essential information regarding whether an observed transient is any combination of noise and signal. Additionally, it supplies detailed time-frequency coordinates of the detected objects in the form of pixel masks, an essential property that can be used to understand and characterize astrophysical sources, as well as instrumental noise. The simultaneous identification of noise and signal, combined with precise pixel-level localization, represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis. Our approach yields a 50\% detection efficiency for binary black hole signals at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 when such signals overlap with transient noise artifacts. When noise artifacts overlap with binary neutron star signals, our algorithm attains 50\% detection efficiency at an SNR of 30. This presents the first quantitative assessment of the ability to detect astrophysical events overlapping with realistic, instrument noise present in gravitational-wave interferometers.</description>

      <title>BGRem: A background noise remover for astronomical images based on a diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Astronomical imaging aims to maximize signal capture while minimizing noise. Enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio directly on detectors is difficult and expensive, leading to extensive research in advanced post-processing techniques.
  Aims: Removing background noise from images is a valuable pre-processing step catalog-building tasks. We introduce BGRem, a machine learning (ML) based tool to remove background noise from astronomical images.
  Methods: BGRem uses a diffusion-based model with an attention U-Net as backbone, trained on simulated images for optical and gamma ({\gamma})-ray data from the MeerLICHT and Fermi-LAT telescopes. In a supervised manner, BGRem learns to denoise astronomical images over several diffusion steps.
  Results: BGRem performance was compared with a widely used tool for cataloging astronomical sources, SourceExtractor (SExtractor). It was shown that the amount of true positive sources using SExtractor increased by about 7% for MeerLICHT data when BGRem was used as a pre-processing step. We also show the generalizability of BGRem by testing it with optical images from different telescopes and also on simulated {\gamma}-ray data representative of the Fermi-LAT telescope. We show that in both cases, BGRem improves the source detection efficiency.
  Conclusions: BGRem can improve the accuracy in source detection of traditional pixel-based methods by removing complex background noise. Using zero-shot approach, BGRem can generalize well to a wide range of optical images. The successful application of BGRem to simulated {\gamma}-ray images, alongside optical data, demonstrates its adaptability to distinct noise characteristics and observational domains. This cross-wavelength performance highlights its potential as a general-purpose background removal framework for multi-wavelength astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Generative modelling for mass-mapping with fast uncertainty quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark matter in the Universe is an important goal of modern cosmology. A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Notably, while alternative approaches for generating samples from a learned posterior are slow (e.g. requiring $\sim$10 GPU minutes per posterior sample), MMGAN can produce a high-quality convergence sample in less than a second.</description>

      <title>OL\'E -- Online Learning Emulation in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present OL\'E, a new online learning emulator for use in cosmological inference. The emulator relies on Gaussian Processes and Principal Component Analysis for efficient data compression and fast evaluation. Moreover, OL\'E features an automatic error estimation for optimal active sampling and online learning. All training data is computed on-the-fly, making the emulator applicable to any cosmological model or dataset. We illustrate the emulator's performance on an array of cosmological models and data sets, showing significant improvements in efficiency over similar emulators without degrading accuracy compared to standard theory codes. We find that OL\'E is able to considerably speed up the inference process, increasing the efficiency by a factor of $30-350$, including data acquisition and training. Typically the runtime of the likelihood code becomes the computational bottleneck. Furthermore, OL\'E emulators are differentiable; we demonstrate that, together with the differentiable likelihoods available in the $\texttt{candl}$ library, we can construct a gradient-based sampling method which yields an additional improvement factor of 4. OL\'E can be easily interfaced with the popular samplers $\texttt{MontePython}$ and $\texttt{Cobaya}$, and the Einstein-Boltzmann solvers $\texttt{CLASS}$ and $\texttt{CAMB}$. OL\'E is publicly available at https://github.com/svenguenther/OLE .</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of a Spacecraft Flyby with the Third Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS from Earth or Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of a spacecraft mission to conduct a flyby of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on July 1 2025, as it traverses the Solar System. There are both ready-to-launch spacecraft currently in storage on Earth, such as Janus, and spacecraft nearing the end of their missions at Mars. We calculate minimum $\Delta V$ single-impulse direct transfer trajectories to 3I/ATLAS both from Earth and from Mars. We consider launch dates spanning January 2025 through March 2026 to explore obtainable and hypothetical mission scenarios. Post-discovery Earth departures require a challenging $\Delta V\gtrsim24$ km s$^{-1}$ to fly by 3I/ATLAS. By contrast, Mars departures from July 2025 - September 2025 require $\Delta V\sim5$ km s$^{-1}$ to achieve an early October flyby -- which is more feasible with existing propulsion capabilities. \added{We further calculate the phase angle and flyby velocity for these trajectories, noting that the resulting flyby speeds would impose significant observational and engineering challenges that a mission would need to overcome.} We discuss how existing spacecraft could be used to observe 3I/ATLAS and how spacecraft at other locations in the Solar System could be repurposed to visit future interstellar objects on short notice.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>HWO Target Stars and Systems: A Prioritized Community List of Potential Stellar Targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The HWO Target Stars and Systems 2025 (TSS25) list is a community-developed catalog of potential stellar targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its survey to directly image Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. The TSS25 list categorizes potential HWO targets into priority tiers based on their likelihood to be surveyed and the necessity of obtaining observations of their stellar properties prior to the launch of the mission. This target list builds upon previous efforts to identify direct imaging targets and incorporates the results of multiple yield calculations assessing the science return of current design concepts for HWO. The TSS25 list identifies a sample of target stars that have a high probability to be observed by HWO (Tiers 1 and 2), independent of assumptions about the mission's final architecture. These stars should be the focus of community precursor science efforts in order to mitigate risks and maximize the science output of HWO. This target list is publicly available and is a living catalog that will be continually updated leading up to the mission.</description>
