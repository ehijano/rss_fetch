      <title>GRB 221009A: Observations with LST-1 of CTAO and implications for structured jets in long gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 221009A is the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date. Extensive observations of its afterglow emission across the electromagnetic spectrum were performed, providing the first strong evidence of a jet with a nontrivial angular structure in a long GRB. We carried out an extensive observation campaign in very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), starting on 2022 October 10, about one day after the burst. A dedicated analysis of the GRB 221009A data is performed to account for the different moonlight conditions under which data were recorded. We find an excess of gamma-like events with a statistical significance of 4.1$\sigma$ during the observations taken 1.33 days after the burst, followed by background-compatible results for the later days. The results are compared with various models of afterglows from structured jets that are consistent with the published multiwavelength data, but entail significant quantitative and qualitative differences in the VHE emission after one day. We disfavor models that imply VHE flux at one day considerably above $10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Our late-time VHE observations can help disentangle the degeneracy among the models and provide valuable new insight into the structure of GRB jets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the X-ray--radio connection for AGN via measurements of the multi-dimensional luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new methods to quantify the AGN population in terms of a multi-dimensional luminosity function that describes the space density of sources as a function of both X-ray and radio luminosity. We compile a sample of 1891 radio and X-ray detected extragalactic sources from the Bo\"otes and COSMOS fields. First, we investigate the X-ray--radio luminosity correlation in the sample and find that an apparent correlation is introduced due to the sensitivity limits of the surveys; when considering individual redshift bins we find a wide range of radio luminosities associated with a given X-ray luminosity, and vice versa, indicating little direct connection between the emission processes. We then measure the X-ray luminosity function, radio luminosity function and multi-dimensional X-ray--radio luminosity function across redshift ($0&lt;z&lt;6$). We apply luminosity thresholds in X-ray and radio to restrict our sample to those in the AGN-dominated regime and explore how the fraction of radio-selected AGN within the overall X-ray sample varies with increasing X-ray luminosity (and vice versa). We find that towards the highest X-ray and radio luminosities the fraction of sources with both an X-ray and radio detection increases towards 100%, indicating that at the highest luminosities we are more likely to obtain a detection in both bands, though the source will not necessarily be bright in both bands. Thus, the most luminous accretion events are more likely to be associated with the production of a jet, despite the distinct physical structures that produce the emission and likely persist over very different timescales.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified scheme of blazar evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs, including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score, combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar diversity beyond discrete classes.</description>

      <title>Radio Morphology of Gamma-ray Sources -- II. Giant Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant radio sources, including galaxies and quasars (hereafter GRGs), are active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting relativistic jets with source sizes exceeding the projected length of 0.7 Mpc. They are crucial to understanding the evolution of radio sources and their interaction with the surrounding environment. Some of these enigmatic objects, e.g., NGC 315, have also been reported as gamma-ray emitters. Since GRGs are thought to be aligned close to the plane of the sky, they are invaluable targets to explore the radiative mechanisms responsible for the observed gamma-ray emission. We have carried out a systematic search of gamma-ray emitting GRGs using sensitive low-resolution radio surveys, such as by Low Frequency Array, NRAO VLA Sky Survey, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, and considering the fourth data release of the fourth Fermi-Large Area Telescope gamma-ray source (4FGL-DR4) catalog. By carefully inspecting the radio maps of all AGN included in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, we have identified 16 gamma-ray emitting GRGs, including 8 of them being reported as GRGs for the first time. Some of their observed parameters, e.g., core dominance, appeared to differ from that found for the non-gamma-ray detected GRG population, possibly due to the relatively small viewing angle of the gamma-ray emitting jet. The observed gamma-ray properties of these objects were found to be similar to non-GRG gamma-ray emitting misaligned AGN. We conclude that the origin of the gamma-ray emission could be similar in both source populations.</description>

      <title>One dimensional analytical solutions of the transport equations for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive one dimensional (1D) analytical solutions for the transport equations of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence developed by Zank et al. [2012], Adhikari et al. [2023], including the Els\"asser energies and the correlation lengths. The solutions are suitable for an arbitrary given background convection speed and Alfv\'en speed profiles but require near equipartition of turbulent kinetic energy and magnetic field energy. These analytical solutions provide a simple tool to investigate the evolution of turbulence and resulting energetic particle diffusion coefficients in various space and astrophysical environments that possess simple geometry.</description>

      <title>Continued radio observations of the persistent radio source associated with FRB20190520B provides insights into its origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Follow-up studies of persistent emission from Fast Radio Burst (FRB) sources are critical for understanding their elusive emission mechanisms and the nature of their progenitors. This work presents new observations of the persistent radio source (PRS) associated with \ourfrb. We observe a gradual decay in the PRS brightness, which is punctuated by periods of brightening and dimming at both 1.5 GHz and 3 GHz. Furthermore, our low-frequency ($&lt;1$ GHz) observations-the first for this source-reveal evidence of a spectral break which can be attributed to absorption processes. Interpreted within the framework of the magnetar wind nebula model, our data constrain the age of the magnetar progenitor to $53^{+17}_{-10}$ years, broadly consistent with previous work. Assuming the observed 1.5 GHz variability is driven by scintillation, we derive a conservative lower limit for the source's radius of $&gt;0.52$ pc, for a screen at 10 kpc. The observations presented here challenge the predictions of the previously published best-fit hypernebula model for this source.</description>

      <title>Inferring the neutron star equation of state with nuclear-physics informed semiparametric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.</description>

      <title>Type Ia Supernova Progenitors and Surviving Companions within the Symbiotic Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symbiotic channel of Type Ia supernovae progenitors is crucial for explaining the observed circumstellar material in some Type Ia supernovae. While extensive numerical and observational efforts have been dedicated to exploring the progenitor system, limited emphasis has been placed on studying the surviving companions arising from the symbiotic channel. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the symbiotic systems using {\tt MESA} as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. We conduct 1260 binary stellar evolution simulations, over a wide range of parameters, incorporating the optically thick wind model developed by Hachisu et al., and predict the post-impact evolution of these surviving companions. We classify four types of progenitor systems based on the evolutionary stage of the companion at the onset of the explosion: red giant companions, with or without prior helium flash events, and asymptotic giant branch companions, with or without the thermal pulsing phase. After the SN impact, a blue dwarf star with either a helium or carbon-oxygen core is left behind. However, if a small portion of the envelope ($\gtrsim$ 0.3\%) remains on the core of the surviving companion, the overall post-supernova evolution may remain similar to its pre-explosion state, albeit slightly fainter, making observation a challenging endeavor.</description>

      <title>Observation and research on cosmic ray muons and solar modulation effect based on plastic scintillator detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays, originating from stars, supernovae, and other astrophysical sources, are composed of high-energy particles that enter Earths atmosphere. Upon interaction with atmospheric nuclei, these primary cosmic rays generate secondary particles, including neutrons, electrons, and muons, with muons constituting a dominant component at ground level. Muons, due to their relative abundance, stability, and well-characterized energy loss mechanisms, serve as critical probes for investigating the fundamental properties of cosmic rays. Studies of muon energy distribution, diurnal anisotropy, and their modulation by solar activity provide critical insights into the mechanism of particle acceleration in cosmic ray sources and the effects of solar and atmospheric.This study aims to characterize the counting spectra and anisotropic properties of cosmic ray muons by using a plastic scintillator detector system. The experiment was conducted over a three-month period, from December 2023 to February 2024, leveraging long-bar plastic scintillator detectors equipped with dual-end photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and a high-resolution digital data acquisition system. A dual-end coincidence measurement technique was used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing thermal noise and other background interferences. Diurnal variations in muon count rates exhibit a pronounced pattern, with a systematic reduction occurring between 8:00 AM and 1:00 PM. This phenomenon is attributed to the solar shielding effects, where enhanced solar activity during daytime hours modulates the flux of galactic cosmic rays reaching Earths surface. The study further corroborates these findings through cross-comparisons with data from the Yangbajing Cosmic Ray Observatory. These observations underscore the robustness of the plastic scintillator detector system for capturing detailed muon spectra and anisotropic patterns.</description>

      <title>A mechanism-independent methodology for modeling {\gamma}-ray phaseograms of pulsars in the framework of north-south symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermi-LAT observations revealed that each GeV phase-folded light-curve (aka. phaseogram) of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars consists of two pulses (P1 &amp; P2) and a "Bridge" between them. There is clearly a "bump" at the Bridge phase of Vela's pulse profiles, that could also be regarded as the third pulse (P3). Differently, the Crab's, Geminga's &amp; Dragonfly's bridges relatively resemble a "valley floor". Despite such an apparent difference, it is interesting to investigate whether their bridge emissions are still within the same general picture as Vela's. Assuming the north-south symmetry, we would expect the fourth component (Bridge2/P4) to exist as well. However, such a hypothetical Bridge2/P4 is not intuitively identified on $\gamma$-ray phaseograms of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars. It is also intriguing to hint at the rationale for the non-discovery of Bridge2/P4. Our prototypical toy model is free of assumptions on emission regions or radiation mechanisms. Instead, it assumes a north-south symmetric geometry and one circularly symmetric beam per hemisphere, while taking into account Doppler shifts (the most innovative element), time delays and energy-dependent beam shapes. Tentative compatibility of our fitting results with wind models is reported. Notably, for the Crab pulsar, we found a preliminary qualitative correlation between our model predictions and the IXPE results on X-ray polarisation. The softer $\gamma$-ray pulsation of the Geminga pulsar is found to span over its full phase. Prompted by systematic evaluations, we outline some potential improvements for our toy model.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Flares of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars: A statistical view</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a 10 years sample of gamma-ray flares of FSRQs collected with FERMI and AGILE, I report on this proceeding the advance on a statistical study of variability for a sample of more than 300 FSRQs. I will focus on waiting time between flares (defined as the time intervals between consecutive activity peaks (Pacciani 2022). The investigation revealed that gamma-ray activity can be modeled with overlapping bursts of flares, with flares uniformly distributed within each burst, and a typical burst rate of 0.6 y$^{-1}$. Moreover, a statistically relevant fast component with timescale of order of days is revealed. From these results, constraints on flares emission mechanisms were derived. I also discuss the preliminary results on an investigation of flares luminosity and duration in gamma-rays. A Simple fitting model is shown, correlating peak luminosity and duration of gamma-ray flares (paper in preparation).</description>

      <title>The physical properties of candidate neutrino-emitter blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The processes governing the production of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos are still debated, and the sources originating them remain an open question. Among the putative emitters, active galactic nuclei have gained increasing attention. Blazars, in particular, stand out due to their ability to accelerate particles in environments with external radiation fields. Recent observations suggest they may contribute to the neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We study the physical properties of a subsample of 52 blazars proposed as candidate neutrino emitters, based on a positional cross-correlation analysis between IceCube hotspots and the 5BZCat catalog. We aim to provide a first characterization of their central engines and physical nature, to explore the potential link with neutrino production. We analyze the optical spectroscopic properties of the 52 candidate neutrino-emitter blazars to infer their accretion regime. The study is complemented by radio and $\gamma$-ray data, which trace the intrinsic jet power. We compare the sample to other blazar populations in the literature, perform statistical tests, and explore, through simulations, the applicability of methods that include censored data. Overall, the target sample shows properties compatible with the reference samples. We observe a mild tendency to prefer objects with intense radiation fields, typical of radiatively efficient accretors, and high radio power. Among them, 24 are detected by Fermi-LAT, spanning various $\gamma$-ray luminosities. We also show that statistical tests commonly used in the literature need to be handled with caution, as they are sensitive to the number of censored data and the sample size.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Disc-Jet Coupling in Black Hole X-ray Binaries: On the Nature of Disc Dynamics and Jet Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive wide-band ($3-100$keV) spectro-temporal analysis of 13 outbursting BH-XRBs, using data (quasi)simultaneous with radio observations to unravel the complex disc-jet connection. RXTE observations are analyzed for XTEJ1859+226, GX339-4 (2002, 2006, and 2010 outbursts), 4U1543-47, H1743-322 (2003 and 2009 outbursts), XTEJ1550-564, XTEJ1752-223, XTEJ1650-500, SwiftJ1753.5-0127, XTEJ1748-288, and GROJ1655-40. For SwiftJ1727.8-1613 and MAXIJ1535-571, we utilize HXMT data, while both AstroSat and HXMT observations are analyzed for SwiftJ1658.2-4242. Type-C QPOs observed in harder states (LHS, HIMS; $F_{nth}\ge0.4$) exhibit positive lag for low-inclination sources ($i&lt;50^{\circ}$), whereas it generally exhibits negative lag for high-inclination sources ($i&gt;60^{\circ}$), except XTEJ1550-564, SwiftJ1727.8-1613, H1743-322 (2003 outburst) and GROJ1655-40. Notably, type-A QPOs exhibit negative lags ($\sim1-10$ms) regardless of source inclination, while type-B QPOs show positive lags in low-inclination sources, and both positive and negative lags ($\sim1-15$ms) in high-inclination sources, typically occurring in SIMS ($F_{nth}\lesssim0.45$). Systematic appearance of type-A QPOs preceding radio flares in several sources suggests that type-A QPOs indicate telltale signs of jet ejection, while type-B QPOs are closely linked with radio flares (i.e., transient jets). Present findings suggest the corona evolves from a radially extended to a vertically elongated structure during the type-C to type-B transition via type-A QPOs, with type-B QPOs linked to radially compact or vertically extended coronal geometries, resembling jet ejection. The strong radio-X-ray luminosity correlation seems to provide compelling evidence of accretion-powered jets. Finally, we find that jets in SIMS are moderately relativistic in nature with velocities $\gtrsim 0.3-0.8c$ in BH-XRBs under consideration.</description>

      <title>The interplay of emission geometry and extragalactic magnetic fields in the spectra of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins and acceleration mechanisms of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are unknown. Many models attribute their extreme energies to powerful astrophysical jets. Understanding whether jet geometry -- specifically the opening angle and its orientation relative to Earth -- affects observational signatures, is crucial for interpreting UHECR data. In this work, we perform numerical simulations of UHECR propagation in a magnetized universe to investigate the spectral signatures of jetted and non-jetted astrophysical sources. We demonstrate, for the first time, that under certain conditions, emission geometry can play a decisive role in shaping the observed spectrum of individual UHECR sources. These findings provide new insights into the conditions necessary for detecting UHECRs from jets, and highlight how the interplay between emission geometry and magnetic fields influences observed energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Twin peaks: SN 2021uvy and SN 2022hgk in the landscape of double-peaked stripped envelope supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a class of stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) showing two distinct light-curve peaks has emerged, where the first peak cannot be attributed to shock cooling emission. Such peculiar SNe are often studied individually, explained by a combination of powering mechanisms, but are rarely discussed broadly as a group. In this paper, we attempt to form a picture of the landscape of double-peaked SESNe and their powering mechanisms by adding two more objects -- SN 2021uvy and SN 2022hgk. SN 2021uvy is a broad, luminous SN Ib with an unusually long first peak rise and constant color evolution with rising photospheric temperature during the second peak. Though its first peak resembles SN 2019stc, their second peaks differ, making SN 2021uvy unique. SN 2022hgk shows photometric similarity to SN 2019cad and spectroscopic similarity to SN 2005bf, both proposed to be powered by a double-nickel distribution in their ejecta. We analyze their light curves and colors, compare them with a sample of double-peaked SESNe from the ZTF archive, and analyze the light curve parameters of the sample. We observe a correlation (p-value~0.025) between the peak absolute magnitudes of the first and second peaks. No single definitive powering mechanism applies to the whole sample, as it shows variety in the photometric and spectroscopic properties. However, sub-groups of similarity exist that can be explained by mechanisms like the double-nickel distribution, magnetar central engine, interaction, and fallback accretion. We also map out the duration between the peaks ($\Delta t^{21}$) vs the difference between peak absolute magnitudes ($\Delta M^{21}$) as a phase-space that could potentially delineate the most promising powering mechanisms for the double-peaked SESNe.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Multiwavelength Emission of 3C 279 during the 14 years of Fermi-LAT Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03913</link>

Abstract: We report the results of our long-term multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) study on the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 during the $\sim14$ years (2008--2022) of {\sl Fermi}-LAT (Large Area Telescope) observing period. The {\sl Fermi}-LAT data were complemented with data in other wavebands obtained from {\sl Swift}-XRT/UVOT, Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT), along with other optical and radio data from several observatories. Different activity states were identified from the weekly binned $\gamma$-ray light curve, and it was possible to create 168 high-quality and quasi-simultaneous broadband SEDs. We modeled the SEDs using a one-zone leptonic scenario, including the emission region outside the broad-line region (BLR), involving synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton, and external Compton mechanisms. Such extensive broadband modeling is essential for constraining the underlying multiwavelength radiative mechanisms in the 3C 279 jet and permits to estimate the physical parameters and explore their evolution in time. Our SED modeling study suggests that the increase in the Doppler beaming factor along with the variation of the emitting electrons is the cause for the flares in this source. The multiwavelength emission of 3C 279 was found to be well explained by the scenario in which the emission region is outside the BLR at a distance of $\sim6.42\times10^{3} R_S$. However, for two of the very bright $\gamma$-ray states, the emission region was found to be close to the outer boundary of the BLR at a distance of $\sim1.28\times10^{3} R_S$ from the central black hole.</description>

      <title>Transient QPOs of Fermi-LAT blazars under the Curved Jet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores transient quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the $\gamma$-ray emission of two blazars, PMN J0531$-$4827 and PKS 1502+106, using over a decade of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations. The analysis focuses on identifying QPO signatures in their long-term light curves and interpreting the variability through a curved jet model, which predicts multiplicative oscillations with exponentially decaying amplitudes. We develop an analysis methodology to characterize the QPO and the specific properties of the amplitude of such QPOs. The findings offer insights into the dynamic processes driving relativistic jet evolution and their potential connections to underlying mechanisms, such as binary systems or other phenomena influencing the observed characteristics of these blazars.</description>

      <title>Search for spatial coincidences between galaxy mergers and Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for spatial association between a high-confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers detected through SDSS imaging and the 4FGL-DR4 catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson-based statistical framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match probabilities $p &lt; 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters such as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger-driven processes can fuel high-energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN-like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy mergers, opening new avenues for understanding the role of interactions in high-energy astrophysics. We additionally examined the sample of 70 galaxy pairs from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and found no statistically significant matches, with $p &lt; 0.05$ within the 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold.</description>

      <title>A Search for Millimeter-Bright Blazars as Astrophysical Neutrino Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The powerful jets of blazars have been historically considered as likely sites of high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. However, particulars of the launched jet and the locations of leptonic and hadronic jet loading remain unclear. In the case when leptonic and hadronic particle injection occur jointly, a temporal correlation between synchrotron radiation and neutrino production is expected. We use a first catalog of millimeter (mm) wavelength blazar light curves from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope for a time-dependent correlation with twelve years of muon neutrino events from the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory. Such mm emission is known to trace activity of the bright jet base, which is often self-absorbed at lower frequencies and potentially gamma-ray opaque. We perform an analysis of the population, as well as analyses of individual, selected sources. We do not observe a significant signal from the stacked population. TXS 0506+056 is found as the most significant, individual source, though this detection is not globally significant in our analysis of selected AGN. Our results suggest that the majority of mm-bright blazars are neutrino dim. In general, it is possible that many blazars have lighter, leptonic jets, or that only selected blazars provide exceptional conditions for neutrino production.</description>

      <title>A systematic study of binary neutron star merger rate density history using simulated gravitational wave and short gamma-ray burst observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the merger rate density history of binary neutron stars (BNS) can greatly aid in understanding the history of heavy element formation in the Universe. Currently, second-generation Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors can only measure the BNS merger rate density history at low redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 0.1). Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) may trace the BNS merger to higher redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 3). However, not all BNS mergers result in sGRBs, and it is not certain that all sGRBs originate from BNS mergers. In this study, we simultaneously utilize simulated BNS merger GW signals detected by the advanced LIGO design and sGRB signals detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM to constrain the BNS merger rate density history up to $z$ $\sim$ 3. The results indicate that with $\sim$ 8 GWs and 571 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured with an accuracy of about 50\% through $z=0$ to $z=1$. The ratio of the jet opening angle-corrected sGRB event rate density to the BNS merger rate density, denoted as $\eta$, can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 45\%. With $\sim$ 21 GWs and 761 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured to approximately 35\% and 40\% at $z=0$ and $z=1$, respectively. Meanwhile, $\eta$ can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 28\%. Additionally, in our parameterized simulation, we find that at least approximately $\sim$550 sGRBs are needed to constrain the characteristic delay time in the star formation rate model, given a relative error of 50\% in the estimated redshift.</description>

      <title>Pulsar radio emission height as a function of phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical treatment of the pulsar radio emission height as a function of phase is presented. Based on previous works, assuming a dipole field geometry, the emission height can be expressed as a function of phase and the impact angle. We found that: (1) The emission height is a quadratic function of the phase, given the magnetospheric geometry. The emission height is higher at the edge of the pulse profile than at the center. (2) The emission height is also quadratic function of the impact angle. This point can be compared directly with the observations of the geodetic precessing pulsar PSR J1906+0745. (3) Larger inclination angle may imply a higher emission height, when other parameters are similar. (4) By assuming curvature radiation, or inverse Compton scattering, the Lorentz factor of the radio emitting particles can be obtained as a function of phase.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star-White Dwarf Merger as One Possible Optional Source of Kilonova-like Emission: Implications for GRB 211211A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-duration GRB 211211A, which lacked an associated supernova at such a low redshift $z=0.076$, but was associated with a possible kilonova emission, has attracted great attention. The neutron star-white dwarf (NS-WD) merger is proposed as a possible progenitor of GRB 211211A, and it could naturally explain the long duration of the prompt emission. However, the NS-WD merger is not an ideal site for producing heavy elements via r-process nucleosynthesis. In this Letter, we investigate the heavy elements produced in NS-WD mergers based on numerical simulations of nucleosynthesis via SkyNet, and then calculate the resulting kilonova-like emission to compare with the solidly observed case of possible kilonova emission associated with GRB 211211A. By adopting three models (i.e., Model-A, Model-B, and Model-C) from \cite{2023ApJ...956...71K} at different temperatures ($T=4$ GK, 5 GK, and 6 GK), which are treated as free parameters, we find that the mass number of the heaviest element produced in our simulations is less than 90 ($A&lt; 90$). Moreover, by comparing the calculated kilonova-like emission with the afterglow-subtracted observations of the possible kilonova associated with GRB 211211A, it is found that the merger of NS and WD cannot be ruled out as the origin of GRB 211211A to produce the possible kilonova emission if the remnant of the WD-NS merger is a supramassive or stable magnetar. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain the early possible kilonova emission following GRB 211211A by invoking the merger of a WD and an NS.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission of the Nuclear Stellar Disk as seen by SRG/ART-XC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD), together with the Nuclear Stellar Cluster and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, forms the central region of the Milky Way. Galactic X-ray background emission is known to be associated with the old stellar population, predominantly produced by accreting white dwarfs. In this work we characterize the X-ray emission of the Galactic Center (GC) region using wide-field observations with the ART-XC telescope on board the SRG observatory in the 4-12 keV energy band. Our analysis demonstrates that the X-ray emission of the GC at a spatial scale of a few hundred parsecs is dominated by the regularly shaped NSD aligned in the Galactic plane, and characterized by latitudinal and longitudinal scale heights of approximately 20 pc and approximately 100 pc, respectively. The measured flux, 6.8 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 4-12 keV band, corresponds to a luminosity of 5.9 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^36 erg/s, assuming the GC distance of 8.178 kpc. The average mass-normalized X-ray emissivity of the NSD, 5.6 (+0.5, -0.7) x 10^27 erg/s/M_sun, exceeds the corresponding value of the Galactic ridge by a factor of 3.3 (+0.4, -0.5), confirming other studies. We also perform a deprojection of the observed NSD surface brightness distribution in order to construct a three-dimensional X-ray luminosity density model, which can be directly compared to the existing three-dimensional stellar mass models. The emissivity of the NSD as a function of distance to Sgr A* reveals a centrally concentrated maximum, indicating an enhanced radiative output per unit stellar mass in the inner NSD region. Finally, we conclude that the observed spatial properties of the NSD are fully consistent with the stellar mass density distribution, leaving only a small room for a possible diffuse component.</description>

      <title>Resolving the origin of the unidentified TeV source HESS J1626-490 as a relic of the ancient cosmic-ray factory SNR G335.2+0.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While decades of observations in the TeV gamma-ray band have revealed more than 200~sources with radio or X-ray counterparts, there remain dozens of unidentified TeV sources, which may provide crucial information of cosmic ray (CR) accelerators. HESS J1626$-$490 is an unidentified TeV gamma-ray source but is expected to originate from CRs that escaped from the nearby supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and are interacting with dense interstellar clouds. To test this scenario, we scrutinize the properties of the SNR and search for non-thermal counterparts by analyzing observational data in the radio, X-ray, and GeV gamma-ray bands. From analysis of the H\,{\sc i} and $^{12}$CO ($J{=}1{-}0$) line data, we identify the cloud associated with the SNR and compare the morphologies of the cloud and the gamma-ray emission. The distance and age of the SNR are estimated to be $3.3 \pm 0.6$~kpc and ${\sim}5$~kyr, respectively. From X-ray and GeV gamma-ray data analyses, we find an extended GeV gamma-ray emission overlapping with the SNR and H.E.S.S. source regions but no X-ray emission. The location of the peak of the extended GeV emission changes from near the SNR at $\lesssim 1$~GeV to the H.E.S.S. source at $&gt;10$~GeV. We find a spectral hardening at ${\sim}50$~GeV, which is consistent with the existence of two components in the gamma-ray emission. We find that a combination of emission from the escaped CRs and the SNR itself can reproduce the observed broadband spectrum, on the assumption that the SNR has accelerated protons to ${\gtrsim}100$~TeV in the past.</description>

      <title>RRAT-like behaviour of PSR B0656+14 observed with I-LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single pulse studies offer vital insights into the emission physics of pulsars, particularly in the case of young, nearby sources where intrinsic variability is often pronounced. PSR~B0656+14, known for its sporadic and sometimes intense pulses, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate such behaviour at low radio frequencies. This study aims to characterize the single pulse behaviour of PSR~B0656+14 using low-frequency observations at 110-190 MHz from the Irish LOFAR station. Single-pulse extraction is performed, and individual pulse DMs are estimated to probe pulse-to-pulse dispersion variability. We also perform a wait-time analysis to understand the statistical nature of pulse occurrence, and estimate the spectral index from frequency-resolved flux density measurements. The pulse energy distribution is modelled using a combination of log-normal and power-law components. A total of 41 pulses were detected in a 5-hour observation, allowing a wait-time distribution analysis which is well-modelled by an exponential function, indicative of a Poisson process. Profile stability analysis indicates that a significant number of pulses are required to reach a stable average profile, unusual compared to many other pulsars. The single-pulse spectral index varies significantly from pulse to pulse, with a mean value of $\alpha = -0.5$ and a standard deviation of $\Delta\alpha=1.3$. The pulse energy distribution shows a hybrid behaviour, consistent of a log-normal distribution and a power-law tail. Our results confirm that PSR~B0656+14 exhibits highly variable, memory-less emission at low frequencies, with characteristics that resemble those seen in some rotating radio transients (RRATs). If such variability proves to be widespread among pulsars, population synthesis models and survey yield predictions would need to incorporate this currently overlooked feature to ensure accuracy.</description>

      <title>New Molecular Dynamics Methods for Simulating Neutron Star Crusts with Superfluid Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluid vortices in neutron star crusts are thought to be pinned to the lattice of nuclei in the crust. The unpinning of superfluid vortices in spin glitches therefore motivates us to study the vortex-crust interaction explicitly with molecular dynamics. In this work, we present a new molecular dynamics methods to characterize the response of the crust to a rigid vortex. When vortex pinning forces and nearest neighbor Coulomb forces are comparable, we observe a qualitatively new phenomena of lattice entrainment with implications for the elastic evolution of the crust.</description>

      <title>Gamma/hadron discriminant variables in application to high-energy cosmic-ray air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of primary cosmic rays on an event-by-event basis is a much-desired capability of cosmic-ray observatories. Several cosmic-ray air-shower experiments use so-called photon tags for gamma hadron primary particle discrimination. These photon tag variables are derived from the total signals measured by an array of detectors and are correlated with the total number of muons in the air shower. In this work, variables based on time distribution of signals in detectors (trace-based discriminant variables) are studied and compared to total-signal-based variables. This study relies on simulated high-energy cosmic-ray air showers with energies around 10^17.5eV. Since the variables discussed are derived from total signals and their time traces, which can be directly measured in real data, they are suitable for use as discriminant variables in the real ground-based cosmic ray experiments.</description>

      <title>The Global Cosmic Ray Observatory -- Challenging next-generation multi-messenger astronomy with interdisciplinary research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the most intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics and high-energy physics. Since UHECRs with light mass compositions are less deflected by the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, their arrival directions are more strongly correlated with their origins. Charged-particle astronomy with UHECRs is hence a potentially viable probe of extremely energetic phenomena in the universe. The Global Cosmic Ray Observatory (GCOS) is a proposed next-generation observatory to elucidate these origins through precise measurements of UHECRs with unprecedented exposure and mass identification capabilities. We will focus on the ideas and requirements for GCOS summarized in arXiv:2502.05657 and share the recent advances in detector developments and future perspectives with interdisciplinary research.</description>

      <title>Chromatic activity window of periodic FRBs: FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two fast radio bursts, FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B, show periodic activity with cycles of 159.3 and 16.33 days, respectively. These cycles consist of active and inactive windows, with peak activity centered within the active phase. For FRB 20180916B, studies have reported a frequency-dependent-or ``chromatic''-behaviour, where the activity window starts earlier and becomes narrower at higher frequencies. The activity across frequencies is typically modeled with a power law. In this work, we develop a simple model that combines the phase and frequency dependence of the activity windows of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B. Our goal is to perform a chromaticity study for FRB 20121102A, incorporating model improvements to account for the cyclic nature of its activity window, and to compare the chromatic behaviour between both periodic FRBs. We standardise the detections from the 425 observing epochs for FRB 20121102A and the 214 epochs for FRB 20180916B to account for differences in radio telescope sensitivity. To the normalised detection rate phase distribution, we fit a von Mises distribution and extract the peak activity phase and activity width. These quantities, as a function of frequency, are then modelled as power-laws to construct the chromatic model. For both sources, the activity window starts earlier at higher frequencies. However, FRB 20121102A shows an activity window broadening at higher frequencies, while FRB 20180916B broadens at lower frequencies. FRB 20121102A appears to remain active during at least 80% of the cycle at C-band. The observed chromatic behaviour of FRB 20180916B is consistent with previous findings. For FRB 20121102A, a chromaticity in its activity window is also seen; however, the source appears to be active for longer at higher frequencies, opposite to the behaviour of FRB 20180916B.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Modeling Coronal X-ray Variability of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The corona is an integral component of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) which can produce the X-ray emission. However, many of its physical properties and the mechanisms powering this emission remain a mystery. In this work, we study the coronal X-ray variabilities of 13 AGNs by Gaussian Process. 2-10 keV light curves of 13 AGNs can be successfully described by the damped-random walk (DRW) model. The extracted coronal X-ray timescales range from 3 to 50 days. In the plot of variability timescale versus black hole mass, the coronal X-ray timescales of four sources occupy almost the same region as the optical timescales of the accretion disk, with the latter matching the predicted thermal instability timescale of the disk. In contrast, the X-ray timescales of the remaining sources exhibit a systematic offset toward lower values. We propose that the coronal X-ray variability may be driven by internal processes within the corona itself (such as thermal conduction). On the other hand, it may also be triggered by local thermal instabilities occurring in different regions (close to the central black hole) of the accretion disk, which propagate to the corona via disk-corona coupling.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric emissions of neutrinos in the cooling of rotating proto-neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate global asymmetry in the luminosities of neutrinos emitted from rapidly-rotating proto-neutron stars (PNS's). We build axisymmetric models of PNS's in mechanical equilibrium with rotation by adding prescribed angular momentum distributions by hand to non-rotational PNS models, which are extracted from a one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) PNS cooling calculation at different times: \(t=2, 6, 10, 20, 30\)s after a supernova explosion. We then conduct two-dimensional (spatially axisymmetric) neutrino transport calculations on top of them with the matter profiles (and the spacetime geometry) fixed. We find for the rapidly-rotating models with \(T/|W|\sim 5\times 10^{-2}\) that the neutrino luminosity changes by \(\sim 3 \% \) depending on the observer position. We give detailed analyses of the neutrino-hemispheres as well as the neutrino luminosities that are defined observer-wise. We also calculate the low-frequency (\(\lesssim 1{\rm Hz}\)) gravitational waves produced by the neutrinos radiated asymmetrically. We find that those gravitational waves, if emitted from the Galactic center, can be detected by planned detectors such as B-DECIGO, DECIGO and AILA. Finally, we look for crossings in the energy-integrated angular distributions in momentum space for the electron neutrino sector, a signature of the fast flavor conversion. We find them near the PNS surface in all models.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Unseen: The Discovery of Long-Awaited Radiation from the Intermittent Pulsar PSR B1931+24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are typically characterized by their stable, highly magnetized, and fast-rotating nature, which underpins their persistent radio emissions. However, the discovery of prolonged radio-quiet ("off") states in intermittent pulsars, such as PSR B1931+24, has challenged the most fundamental theory of pulsar magnetospheric emission. Despite long-term monitoring with several telescopes, continuous emission during these "off" states had not been detected in 20 years of observations. Fortunately, sensitive observations via Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) revealed the mysterious weak emission containing occasional bursting dwarf pulses during the "off" states of PSR B1931+24. Along with a substantial decrease in flux density, a significant contraction in the integrated pulse width is measured in the "off" state compared to the radio-loud ("on") state, indicating alterations in the plasma supply and magnetospheric structure. Additionally, a previously unobserved dyssynchronous, nonuniform emission pattern is found in both states, supporting theories of a spatially inhomogeneous pair-cascade mechanism and challenging models of spatially coherent discharge. Furthermore, occasional dwarf pulses detected during the "off" state show flux and width distributions similar to those of the "on" state pulses, suggesting a potential link between the "on" and "off" state emissions of PSR B1931+24. Consequently, dwarf pulses are unlikely to represent a distinct emission mode as previously thought; instead, they appear to be part of a continuum within the pulsar's emission behaviors observed during the "on" state. These findings strongly support the basic theory of the pulsar magnetospheric emission and significantly advance our understanding of pulsar magnetospheric dynamics and their emission mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Insights from the "Red devil" AT 2022fpx: A dust-reddened TDE family excluded by their apparent red color?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report unnoticed but intriguing features in the peculiar nuclear transient AT 2022fpx, and investigate its type. These features include the constantly red optical color of $g-r&gt;0$, stable soft X-ray flare ($kT\sim100$ eV) in the past $\sim$550 days, prominent mid-infrared echo peaked at $\sim$$10^{43.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the confirmation of a weak AGN by weak flares in pre-event WISE mid-infrared light curves with no contemporary optical, radio or X-ray counterparts. The combination of the optical red color and possible TDE origin of AT 2022fpx is particularly attractive, as it challenges the most widely accepted and adopted "blue color" criterion for optical TDE selection. Although we still cannot confirm whether the red color is intrinsic, we however find that the "blue color" criterion can filter out normal TDEs whose optical-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are either severely contaminated by prominent emission lines (especially H$\alpha$) or heavily dust-reddened. Hence, its potential selection effect may have been imprinted on the whole optical TDE family. Blackbody fitting on the optical (rest-frame $\sim$$4000-7000$ {\AA}) and optical-UV ($\sim$$2000-7000$ {\AA}) SEDs of four TDEs with high-cadence UV observations shows that $T_\mathrm{bb}$ rise by $\sim$40$-$110 % when the UV bands are included. The power-law models ($f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha=2-3$) can fit the rest-frame $\sim$$2000-7000$ {\AA} SEDs more consistently, indicating that SEDs should peak at shorter wavelengths, but not simple blackbodies. Hence, the estimated released energy for the optical-UV bright but X-ray faint TDEs based on blackbody SED fitting should be significantly lower than the intrinsic energy.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Nebular-Phase Calculations of Dynamically-Driven Double-Degenerate Double-Detonation Models for Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation model has emerged as a promising progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae. In this scenario, the primary white dwarf ignites due to dynamical interaction with a companion white dwarf, which may also undergo a detonation. Consequently, two scenarios exist: one in which the secondary survives and another in which both white dwarfs detonate. In either case, substantial departures from spherical symmetry are imprinted on the ejecta. Here, we compute full non local thermodynamic equilibrium nebular-phase spectra in 1D and 3D to probe the innermost asymmetries. Our simulations reveal that the multidimensional structures significantly alter the overall ionisation balance, width and velocity of features, especially when the secondary detonates. In this scenario, some element distributions may produce orientation-dependent line profiles that can be centrally peaked from some viewing-angles and somewhat flat-topped from others. Comparison to observations reveals that both scenarios produce most observed features from the optical to mid-infrared. However, the current model realisations do not consistently reproduce all line shapes or relative strengths, and yield prominent optical Ar III emission which is inconsistent with the data. When the secondary detonates, including 3D effects, improves the average agreement with observations, however when compared to observations, particularly weak optical Co III emission and the presence of optical O I and near-infrared S I challenge its viability for normal Type Ia supernovae. Thus, our comparisons with normal Type Ia's tentatively favour detonation of only the primary white dwarf, but we stress that more model realisations and mid-infrared observations are needed.</description>

      <title>Strongly polarised radio pulses from a new white-dwarf-hosting long-period transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period transients (LPTs) are a new and enigmatic class of objects that produce bright pulsations in the radio, with periods far exceeding those seen in rotationally powered pulsars. The proposed progenitors for LPTs are contested, with white dwarfs or magnetars being likely candidates. Here, we present the discovery of ILT\,J163430+445010, a new LPT detected in a blind search for Stokes\,V transients in the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey. Unusual for LPTs, J1634+44 shows pulses that are 100\% circularly polarised, as well as pulses that are 100\% linearly polarised, with the polarisation state changing from pulse to pulse. We detect 19 pulses in total, each with a total polarisation fraction of $\sim100\%$ and a pulse duration of at most 10\,s. The pulses show a periodicity at $841.24808\pm0.00015$\,s, implying a low duty cycle of $0.012$. J1634+44 has a marginally detected counterpart in the ultraviolet GALEX MIS survey and the ultraviolet/optical UNIONS survey, suggesting that it contains a white dwarf with an effective temperature between 15000\,K and 33000\,K. We do not detect J1634+44 with a deep $J$-band exposure with UKIRT at a $3\sigma$ AB magnitude limit of 24.7, ruling out a main-sequence star or ultracool dwarf with a spectral type earlier than M7. The pulses from J1634+44 follow a particular pattern, with two pulses being produced every five periods after a waiting time of two or three periods. This pattern could be a result of spin-orbit coupling in a binary system with a 5:2 or 5:3 resonance, where a companion induces beamed radio emission on the white dwarf. The companion is most likely an ultracool dwarf or another white dwarf, making J1634+44 unique among the currently known sample of LPTs.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo radiation hydrodynamic simulations of line-driven disc winds: relaxing the isothermal approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disc winds play a crucial role in many accreting astrophysical systems across all scales. In accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN), radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising wind-driving mechanism. However, the efficiency of line driving is extremely sensitive to the ionization state of the flow, making it difficult to construct a reliable physical picture of these winds. Recently, we presented the first radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations for AWDs that incorporated detailed, multi-dimensional ionization calculations via fully frequency-dependent radiative transfer, using the Sirocco code coupled to PLUTO. These simulations produced much weaker line-driven winds (Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc &lt; 1e-5 for our adopted parameters) than earlier studies using more approximate treatments of ionization and radiative transfer (which yielded Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc ~ 1e-4). One remaining limitation of our work was the assumption of an isothermal outflow. Here, we relax this by adopting an ideal gas equation of state and explicitly solving for the multi-dimensional temperature structure of the flow. In the AWD setting, accounting for the thermal state of the wind does not change the overall conclusions drawn from the isothermal approximation. Our new simulations confirm the line-driving efficiency problem: the predicted outflows are too highly ionized, meaning they neither create optimal driving conditions nor reproduce the observed ultraviolet wind signatures. Possible solutions include wind clumping on sub-grid scales, a softer-than-expected spectral energy distribution, or additional driving mechanisms. With the physics now built into our simulations, we are well-equipped to also explore line-driven disc winds in AGN.</description>

      <title>CHIME/FRB Discovery of an Unusual Circularly Polarized Long-Period Radio Transient with an Accelerating Spin Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of CHIME J1634+44, a Long Period Radio Transient (LPT) unique for two aspects: it is the first known LPT to emit fully circularly polarized radio bursts, and it is the first LPT with a significant spin-up. Given that high circular polarization ($&gt;90$\%) has been observed in FRB~20201124A and in some giant pulses of PSR~B1937+21, we discuss the implications of the high circular polarization of CHIME J1634+44 and conclude its emission mechanism is likely to be ``pulsar-like''. While CHIME J1634+44 has a pulse period of 841 s, its burst arrival patterns are indicative of a secondary 4206 s period, probably associated with binary activity. The timing properties suggest it has a significantly negative period derivative of $\dot{P}=-9.03(0.11)$ s s$^{-1}$. Few systems have been known to spin-up, most notably transitional millisecond pulsars and cataclysmic binaries, both of which seem unlikely progenitors for CHIME J1634+44. If the period was only associated with the spin of the object, then the spin up is likely generated by accretion of material from a companion. If, however, the radio pulse period and the orbital period are locked, as appears to be the case for two other LPTs, the spin up of CHIME J1634+44 could be driven by gravitational wave radiation.</description>

      <title>Ti\={a}ngu\={a}n ($\zeta$ Tau) as a binary system consisting of a Be-star and an accreting White Dwarf: opening a gate to understanding enigmatic $\gamma$ Cas analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analogues of $\gamma$ Cassiopea are binary early type Be stars which are X-ray bright and have hard thermal X-ray spectra. The nature of low-mass companions in these stars and mechanisms of their X-ray emission remain enigmatic. Among the proposed ideas is the presence of an accretion disc around a white dwarf (WD) companion to the Be star donor. We use modern radiative transfer models accounting for reflection physics in order to calculate the synthetic spectra of such systems, and assume that the hottest plasma is thermal and is located in the accretion disc boundary layer. The models are then used to analyse the archival X-ray observations of the $\gamma$ Cas analogue $\zeta$ Tau (a.k.a. Ti\={a}ngu\={a}n) which were obtained by the XMM-Newton telescope. Comparisons with X-ray-emitting symbiotic systems, particularly $\delta$- and $\beta/\delta$-type systems, support the idea that the hard X-ray emission in $\zeta$ Tau is best explained by a WD accreting wind material of the Be star. The plasma temperature and luminosity of the boundary layer associated with the accretion disc are used to estimate a mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} \approx 4\times 10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, implying a nova recurrence time above 10$^{5}$ yr. Our analysis advances the understanding the production of hard X-ray emission in $\gamma$ Cas analogues, further supporting the idea of accreting WDs as companions of Be-stars in these systems.</description>

      <title>Testing the ubiquitous presence of very high energy emission in gamma-ray bursts with the MAGIC telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful transient objects in the Universe, and they are a primary target for the MAGIC Collaboration. Recognizing the challenges of observing these elusive objects with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), we implemented a dedicated observational strategy that included an automated procedure for rapid re-pointing to transient sources. Since 2013, this automated procedure has enabled MAGIC to observe GRBs at a rate of approximately ten per year, which led to the successful detection of two GRBs at very high energies (VHE; E &gt; 100 GeV). We present a comprehensive analysis of 42 non-detected GRBs (4 short GRBs) observed by MAGIC from 2013 to 2019. We derived upper limits (ULs) on the observed energy flux as well as on the intrinsic energy flux corrected for absorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL) from the MAGIC observations in selected energy and time intervals. We conducted a comprehensive study of their properties to investigate the reasons for these non-detections, including the possible peculiar properties of TeV-detected GRBs. We find that strong EBL absorption significantly hinders TeV detection for the majority of GRBs in our sample. For a subset of 6 GRBs with redshift z &lt; 2, we compared the UL on the intrinsic flux in the VHE domain with the simultaneous X-ray flux, which is observed to be at the same level in the current population of TeV-detected GRBs. Based on these inferred MAGIC ULs, we conclude that a VHE component with a luminosity comparable to the simultaneously observed X-ray luminosity cannot be ruled out for this sample.</description>

      <title>Road through Dark$\nu$ess: Probing dark matter-neutrino interactions using KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: KM3NeT has recently reported an event where a muon of energy $120^{+110}_{-60}$ PeV was observed at its ARCA detector, which can stem from a very high-energy neutrino interaction in the vicinity of the detector. Besides revolutionizing our understanding of high-energy neutrino sources, this event can serve as a valuable probe for studying Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) interactions of neutrinos. In this work, we study the dark matter (DM)-neutrino interaction by assuming the neutrino for the event KM3-230213A is originated from a blazar. The flux of such neutrinos, traveling through DM distributed across astrophysical and cosmological scales, can get attenuated due to DM interactions. The detection of such event by KM3NeT allows us to place constraints on the interaction cross section at highest-ever neutrino energy. We derive both conservative constraints-neglecting flux attenuation from the host halo-and optimistic ones by including host halo contributions. Our results show that the energy-independent constraints are weaker than previous bounds. For energy-dependent case, the extreme energy of the event allows us to set some of the strongest limits on scattering cross sections. In future, more such neutrino events with well-understood origin will be essential in constraining or potentially discovering DM-neutrino interactions.</description>

      <title>The properties of X-ray selected AGN in protoclusters pinpointed by Enormous Lya Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoclusters of galaxies are overdense regions of the Universe characterized by large gas reservoirs. Such environments make them perfect laboratories to investigate galaxy-AGN co-evolution and the growth of SMBHs. Galaxies living in such a dense regions are expected to growth efficiently their SMBH, resulting in a higher incidence of AGN than in the field. Some protoclusters exhibit extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae in their central region, pinpointing the presence of massive gas reservoirs, but whose main powering mechanism is still debated. We aim to investigate the AGN population, and AGN enhancement, in three protoclusters at 2.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 which host enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe). Additionally, we search for the presence of X-ray diffuse emission in the same region of the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae to reveal multi-phase gas in these protoclusters. We use deep (190-270 ks) Chandra observations to identify AGN among the protocluster members and perform X-ray spectral analysis to derive the properties of those sources. We compare the AGN fraction and space density with those observed in other known protoclusters and from the field environment. We find 11 X-ray detected AGN in the three protoclusters. Each structure hosts a central, X-ray powerful (log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}) \sim 45-46$), QSO, while the other X-ray sources are mostly moderately luminous (log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}) \sim 44$) and obscured Compton-Thin AGN. The fraction of AGN in our targets is comparable with estimates for other protoclusters, and significantly higher than what is found for low-redshift clusters. We also find a significant enhancement (2-4 dex) of AGN density with respect to the field and to non active galaxies in the protoclusters. Finally, we find no significant soft X-ray diffuse emissions from the nebulae, thus ruling out gravitational heating as the main powering mechanism of the ELANe.</description>

      <title>Lower bound on the proper lengths of stationary bound-state charged massive scalar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been revealed that charged scalar clouds, spatially regular matter configurations which are made of linearized charged massive scalar fields, can be supported by spinning and charged Kerr-Newman black holes. Using analytical techniques, we establish a no-short hair theorem for these stationary bound-state field configurations. In particular, we prove that the effective proper lengths of the supported charged massive scalar clouds are bounded from below by the remarkably compact dimensionless relation $\ell/M&gt;\ln(3+\sqrt{8})$, where $M$ is the mass of the central supporting black hole. Intriguingly, this lower bound is universal in the sense that it is valid for all Kerr-Newman black-hole spacetimes [that is, in the entire regime $\{a/M\in(0,1],Q/M\in[0,1)\}$ of the dimensionless spin and charge parameters that characterize the central supporting black holes] and for all values of the physical parameters (electric charge $q$, proper mass $\mu$, and angular harmonic indexes $\{l,m\}$) that characterize the supported stationary bound-state scalar fields.</description>

      <title>The physical mechanism of radio-quiet turn-on changing-look active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is suggested that the variation of mass accretion rate in accretion disk may be responsible for the occurrence of most changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL AGNs). However, the viscous timescale of a thin disk is far longer than the observed timescale of CL AGNs. Though this problem can be resolved by introducing the large-scale magnetic field, the mechanism for radio-quiet CL AGNs with weak/absent large-scale magnetic field remains a mystery. In this work, we assume that the thin accretion disk is collapsed from the inner advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) instead of substituting by the outer thin disk through advection. This idea is tested by comparing the cooling timescale ($t_{\rm cool}$) of an ADAF with the observed timescale ($t_{\rm tran}$) of turn-on CL AGNs. We compile a sample of 102 turn-on CL AGNs from the archived data and calculate the cooling timescale of an ADAF with the critical mass accretion rate based on some conventional assumptions. It is found that $t_{\rm cool}$ is much shorter than $t_{\rm tran}$ in most of the CL AGNs, which validates our assumption though $t_{\rm cool}$ is not consistent with $t_{\rm tran}$ ($t_{\rm cool}&lt;t_{\rm tran}$). However, this is reasonable since most of the CL AGNs were observed only two times, indicating that the observed timescale $t_{\rm tran}$ is the maximum value because the changing-look can indeed happen before the second observation.</description>

      <title>Spherical Orbital Dynamics and Relativistic Precession in Kerr-MOG Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and relativistic precessions of massive particles on spherical orbits around Kerr-MOG black holes in scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG). By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we derive conserved quantities and analyze how the MOG parameter $\alpha$ and orbital tilt angle $\zeta$ influence the innermost stable spherical orbits (ISSOs) and orbital stability. We compute the nodal and periastron precession frequencies, finding that nodal precession increases monotonically with both black hole spin and MOG parameter, while periastron precession exhibits a more complex behavior: MOG amplifies curvature-induced effects, which can be partially counteracted by spin. Furthermore, to complement the orbital analysis, we examine the Lense-Thirring spin precession of a gyroscope and demonstrate its sensitivity to the MOG parameter, spin, and orbital tilt angle. These results reveal distinctive signatures of modified gravity in orbital dynamics and provide a potential observational probe to test deviations from general relativity near rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Impact of cosmic-ray propagation on the chemistry and ionisation fraction of dark clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proper modelling of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate within gas clouds is crucial to describe their chemical evolution accurately. However, this modelling is computationally demanding because it requires the propagation of cosmic rays throughout the cloud over time. We present a more efficient approach that simultaneously guarantees a reliable estimate of the cosmic-ray impact on the chemistry of prestellar cores. We introduce a numerical framework that mimics the cosmic-ray propagation within gas clouds and applies it to magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the code GIZMO. It simulates the cosmic-ray attenuation by computing the effective column density of H$_2$ that is traversed, which is estimated using the same kernel weighting approach as employed in the simulation. The obtained cosmic-ray ionisation rate is then used in post-processing to study the chemical evolution of the clouds. We found that cosmic-ray propagation affects deuterated and non-deuterated species significantly and that it depends on the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. We explored correlations between the electron abundance, the cosmic-ray ionisation rate, and the abundance of the most relevant ions (HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$, and o-H$_2$D$^+$), with the purpose of finding simple expressions that link them. We provide an analytical formula to estimate the ionisation fraction, X(e$^-$), from observable tracers and applied it to existing observations of high-mass clumps. We obtained values of about 10$^{-8}$, which is in line with previous works and with expectations for dense clouds. We also provide a linear fit to calculate the cosmic-ray ionisation rate from the local H$_2$ density, which is to be employed in three-dimensional simulations that do not include cosmic-ray propagation.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the bright ring-like features and polarization structures
  in the Kerr-Sen black hole's images based on general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, which are illuminated by the 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Using the REx method, we extracted the bright ring from the black hole images and found that both the bright ring and black hole shadow shrink as the dilation parameter increases. Combing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters for different observed inclinations and disk thicknesses. Our results show that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observed inclination. We also probe the rotational symmetry of EVPA in the polarization structure of the black hole images by analyzing the coefficient $\beta_2$. The dilaton parameter results in that the real part $Re\beta_2$ increases and the imaginary part $Im\beta_2$ decreases, but the magnitude $|\beta_2|$ generally exhibits a declining trend. Finally, we find that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way is a Laboratory for New Ultra-long-baseline Neutrino Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory recently published evidence for diffuse neutrino emission from the Galactic Plane at $4.5\sigma$ significance. This new source of astrophysical neutrinos provides an exciting laboratory for probing the nature of neutrino masses. In particular, extremely small mass splittings, such as those predicted by quasi-Dirac neutrino mass models, and finite neutrino lifetimes from neutrino decays, would induce effects on the spectra and flavor ratios of neutrinos with TeV-scale energies traversing kiloparsec-scale baselines. Using $\mathtt{TANDEM}$, an upcoming three dimensional galactic neutrino emission model, we explore the sensitivity of IceCube and KM3NeT/ARCA to these ultra-long-baseline phenomena. We find that a combined analysis would be sensitive to quasi-Dirac mass splittings $10^{-14.0}~\mathrm{eV^2} \lesssim \delta m^2 \lesssim 10^{11.6}~\mathrm{eV^2}$ and neutrino lifetimes $m / \tau \gtrsim 10^{-14.1}~\mathrm{eV^2}$ at $&gt; 1\sigma$, both regions constituting as-yet unexplored parameter space. Our results demonstrate the potential that astrophysical neutrino sources and global neutrino telescope networks have in probing new regions of exotic neutrino mass models.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of inclined cosmic-ray properties with GRAND data</title>

Abstract: Radio-detection is now an established technique for studying ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays with energies exceeding $\sim 10^{17}$ eV. The next generation of radio experiments, such as the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), aims to expand this technique to the observation of Earth-skimming UHE neutrinos, which requires the detection of very inclined extensive air showers (EAS). Currently, GRAND is validating its detection principle -- autonomous radio detection -- in particular through the prototype array GRANDProto300, deployed in the Gobi Desert. In this phase, the array is limited to detecting inclined EAS from cosmic rays. Neutrinos cannot be observed because of the restricted detector size. We present a method to reconstruct the arrival direction and energy of EAS with zenith angles above $60^\circ$, applicable as well to upward-going trajectories. The approach combines a point-source-like description of the radio wavefront with the so-called Angular Distribution Function (ADF), a phenomenological model describing the angular pattern of radio signal amplitudes in the 50--200 MHz band. Applied directly to the voltage traces, this method enables efficient event selection with accurate direction reconstruction and a first-order energy estimate. We validate the approach with both simulations and experimental data, and reconstruct the first cosmic-ray candidates detected by GRANDProto300.</description>

Abstract: The NUTRIG project is dedicated to the development of advanced radio self-trigger methods for large-scale arrays such as the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND). The developed techniques are based on features of the radio emission of air showers to perform an efficient online rejection of background. We first describe a first-level trigger (FLT) template-matching method that uses the shape of transient radio pulses measured at the detection-unit level to target those induced by air showers. We present trigger efficiencies and throughput tests of the template-matching FLT in controlled laboratory conditions. Next, we describe the second-level trigger (SLT), which utilizes the measured FLT times and corresponding voltage amplitudes to construct a trigger at the array level. We present offline performances of the SLT, which performs a coarse reconstruction of timing, direction, and polarization of the air shower.</description>

      <title>From $U(1) \times U(1)$ Symmetry Breaking to Majoron Cosmology: Insights from NANOGrav 15-year Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of a modified majoron model motivated by the need to protect a global $U(1)$ symmetry from gravity-induced hard explicit breaking (by $d \leq 4$ operators) at the Planck scale. The model extends the Standard Model by introducing a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry, each spontaneously broken by a corresponding complex scalar singlet. This setup gives rise to a network of effectively global and local cosmic strings, whose stochastic gravitational wave signals can jointly account for the spectrum observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, particularly for majoron masses $m_{\chi} &lt; 10^{-23}$ eV. Although the fit is not as strong as that from supermassive black hole mergers, the model still provides an alternative explanation rooted in high-energy physics. The model also generates light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and avoids cosmological constraints from $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$, CMB anisotropies, and isocurvature fluctuations. Although the majoron can contribute to dark matter through thermal, coherent oscillation, and string-induced production mechanisms, its relic abundance remains subdominant in the NANOGrav-compatible region. In contrast, the measured dark matter relic density is achievable at higher $m_\chi$, though at the cost of tension with cosmological bounds. If the NANOGrav fits are viewed as constraints, given their comparatively lower Bayes factors, they yield bounds that are significantly stronger than those imposed by the CMB and other cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Quantum Matter Revisited: Flat-Band Topological States on a Zero-Flux Dipole Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study strongly correlated fractional topological phases on a two-sphere threaded by a magnetic dipole field with globally vanishing flux. Solving the Dirac equation in this background produces spheroidal wavefunctions forming a highly degenerate manifold of normalizable zero modes, with degeneracy proportional to the total absolute flux. We introduce a non-Abelian spin gauge field near the equator to hybridize the north and south domain-confined modes, forming a global flat band. Projecting interactions into this band yields Laughlin-type correlated states. The entanglement spectrum shows a chiral tower consistent with a virtual edge, demonstrating bulk-edge correspondence in a closed geometry. This generalizes the zero-flux flat-band construction of \cite{Parhizkar:2024som} to curved backgrounds, with potential applications to synthetic and astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) Project</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring ultra-high energy neutrinos, with energies above $10^{16}$ eV, is the next frontier of the emerging multi-messenger era. Their detection requires building a large-scale detector with 10 times the instantaneous sensitivity of current instruments, sub-degree angular resolution, and wide daily field of view. The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to be that discovery instrument. HERON combines the complementary features of two radio techniques being demonstrated by the BEACON and GRAND prototypes. Its preliminary design consists of 24 compact, elevated phased stations with 24 antennas each, embedded in a sparse array of 360 standalone antennas. This setup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux should be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the powerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an optimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m across a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina's San Juan province. It would be connected to the worldwide network of multimessenger observatories and search for neutrino bursts from candidate sources of cosmic rays, like gamma-ray bursts and other powerful transients. With HERON's deep sensitivity, this strategy targets discoveries that cast new light into the inner workings of the most violent astrophysical sources at uncharted energies. We present the preliminary design, performances, and observation strategy of HERON.</description>

      <title>A multi-parameter expansion for the evolution of asymmetric binaries in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries with large mass asymmetries - such as Extreme and Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals - are unique probes of the astrophysical environments in which they evolve. Their long-lived and intricate dynamics allow for precise inference of source properties, provided waveform models are accurate enough to capture the full complexity of their orbital evolution. In this work, we develop a multi-parameter formalism, inspired by vacuum perturbation theory, to model asymmetric binaries embedded in general matter distributions with both radial and tangential pressures. In the regime of small deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, relevant to most astrophysical scenarios, the system admits a simplified description, where both metric and fluid perturbations can be cast into wave equations closely related to those of the vacuum case. This framework offers a practical approach to modeling the dynamics and the gravitational wave emission from binaries in realistic matter distributions, and can be modularly integrated with existing results for vacuum sources.</description>

      <title>Recasting Experimental Constraints on Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles with masses up to $10^{14}$ GeV can be accelerated to relativistic velocities in Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. The cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles is constrained by various experiments, with the limits given as functions of the monopole velocity (Lorentz factor) at the detectors. The velocity, however, is usually treated as a free parameter due to the ambiguity in the computation of the acceleration before the monopoles arrive at Earth. We explicitly evaluate the velocity by exploiting recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields and the monopole acceleration therein, to recast experimental limits in terms of the mass of monopoles. By applying our method to various terrestrial experiments, including the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, MACRO, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as well as to astrophysical constraints, we report limits on the flux of monopoles for a wide range of monopole masses. We also highlight the role of monopoles as messengers of cosmic magnetic fields, and discuss the possibility of using monopole experiments to probe intergalactic magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Overlapping gravitational wave (GW) signals are expected in the third-generation (3G) GW detectors, leading to one of the major challenges in GW data analysis. Inference of overlapping GW sources is complicated - it has been reported that hierarchical inference with signal subtraction may amplify errors, while joint estimation, though more accurate, is computationally expensive. However, in this work, we show that hierarchical subtraction can achieve accurate results with a sufficient number of iterations, and on the other hand, neural density estimators, being able to generate posterior samples rapidly, make it possible to perform signal subtraction and inference repeatedly. We further develop likelihood-based resampling to accelerate the convergence of the iterative subtraction. Our method provides fast and accurate inference for overlapping GW signals and is highly adaptable to various source types and time separations, offering a potential general solution for overlapping GW signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Search for Periodic Variability in $\gamma$-ray Blazars Using \textit{Fermi}-LAT</title>

Abstract: Blazars are known to exhibit variability across a broad range of timescales. This behavior can include periodicity in their $\gamma$-ray emission, whose clear detection remains an ongoing challenge, partly due to the inherent stochasticity of the processes involved and also the lack of adequately well-sampled light curves. In this study, we perform a systematic search for periodicity in a selected sample of 24 $\gamma$-ray blazars using twelve years of Fermi-LAT data. The sample comprises the most promising candidates selected from a previous study, extending the light curves by three additional years, expanding the analyzed energy range from $&gt;$1~GeV to $&gt;$0.1~GeV to improve photon statistics, and enhancing the time-series analysis methodology. We incorporate upper-limit flux points in the analysis rather than discarding them, thereby preserving the temporal structure in the light curves. A suite of seven complementary time-series analysis methods is employed to ensure statistical robustness, including autoregressive models, representing a methodological advancement over the prior work. A further improvement is the explicit estimation of the look-elsewhere effect, which allows us to assess the global significance of any detected signals. The study is also supported by additional statistical treatments employed to minimize false detections and strengthen the reliability of the results. Our analysis reveals a hint of periodicity in PG 1553+113 with a global significance of $\approx$1.8$\sigma$. For the remaining sources in the sample, the re-evaluation of previously reported periodicities indicates that they are statistically consistent with arising from stochastic variability.</description>

      <title>Looking for Black Hole Morsels in Astrophysical Mergers via Hawking Radiation</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave observation has provided numerous insights into the merger of astrophysical black holes. In contrast to other violent events (e.g. supernovae), they are, however, not expected to lead to significant emissions of photons and neutrinos. In this paper we discuss a scenario that would lead to characteristic observable gamma ray bursts, which would provide numerous hints to physics beyond General Relativity. Starting from the hypothesis that micro-black holes (called morsels) are formed during the merger process, we show that it is possible to observe their Hawking radiation, which takes the form of gamma ray bursts of a uniquely characteristic form: with energies in the TeV range, their temporal structure is unlike that stemming from any other astrophysical event. Notably, the time delay from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels, allowed by the unaccounted merger mass, leads to a Hawking radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC, and gamma ray space telescopes, such as Fermi-LAT. This renders the hypothesis of morsel creation experimentally testable, and we provide the first concrete bounds on the total mass of morsels formed in specific events.</description>

      <title>Catalog of outbursts of neutron star LMXBs</title>

Abstract: Many X-ray binaries are transiently accreting. Having statistics on their recurrence times is helpful to address questions related to binary evolution and populations, as well as the physics of binary systems. We compile a catalog of known outbursts of 87 transient neutron star (identified through bursts or pulsations) low-mass X-ray binaries, until mid-2025. Most outbursts are taken from the literature, but we also identify some outbursts from public X-ray monitoring lightcurves. We find 109 outbursts not previously identified in the literature; most are from the frequent transients GRS 1747-312 and the Rapid Burster MXB 1730-335, though we suspect that two outbursts from Liller 1 may be from another transient, besides the Rapid Burster. We also find new outbursts for 10 other systems, and verify substantial quiescent intervals for XMM J174457-2850.3, XMMU J174716.1-281048, and AX J1754.2-2754. Outburst detection has been relatively efficient since 1996 for outbursts above $F_X$(2-10)$=3\times10^{-10}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. While several systems have many known outbursts, 40 of the 87 systems we track have zero or one recorded outburst between 1996 and 2023. This suggests that many faint Galactic Center X-ray binaries may be neutron star X-ray binaries, though we cannot completely rule out the proposition that most neutron star X-ray binaries undergo frequent outbursts below all-sky monitor detection limits.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger signatures of a deformed magnetar in gamma-ray bursts</title>

Abstract: We study the evolution of a newly formed magnetized neutron-star (NS) as a power source of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the light of both gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) radiations. The compressible and incompressible fluids are employed in order to model the secular evolution of stable Maclaurian spheroids. It is shown that the GW and EM emissions evolve as a function of eccentricity and rotational frequency with time. We find that the luminosity characteristics crucially depend on NS parameters such as magnitude and structure of magnetic field, ellipticity and the equation of state (EoS) of the fluid. The presence of X-ray flares, whose origins are not yet well understood, can be captured in our model regarding some specific nuclear EoSs. Our model allowing us to explain flares that occur within the wide range of $ 10$ to $10^4$ s and the peak EM luminosity in the order of $10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\rm \text{erg} s^{-1}$ by using a reasonable set of parameters, such as magnetic field strength around $10^{14}-10^{16}$ G, the quadrupole-to-dipole ratio of magnetic field up to 500. By applying our model to a sample of GRB X-ray flares observed by the Swift/X-ray Telescope, we try to constraint the crucial parameters of a deformed magnetar via a Marcov Chain Monte Carlo fitting method. Our analysis shows that ongoing and upcoming joint multimessenger detections can be used to understand the nature of a GRB's central engine and its evolution at the early times of the burst formation.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Cygni supernova remnant in $\gamma$-rays: signatures of trapped and escaped Cosmic Rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reanalyze 15 years of data recorded by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in a region around supernova remnant (SNR) $\gamma$-Cygni from 100 MeV to 1 TeV, and find that the spectra of two extended sources associated with the southeast radio SNR arc and the TeV VERITAS source can be described well by single power-laws with photon indices of $2.149\pm0.005$ and $2.01\pm0.06$, respectively. Combining with high resolution observations of surrounding gas, we model the emission in the hadronic scenario, where the $\gamma$-ray emission could be interpreted as escaped cosmic ray (CR) illuminating a nearby Molecular Cloud (MC) plus an ongoing shock-cloud interaction component. In this scenario, the difference between the two GeV spectral indices is due to the different ratios of MC mass between the escaped component and the trapped component in the two regions. We further analyze, in a potential pulsar halo region, the relationship between energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$, spin-down power $\dot{E}$, and the $\gamma$-ray luminosity $L_{\gamma}$ of PSR J2021+4026. Our results indicate that the existence of a pulsar halo is unlikely. On the other hand, considering the uncertainty on the SNR distance, the derived energy density $\varepsilon_{\rm{e}}$ might be overestimated, thus the scenario of a SNR and a pulsar halo overlapping in the direction of the line of sight (LOS) cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Let there be neutrons! Hadronic photoproduction from a large flux of high-energy photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that neutrons may be generated in high-energy, high-flux photon environments via photo-induced reactions on pre-existing baryons. These photohadronic interactions are expected to occur in astrophysical jets and surrounding material. Historically, these reactions have been attributed to the production of high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. We estimate the photoproduction off of protons in the context of gamma-ray bursts, where it is expected there will be sufficient baryonic material that may be encompassing or entrained in the jet. We show that typical stellar baryonic material, even material completely devoid of neutrons, can become inundated with neutrons in situ via hadronic photoproduction. Consequently, this mechanism provides a means for collapsars and other astrophysical sites containing substantial flux of high-energy photons to be favorable for neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>On the effective spin-mass ratio relation of binary black hole mergers that evolved in isolation</title>

Abstract: The ground-based measurement of gravitational waves (GW) from merging binary black holes (BBH) uniquely allows determination of spins of stellar-remnant black holes (BH), thereby offering insights into their formation mechanisms. The observed population of BBH mergers exhibits two intriguing peculiarities related to BH spins, namely, a positively biased distribution of effective spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and an apparent anti-correlation between merger mass ratio, $q$, and $\chi_{\rm eff}$. Here we investigate the potential mechanisms for such observed properties, in BBH mergers via isolated binary evolution. We synthesize BBH mergers with the fast binary evolution code BSE. The role of various physical assumptions is explored, including tidal spin-up, compact remnant mass, and mass transfer physics. We compare the properties of WR-BH binaries that formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) and common envelope evolution (CE). We find that both the asymmetry in $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution and the $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ anti-correlation are natural outcomes of isolated-binary BBH formation with the standard assumptions on mass transfer physics. The anti-correlation is particularly pronounced for SMT-channel BBH mergers that experience a mass-ratio-reversal, i.e., those where the second-born BH is the more massive member. The anti-correlation arises from the dependence of orbital shrinking during mass transfer and the Roche lobe size on the system's mass ratio. This characteristic $\chi_{\rm eff}-q$ trend diminishes with increasing metallicity and when the isolated-binary BBH merger population is mixed with a significant contribution of dynamically formed BBH mergers. Our results demonstrate that isolated massive binary evolution via the SMT sub-channel can reproduce the observable BBH merger population, with characteristic signatures in mass, mass ratio, and spin distributions.[abr.]</description>

      <title>Prospect of Gamma-Ray Burst Neutrino Detection with Enhanced Neutrino Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been proposed as a potential source of high-energy neutrinos. Although no confirmed association between GRBs and neutrinos has been established, meaningful constraints have been placed on GRB prompt emission models. The nondetection of neutrinos, reported by the IceCube Collaboration, from both single and stacked GRB events suggests that the radiation zone is likely located at a considerable distance from the central engine, where the photon number density is relatively low. Here, we estimate future GRB neutrino detection probabilities using detectors with a higher simulated sensitivity than IceCube and explore the constraints on models if GRB neutrinos remain undetected despite improved sensitivity. Our findings reveal that if the effective area of a future neutrino detector can be enhanced by a factor of 10 compared to IceCube IC86-II, there is a high likelihood of detecting neutrinos from a GRB 221009A-like event, even in the context of the ICMART model, which exhibits the lowest efficiency in neutrino production. With such an advanced detector (enhanced by a factor of 10) and 5-10 yr of data accumulation, neutrinos from stacked GRBs should be identifiable, or several popular models for GRB prompt emission (e.g., the dissipative photosphere model and internal shock model) could be effectively ruled out.</description>

      <title>Core Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave Sourcing and Characterization based on Three-Dimensional Models</title>

Abstract: We present for the first time an analysis of high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) emission from proto-neutron stars (PNS) in core collapse supernovae (CCSN) that combines spatial decomposition and modal decomposition to both source and characterize the emission using three-dimensional CCSN simulations. We analyze simulations initiated from 15 and 25 solar mass progenitors with Solar- and zero-metallicity respectively. We decompose the GW strains into five spatial regions and find that strains are initially largest in the PNS surface layers from accretion and later largest from the Ledoux convective and convective overshoot regions of the PNS. We compute the fractional GW luminosity as a function of enclosed radius and observe that most of the luminosity moves from the PNS surface to deep within the PNS at later times. Using a self-consistent perturbative analysis, we investigate the evolution of the oscillation modes of the PNS. We find that the frequency of the evolving high-frequency component of the GW signal is well matched to the eigenfrequency evolution of the ${}^2g_2$-, ${}^2g_1$-, and ${}^2f$-modes over time. We show that the ${}^2g$-modes emit most of their power in GW initially from the PNS surface region, but within a few 100 ms after bounce, it is the convective overshoot region of the PNS that emits the most GW power for the ${}^2g_1$-mode. Eventually, the ${}^2f$-mode is the dominant mode producing GWs, and they are emitted primarily from the convective overshoot region. Thus, we show that, while the GW emission is global, it is possible to source the dominant contributions to it. We find that the source of the high-frequency GW emission from the PNS in CCSN is more complex than assessed by other methods, as well as time dependent, first emitted by ${}^2g$-modes driven by accretion onto the PNS and later emitted by the ${}^2f$-mode driven by sustained Ledoux convection.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Rotating White Dwarfs and Multimessenger Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results of numerical relativity simulations for the collapse of rotating magnetized white dwarfs (WDs) in three dimension, aiming at discussing the explosion dynamics and associate multi-messenger signals: gravitational waves (GWs), neutrinos, and electromagnetic counterparts. All WDs initiate gravitational collapse due to electron captures and then experience prompt type explosions after the proto neutron star formation. We observe the explosions dominated by a bipolar structure and the emergence of strong spiral waves in rapidly rotating models. The spiral waves facilitate to increase both the explosion energy and ejecta mass, though the final values still fall in the category of low explosion energy supernovae with small ejecta mass. The spiral waves also produce strong GWs, which may expand the horizon distance of such events against GWs up to ~10 Mpc for third-generation ground-based detectors. Additionally as an intriguing implication, we demonstrate that such accretion or merger induced collapse of WDs might be able to explain some of the rapidly evolving optical transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), as previously suggested. Based on the simulation results together with several assumptions, we confirm that the magnetar may account for the brighter side of some of observed FBOTs, while a combination of ejecta-envelope interaction which can be also followed by radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized along with the explosion might still explain the fainter branch even in the absence of magnetar formation.</description>

      <title>Persistent radio sources associated with fast radio bursts: Implications from magnetar progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rare association of three persistent radio sources (confirmed PRS1 and PRS2, candidate PRS3) with repeating fast radio bursts (FRB 20121102A, 20190520B, 20201124A) offers a unique probe into their magneto-ionic environments. PRSs are attributed to synchrotron emission from relativistic charged particles of magnetar wind nebula (MWN) powered by spin-down magnetohydrodynamic wind or internal magnetic field decay. Using a multizone hydrodynamic model, we track MWN evolution to constrain magnetar progenitor properties. For PRS1 and PRS2, we find an equipartition radius $R_\mathrm{eq} \sim 0.1 $ pc that is consistent with the radio scintillation estimates ($&gt; 0.03$ pc) and radio imaging limits ($&lt;0.7$ pc). This compact size favors low expansion speeds and large initial spin periods, $P_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$ ms, ruling out millisecond magnetar progenitors. Given $P_\mathrm{i} \gtrsim 10$ ms, a current size of $\sim 0.1$ pc, a supernova kinetic energy $E_\mathrm{ SN} \sim 10^{50}-10^{51}$ erg and an ejecta mass $M \sim 3-10 \; M_{\odot}$, the PRS age is $t \sim 10-10^{2}$ yr. PRSs with $t&gt;20$ years require an internal field ($B_\mathrm{int} \sim 10^{16}-10^{16.5}\;$G) with a decay timescale $t_\mathrm{d} \sim 10-10^{2.5}$ yr. The slowest field decay ($t_\mathrm{d,max} \sim 500$ yr) favors sub-energetic supernovae ($E_\mathrm{SN} \sim 10^{50}$ erg) with massive ejecta ($M \gtrsim 10\; M_{\odot}$) and low ionization fraction ($\sim 3\% $). For the sub-energetic scenario for the confirmed PRSs, we predict a cooling break at $100-150$ gigahertz at $20-40 \; \mu \text{Jy}$ and self-absorption near 200 megahertz at $180\; \mu \text{Jy}$. For PRS3, a rotation-powered MWN is viable only if $t \sim 10$ yr; an inverted spectrum beyond 150 gigahertz would rule out this scenario.</description>

      <title>Synchro-curvature description of {\gamma}-ray light curves and spectra of pulsars: concurrent fitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a concurrent fitting of spectra and light curves of the whole population of detected gamma-ray pulsars. Using a synchro-curvature model we compare our theoretical output with the observational data published in the Third Fermi Pulsar Catalog, which has significantly increased the number of known gamma-ray pulsars. Our model properly fits all the spectra and reproduces well a considerable fraction of light curves. Light curve fitting is carried out with two different techniques, whose strong points and caveats are discussed. We use a weighted reduced \{chi}^2 of light curves in time domain, and the Euclidean distance of the Fourier transform of the light curves, i.e. transforming the light curves to the frequency domain. The performance of both methods is found to be qualitatively similar, but individual best-fit solutions may differ. We also show that, in our model based on few effective parameters, the light curve fitting is basically insensitive to the timing and spectral parameters of the pulsar. Finally, we look for correlations between model and physical parameters, and recover trends found in previous studies but without any significant correlation involving geometrical parameters.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of BEACON to Ultra-High Energy Diffuse and Transient Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high energy neutrinos ($E&gt;10^{17}$ eV) can provide insight into the most powerful accelerators in the universe, however their flux is extremely low. The Beamforming Elevated Array for COsmic Neutrinos (BEACON) is a detector concept which efficiently achieves sensitivity to this flux by employing phased radio arrays on mountains, which search for the radio emission of up-going extensive air showers created by Earth-skimming tau neutrinos. Here, we calculate the point-source effective area of BEACON and characterize its sensitivity to transient neutrino fluences with both short ($&lt;15$ min) and long ($&gt; 1$ day) durations. Additionally, by integrating the effective area, we provide an updated estimate of the diffuse flux sensitivity. With just 100 stations, BEACON achieves sensitivity to short-duration transients such as nearby short gamma-ray bursts. With 1000 stations, BEACON achieves a sensitivity to long-duration transients, as well as the cosmogenic flux, ten times greater than existing experiments at 1 EeV. With an efficient design optimized for ultrahigh energy neutrinos, BEACON is capable of discovering the sources of neutrinos at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Spin-down Glitch in PSR J1835$-$1106</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of a spin-down glitch with a fractional frequency change of $\Delta\nu/\nu=-3.46(6)\times10^{-9}$ in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1835$-$1106 at MJD 55813, based on timing observations collected with the Nanshan 26-m and Parkes 64-m radio telescopes from January 2000 to July 2022. A comparison of the average pulse profiles within $\pm300$ d of the event reveals no significant morphological changes. We also estimate the angular velocity lag between the normal and superfluid components at the time of the glitch, showing that one of the superfluid glitch models is incompatible with PSR J1835$-$1106 due to its insufficient spin-down rate and angular velocity lag. The wind braking scenario offers a viable alternative, consistent with the observed spin-down behavior, glitch amplitude, and post-glitch recovery. High-cadence, high-sensitivity monitoring of similar events is essential to distinguish between internal (superfluid) and external (wind-related) glitch mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Complex Jet Dynamics in the Blazar 2021+317 through Multi-Epoch VLBI Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an investigation of the compact structure of the AGN 2021+317 based on multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at 15, 22, and 43 GHz in the period from 2013 through 2024. The VLBI images show a core-jet structure extended to the south, with two stationary components in the northern region, one of which likely to be the core of the source. We also detected two new moving jet components (S4 and S5) in the observations of 2021. Based on these observational findings, we analyzed two distinctive jet models, involving one or another stationary component mentioned above as the jet core. One model assumes a moderate bulk motion velocity, a wider viewing angle, and a lower Doppler factor, with the magnetic field energy density significantly dominating over non-thermal particle energy density. The other model involves a higher bulk motion velocity, a narrower viewing angle, and a higher Doppler factor, with an even greater dominance of magnetic field energy in the core. The position angle of the jet ridge line rotates counter-clockwise over the observed period. The apparent kinematics of the jet components is more consistent with a model of the precessing jet, which has recently completed the first half of the precession cycle. Our results provide constraints on the dynamic evolution of the jet and its interaction with the surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>XRISM View of the Newly Detected Galactic Source MAXI J1744-294</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transient Galactic source MAXI J1744-294 went into an outburst in 2025 for the very first time. We study the spectral properties of this source during this outburst using archival data from the XRISM satellite for both of its Resolve and Xtend instruments. We have analyzed the source during one epoch, on March 03, 2025, or MJD 60737, on which XRISM data were available. Using both phenomenological and physical model fitting approaches for continuum emissions, along with line emission and interstellar absorption models, we analyzed the spectral data in the broad 2-10 keV energy band. From our spectral analysis, we have found the existence of multiple iron lines, which are different components of the Fe XXV emission. These line complexes arise from two highly ionized plasmas with ionization rate ~ 10000 erg cm/s with distinct turbulent velocities: one broad (vturb ~ 2513 km/s) from hot gas at the inner accretion disk, and one narrow (vturb ~ 153 km/s ) scattered by nearby photoionized gas. The source is a moderately spinning black hole with a spin of 0.63-0.70, a mass of 5.7-10.1 Solar masses, and a disk inclination angle of 19-24 degrees. The spectral model fitted parameters suggest that the source is in the soft spectral state. The source is situated in a crowded field near the Galactic center, resulting in a very high hydrogen column density.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Collisional Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the effects of the neutrino collisional flavor instability (CFI) based on 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done using the sophisticated radiation-hydrodynamic code Fornax. We compare the growth rates of homogeneous CFI (hCFI) modes calculated by numerically solving the multi-group dispersion relation to those calculated using the monochromatic approximation. We find that the widely-used monochromatic approximation leads to incorrect growth rates} when applied in multi-group scenarios. As opposed to the $\sim10^5$ s$^{-1}$ values given by the monochromatic approximation, the actual growth rates of non-resonance multi-group hCFI are at most $\sim$200 s$^{-1}$ in all our models and they are too slow to affect CCSN outcomes. We adopt a BGK flavor conversion scheme in the simulations to include the effects of resonance-like hCFI. We find that the CCSN dynamics and neutrino emission properties are only weakly influenced, and the intrinsic stochasticity due to convection and neutrino-driven turbulence can naturally lead to comparable effects. Hence, our analysis of the non-resonance and resonance-like hCFI into CCSN simulations suggests that the effects of neutrino flavor conversion triggered by hCFI modes are in general small.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Radiation from Scalar Fields in Modified Gravity: A Comparison with Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze electromagnetic (EM) radiations arising from scalar fields predicted by modified gravity theories and compare these features with those induced by axion-like particles (ALPs). Scalar and axion fields couple differently to the EM field due to their distinct parity properties, $\phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ for scalar fields and $\phi F_{\mu\nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ for axions. Building on analytical methods developed for ALPs, this work presents a theoretical feasibility analysis that demonstrates how the scalar field in modified gravity could produce observable EM signatures from oscillating field configurations. We also show that resonance effects can amplify the EM radiation for the scalar field under specific conditions, and that the enhancement mechanisms depend on the coupling structure and the configuration of the background magnetic field. Resonance phenomena can accentuate the differences in signal strength and spectral features, potentially aiding future observations in distinguishing scalar fields from ALPs. This work provides a theoretical framework for studying generic pure and pseudo-scalar fields on an equal footing and suggests new avenues for observational tests of modified gravity scenarios alongside ALP models.</description>

      <title>ALP production from light primordial black holes: The role of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light primordial black holes (LPBHs) with masses in the range $10$~g~$\leq M_{\rm BH} \leq 10^9$~g, although they evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can play a significant role in the production of both dark matter and dark radiation. In particular, LPBHs can evaporate into light axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) with masses $m_a \lesssim$~MeV, contributing to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Additionally, heavy scalar particles known as {\em moduli}, predicted by string theory, can be produced both via Hawking evaporation and through amplification by a mechanism called {\em superradiant instability} in the case of spinning primordial black holes (PBHs). These moduli can subsequently decay into ALPs, further amplifying their abundance. In this work, we calculate the number density of ALPs in the presence of moduli enhanced by superradiance for Kerr PBHs. Using current limits on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from Planck satellite observations, we derive updated constraints on this scenario.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for stochastic particle acceleration, with application to magnetized turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of particle acceleration in turbulent plasmas is a topic of broad interest, which is making rapid progress thanks to dedicated, large-scale numerical experiments. The first part of this paper presents an effective theory of stochastic Fermi acceleration, which subsumes all forms of non-resonant acceleration in ideal electric fields and is applicable in generic settings. It combines an exact equation connecting the energization rate to the statistics of the velocity field with a statistical model of particle transport through the structures (i.e., the regions of strong velocity gradients). In a second part, this formalism is applied to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the scale-by-scale contributions to the advection and diffusion coefficients. Acceleration peaks on scales where particles can be trapped inside structures for an eddy turn-around time, or in intense structures associated with sharp bends of the magnetic field lines in large-amplitude turbulence (as reported earlier). These spatially inhomogeneous, rapid acceleration regimes pave the way for a rich phenomenology. We discuss the scalings obtained, their interpretation and show that the findings compare satisfactorily with existing numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear tails in black hole perturbations, arising from second-order effects, present a distinct departure from the well-known Price tail of linear theory. We present an analytical derivation of the power law indices and amplitudes for nonlinear tails stemming from outgoing sources, and validate these predictions to percent-level accuracy with numerical simulations. We then perform a perturbative analysis on the dynamical formation of nonlinear tails in a self-interacting scalar field model, wherein the nonlinear tails are sourced by a $\lambda \Phi^3$ cubic coupling. Due to cascading mode excitations and back-reactions, nonlinear tails with $t^{-l-1}$ power law are sourced in each harmonic mode, dominating the late time behavior of the scalar perturbations. In verification, we conducted numerical simulations of the self-interacting scalar model, including all real spherical harmonic (RSH) with $l\leq 4$ and their respective nonlinear couplings. We find general agreement between the predicted and numerical power law indices and amplitudes for the nonlinear tails, with the exception of $l=4$ modes, which display $t^{-4}$ power law instead of the predicted $t^{-5}$. This discrepancy is due to distortion in the source of the tails, which is caused by another nonlinear effect. These results establish nonlinear tails as universal features of black hole dynamics, with implications for gravitational wave astronomy: they may imprint observable signatures in merger remnants, offering novel probes of strong-field gravity and nonlinear mode couplings.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts and The Star Formation Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological evolution of the luminosity and redshift of FRBs. As is the case for all extragalactic sources, we are dealing with data that are truncated by observational selection effects, the most important being the flux limit, which introduces the so-called Eddington-Malmquist bias. In addition, for FRBs, there is a significant uncertainty in the redshifts obtained from the observed dispersion measures (DMs). To correct for the truncation we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian and Lynden-Bell methods, which give unbiased distributions of luminosities and redshifts and their cosmological evolution. To quantify the redshift uncertainty, we use a data set which accounts for uncertainties of contribution to the DM of the host galaxy, and DM uncertainties due to fluctuation in the intergalactic medium. This data, in addition to a mean redshift, gives the one-sigma errors. We construct three samples with lower, mean, and upper redshifts and apply the above methods to each. For the three samples, we find similar (1) $\sim 3\sigma$ evidence for luminosity evolution, (2) a luminosity function that can be fit by a simple broken power law, and (3) a comoving density formation rate that decreases rapidly with redshift unlike the cosmic star formation rate (SFR). This rate is similar to that of short gamma-ray bursts, which are believed to result from compact star mergers with a formation rate delayed relative to the SFR. This may further support the hypothesis that magnetars are the progenitors of FRBs.</description>

Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing their structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions.</description>

      <title>XRISM insights for interstellar Sulfur</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) provides the best spectral resolution with which to study Sulfur (S) K-shell photoabsorption features from the interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we demonstrate the high-signal detection of interstellar atomic SII K-beta absorption in the spectrum of X-ray binaries (XRBs) 4U 1630-472 and GX 340+0. The persistence of this feature across multiple instruments, targets, and flux states implies that it is interstellar in nature. We measure the SII Kbeta line centroid at 2470.8 +/- 1.1 eV after including systematic uncertainties. We also find that the most recently published high resolution SII absorption template requires a systematic energy scale shift of +7-8 eV, which is comparable to the level of disagreement among various atomic modeling procedures. The XRISM 300 ks observation of GX 340+0 provides unprecedented signal-to-noise in the S K region, and we find evidence of residual absorption from solid S in the spectra of GX 340+0. Absorption templates from three Fe-S compounds, troilite (FeS), pyrrhotite (Fe_7S_8) and pyrite (FeS_2), provide equally good fits to the residuals. Even though we are not able to distinguish among these three compounds, they provide equal estimates for the abundance of S locked in dust grains. Having accounted for both the gaseous and solid S in the GX 340+0 sightline provides us with a direct measurement of S depletion, which is 40% +/- 15%. Our depletion measurement provides an upper limit to the fraction of interstellar Fe bound in Fe-S compounds of &lt; 25%, which is consistent with prior studies of Fe-S compounds via Fe L-shell absorption. Both XRBs in this study are at a distance of approximately 11 kpc and on the opposite side of the Galactic disk, suggesting that this value could represent the average S depletion of the Milky Way when integrated across all phases of the ISM.</description>

Abstract: Real astrophysical lenses typically lack axisymmetry, necessitating the study of gravitational-wave (GW) lensing by elliptical mass distributions to accurately assess detectability and waveform interpretation. We investigate strong lensing using the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, which produces two or four images depending on the source's position relative to lens caustics. Employing a quasi-geometrical optics framework, we determine that the geometrical-optics approximation holds reliably for lens masses above approximately $10^5 \, M_\odot$ at GW frequencies relevant for ground-based detectors $(\sim 10^2 \,\text{Hz})$, though wave-optics effects become significant for lower masses or sources near caustics. Our waveform mismatch analysis demonstrates that the use of three-image templates significantly improves our ability to distinguish source signals, reducing mismatches from $O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^{-2})$, typically by factors between 1.5 and 5 compared to the standard two-image template model. At lens masses above $10^7 \, M_\odot$, diffraction effects become negligible for ground-based detectors, resulting in an additional mismatch reduction by a factor of approximately three. These findings highlight the critical need for multi-image templates in GW searches to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of accretion disk geometry in shaping black hole shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study black hole imaging in the context of geometrically thick accretion disks in Schwarzschild spacetime. By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness (characterized by the half-opening angle $\psi_0$) broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.</description>
