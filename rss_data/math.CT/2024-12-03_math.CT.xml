      <title>Approximation of graded bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an equivalence of categories established by Kapranov and Schechtman, we introduce, for each non-negative integer d, the category of connected bialgebras modulo d+1. We show that these categories fit into an inverse system of categories whose inverse limit category is equivalent to the category of connected bialgebras. In addition, we extend the notion of approximation of connected bialgebras to those that are not necessarily generated in degree 1 and show that, for connected bialgebras in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a Hopf algebra, approximation is compatible with cocycle twisting.</description>

      <title>Categorical approach to graph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and study a natural category of graph limits. The objects are pairs $(\pi,\mu)$, where $\pi$ (the distribution of vertices) is an abstract probability measure on some abstract measurable space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ and $\mu$ (the distribution of edges) is an abstract finite measure on the square $(X,\mathcal{A})^2$. Morphisms are random maps between the underlying measurable spaces which preserve the distribution of vertices as well as the distribution of edges. We also define a convergence notion (inspired by s-convergence) for sequences of graph limits. We apply tools from category theory to prove the compactness of the space of all graph limits.</description>

      <title>The Langlands formula and perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ and Weyl group $W$ we consider the category $\text{Perv}(W \backslash \mathfrak{h})$ of perverse sheaves on $W \backslash \mathfrak{h}$ smooth w.r.t. the natural stratification. We construct a category $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ such that $\text{Perv}(W\backslash \mathfrak{h})$ is identified with the category of functors from $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ to vector spaces. Objects of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ are labelled by standard parabolic subalgebras in $\mathfrak{g}$. It has morphisms analogous to the operations of parabolic induction (Eisenstein series) and restriction (constant term) of automorphic forms. In particular, the Langlands formula for the constant term of an Eisenstein series has a counterpart in the form of an identity in $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$. We define $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ as the category of $W$-invariants (in an appropriate sense) in the category $Q$ describing perverse sheaves on $\mathfrak{h}$ smooth w.r.t. the root arrangement. This matches, in an interesting way, the definition of $W \backslash \mathfrak{h}$ itself as the spectrum of the algebra of $W$-invariants.</description>

      <title>Generating Higher Identity Proofs in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finster and Mimram have defined a dependent type theory called CaTT, which describes the structure of omega-categories. Types in homotopy type theory with their higher identity types form weak omega-groupoids, so they are in particular weak omega-categories. In this article, we show that this principle makes homotopy type theory into a model of CaTT, by defining a translation principle that interprets an operation on the cell of an omega-category as an operation on higher identity types. We then illustrate how this translation allows to leverage several mechanisation principles that are available in CaTT, to reduce the proof effort required to derive results about the structure of identity types, such as the existence of an Eckmann-Hilton cell.</description>

      <title>Remarks on cotorsion theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11208v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present some results from classical homological algebra using the language of cotorsion theories in abelian categories. The results are a couple of foundational facts about homological dimension, the Kunneth formula and the universal coefficients formula. We also present some ''totally acyclic'' cotorsion theories and revisit some results from the literature concerning resolutions of chain complexes in abelian categories.</description>

      <title>CP$^{\infty}$ and beyond: 2-categorical dilation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of extending the insights and techniques of categorical quantum mechanics to infinite-dimensional systems was considered in (Coecke and Heunen, 2016). In that work the $\mathrm{CP}^{\infty}$-construction, which recovers the category of Hilbert spaces and quantum operations from the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps, was defined. Here we show that by a `horizontal categorification' of the $\mathrm{CP}^{\infty}$-construction, one can recover the category of all von Neumann algebras and channels (normal unital completely positive maps) from the 2-category $[W^*]$ of von Neumann algebras, bimodules and intertwiners. As an application, we extend Choi's characterisation of extremal channels between finite-dimensional matrix algebras to a characterisation of extremal channels between arbitrary von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>On Meta-Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern generative language models are capable of interpreting input strings as instructions, or prompts, and carry out tasks based on them. Many approaches to prompting and pre-training these models involve the automated generation of these prompts: meta-prompting, or prompting to obtain prompts. We propose a theoretical framework based on category theory to generalize and describe them. This framework is flexible enough to account for stochasticity, and allows us to obtain formal results around task agnosticity and equivalence of various meta-prompting approaches. Experimentally, we test our framework in two active areas of model research: creativity and ideation. We find that user preference strongly favors (p &lt; 0.01) the prompts generated under meta-prompting, as well as their corresponding outputs, over a series of hardcoded baseline prompts that include the original task definition. Using our framework, we argue that meta-prompting is more effective than basic prompting at generating desirable outputs.</description>
