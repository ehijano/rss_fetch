      <title>Probing the Three-dimension Emission Source and Neutron Skin via $\pi$-$\pi$ Correlations in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Richardson-Lucy algorithm is applied to reconstruct the three-dimensional source function of identical pions from their two-particle correlation functions. The algorithm's performance is first evaluated through simulations with Gaussian-type initial source functions. Its imaging quality and robustness are further demonstrated with experimental data from Au+Au collisions at 1.23 A GeV, collected by the HADES Collaboration. Additionally, using UrQMD simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at 1.5 A GeV, we show that the deblurred source functions exhibit sensitivity to the initial neutron skin thickness of the colliding nuclei. This highlights the potential of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm as a tool for probing the neutron density distribution in heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>Computing nuclear response functions with time-dependent coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute nuclear response functions by solving the time-dependent A-body Schr\"odinger equation, recording the time-dependent transition moment and extracting spectral information via Fourier transforms. The solution of the time-dependent many-body problem accounts for correlations on top of the mean field by taking advantage of a time-dependent formulation of coupled-cluster theory. As a validation, we focus on electric dipole transitions in $^4$He and $^{16}$O and compare moments of the response function distribution to the results of an equivalent static framework, finding negligible discrepancies. We investigate how proton and neutron densities evolve in time, and we see the traditional picture of soft and giant dipole resonances as collective oscillations of protons and neutrons emerging from our calculations in $^{16}$O and $^{24}$O. This method also allows us to investigate the behavior of the nucleus in the presence of a strong electric field. In that regime, the behavior of the system becomes chaotic. Qualitatively, the spectral information obtained in this limit is in line with previous time-dependent mean-field results.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling for Identified Mesons and Baryons: Insights into Medium Transport Properties, Equation of State and Hadronic Re-scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling functions for the centrality and transverse momentum dependence of \(v_2(p_T,\text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T,\text{cent})\) are constructed for identified mesons and baryons in Pb+Pb (\(\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76,\ 5.02\)~TeV), Xe+Xe (5.44~TeV), and Au+Au (0.2~TeV) collisions. These species-resolved functions capture the interplay of initial geometry, viscous attenuation, radial flow, partonic energy loss, and hadronic re-scattering across both flow- and quenching-dominated regimes. The systematic growth of the radial-flow parameter \(\zeta_{\rm rf}\) with multiplicity and beam energy provides direct empirical constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of hot QCD matter. The extracted parameters also yield differential constraints on the specific shear viscosity \(\eta/s\), the jet-quenching parameter \(\hat{q}\), and late-stage hadronic dynamics. LHC systems exhibit low \(\eta/s\), strong radial flow, and negligible re-scattering at high energy density, whereas Au+Au at RHIC energy shows even lower \(\eta/s\), weaker radial flow, finite re-scattering, and reduced energy density. The coexistence of strong radial flow at low \(p_T\) and significant jet suppression at high \(p_T\) emerges as a defining hallmark of QGP formation, establishing the framework as a quantitative probe of QGP transport properties and EOS stiffness.</description>

      <title>Imaging nuclear shape through anisotropic and radial flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most atomic nuclei exhibit ellipsoidal shapes characterized by quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\gamma$, and sometimes even a pear-like octupole deformation $\beta_3$. The STAR experiment introduced a new "imaging-by-smashing" technique [arXiv:2401.06625, arXiv:2501.16071] to image the nuclear global shape by colliding nuclei at ultra-relativistic speeds and analyzing outgoing debris. Features of nuclear shape manifest in collective observables like anisotropic flow $v_n$ and radial flow via mean transverse momentum $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$. We present new measurements of the variances of $v_n$ ($n=2$, 3, and 4) and $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$, and the covariance of $v_n^2$ with $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$, in collisions of highly deformed $^{238}$U and nearly spherical $^{197}$Au. Ratios of these observables between the two systems effectively suppress common final-state effects, isolating the strong impact of uranium's deformation. By comparing results with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model calculations, we extract $\beta_{2\mathrm{U}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{U}}$ values consistent with those deduced from low-energy nuclear structure measurements. Measurements of $v_3$ and its correlation with $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ also provide the first experimental suggestion of a possible octupole deformation for $^{238}$U. These findings provide significant support for using high-energy collisions to explore nuclear shapes on femtosecond timescales, with implications for both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma studies.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration in the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation for nuclear beta decay: The effect of angular-momentum projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the effects of symmetry restoration on nuclear beta decay within the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). We employ the proton-neutron finite-amplitude method (pnFAM) to compute transition amplitudes, and perform angular-momentum projection both after variation and after the QRPA to restore rotational symmetry. Exact projection reduces the calculated beta decay half-lives from those that use the needle approximation by up to 60%, and even more when taking the effects of projection on the ground-state energy into account.</description>
