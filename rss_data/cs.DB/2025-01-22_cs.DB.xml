      <title>Reliable Text-to-SQL with Adaptive Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language interfaces for databases, particularly in text-to-SQL conversion. However, current approaches often generate unreliable outputs when faced with ambiguity or insufficient context. We present Reliable Text-to-SQL (RTS), a novel framework that enhances query generation reliability by incorporating abstention and human-in-the-loop mechanisms. RTS focuses on the critical schema linking phase, which aims to identify the key database elements needed for generating SQL queries. It autonomously detects potential errors during the answer generation process and responds by either abstaining or engaging in user interaction. A vital component of RTS is the Branching Point Prediction (BPP) which utilizes statistical conformal techniques on the hidden layers of the LLM model for schema linking, providing probabilistic guarantees on schema linking accuracy. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and reliability. Our findings highlight the potential of combining transparent-box LLMs with human-in-the-loop processes to create more robust natural language interfaces for databases. For the BIRD benchmark, our approach achieves near-perfect schema linking accuracy, autonomously involving a human when needed. Combined with query generation, we demonstrate that near-perfect schema linking and a small query generation model can almost match SOTA accuracy achieved with a model orders of magnitude larger than the one we use.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize and study the problem of repairing database queries based on user feedback in the form of a collection of labeled examples. We propose a framework based on the notion of a proximity pre-order, and we investigate and compare query repairs for conjunctive queries (CQs) using different such pre-orders. The proximity pre-orders we consider are based on query containment and on distance metrics for CQs.</description>

      <title>TigerVector: Supporting Vector Search in Graph Databases for Advanced RAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce TigerVector, a system that integrates vector search and graph query within TigerGraph, a Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) native graph database. We extend the vertex attribute type with the embedding type. To support fast vector search, we devise an MPP index framework that interoperates efficiently with the graph engine. The graph query language GSQL is enhanced to support vector type expressions and enable query compositions between vector search results and graph query blocks. These advancements elevate the expressive power and analytical capabilities of graph databases, enabling seamless fusion of unstructured and structured data in ways previously unattainable. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate TigerVector's hybrid search capability, scalability, and superior performance compared to other graph databases (including Neo4j and Amazon Neptune) and a highly optimized specialized vector database (Milvus). TigerVector was integrated into TigerGraph v4.2, the latest release of TigerGraph, in December 2024.</description>

      <title>Understanding User Preference -- Comparison between Linear and Directional Top-K Query results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates user preferences for Linear Top-k Queries and Directional Top-k Queries, two methods for ranking results in multidimensional datasets. While Linear Queries prioritize weighted sums of attributes, Directional Queries aim to deliver more balanced results by incorporating the spatial relationship between data points and a user-defined preference line. The study explores how preferences for these methods vary across different contexts by focusing on two real-world topics: used cars (e-commerce domain) and football players (personal interest domain). A user survey involving 106 participants was conducted to evaluate preferences, with results visualized as scatter plots for comparison. The findings reveal a significant preference for directional queries in the used cars topic, where balanced results align better with user goals. In contrast, preferences in the football players topic were more evenly distributed, influenced by user expertise and familiarity with the domain. Additionally, the study demonstrates that the two specific topics selected for this research exhibit significant differences in their impact on user preferences. This research reveals authentic user preferences, highlighting the practical utility of Directional Queries for lifestyle-related applications and the subjective nature of preferences in specialized domains. These insights contribute to advancing personalized database technologies, guiding the development of more user-centric ranking systems.</description>

      <title>Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information.
  In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve a strong performance with 67.41\% on BIRD benchmark (dev) without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</description>

      <title>Reviewing Uses of Regulatory Compliance Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to deliver their services and products to customers, organizations need to manage numerous business processes. One important consideration thereby lies in the adherence to regulations such as laws, guidelines, or industry standards. In order to monitor adherence of their business processes to regulations - in other words, their regulatory compliance - organizations make use of various techniques that draw on process execution data of IT systems that support these processes. While previous research has investigated conformance checking, an operation of process mining, for the domains in which it is applied, its operationalization of regulations, the techniques being used, and the presentation of results produced, other techniques for compliance monitoring, which we summarize as compliance checking techniques, have not yet been investigated in a structural manner. To this end, this work presents a systematic literature review on uses of regulatory compliance monitoring of business processes, thereby offering insights into the various techniques being used, their application and the results they generate. We highlight commonalities and differences between the approaches and find that various steps are performed manually; we also provide further impulses for research on compliance monitoring and its use in practice.</description>

      <title>Lossless Compression of Vector IDs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search for vectors relies on indexes that are most often accessed from RAM. Therefore, storage is the factor limiting the size of the database that can be served from a machine. Lossy vector compression, i.e., embedding quantization, has been applied extensively to reduce the size of indexes. However, for inverted file and graph-based indices, auxiliary data such as vector ids and links (edges) can represent most of the storage cost. We introduce and evaluate lossless compression schemes for these cases. These approaches are based on asymmetric numeral systems or wavelet trees that exploit the fact that the ordering of ids is irrelevant within the data structures. In some settings, we are able to compress the vector ids by a factor 7, with no impact on accuracy or search runtime. On billion-scale datasets, this results in a reduction of 30% of the index size. Furthermore, we show that for some datasets, these methods can also compress the quantized vector codes losslessly, by exploiting sub-optimalities in the original quantization algorithm. The source code for our approach available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/vector_db_id_compression.</description>

      <title>Picachv: Formally Verified Data Use Policy Enforcement for Secure Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the proper use of sensitive data in analytics under complex privacy policies is an increasingly critical challenge. Many existing approaches lack portability, verifiability, and scalability across diverse data processing frameworks. We introduce Picachv, a novel security monitor that automatically enforces data use policies. It works on relational algebra as an abstraction for program semantics, enabling policy enforcement on query plans generated by programs during execution. This approach simplifies analysis across diverse analytical operations and supports various front-end query languages. By formalizing both data use policies and relational algebra semantics in Coq, we prove that Picachv correctly enforces policies. Picachv also leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enhance trust in runtime, providing provable policy compliance to stakeholders that the analytical tasks comply with their data use policies. We integrated Picachv into Polars, a state-of-the-art data analytics framework, and evaluate its performance using the TPC-H benchmark. We also apply our approach to real-world use cases. Our work demonstrates the practical application of formal methods in securing data analytics, addressing key challenges.</description>

      <title>Practical and Ready-to-Use Methodology to Assess the re-identification Risk in Anonymized Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To prove that a dataset is sufficiently anonymized, many privacy policies suggest that a re-identification risk assessment be performed, but do not provide a precise methodology for doing so, leaving the industry alone with the problem. This paper proposes a practical and ready-to-use methodology for re-identification risk assessment, the originality of which is manifold: (1) it is the first to follow well-known risk analysis methods (e.g. EBIOS) that have been used in the cybersecurity field for years, which consider not only the ability to perform an attack, but also the impact such an attack can have on an individual; (2) it is the first to qualify attributes and values of attributes with e.g. degree of exposure, as known real-world attacks mainly target certain types of attributes and not others.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal characterisation of underwater noise through semantic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater noise pollution from human activities, particularly shipping, has been recognised as a serious threat to marine life. The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Constant Optimization Driven Database System Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logic bugs are bugs that can cause database management systems (DBMSs) to silently produce incorrect results for given queries. Such bugs are severe, because they can easily be overlooked by both developers and users, and can cause applications that rely on the DBMSs to malfunction. In this work, we propose Constant-Optimization-Driven Database Testing (CODDTest) as a novel approach for detecting logic bugs in DBMSs. This method draws inspiration from two well-known optimizations in compilers: constant folding and constant propagation. Our key insight is that for a certain database state and query containing a predicate, we can apply constant folding on the predicate by replacing an expression in the predicate with a constant, anticipating that the results of this predicate remain unchanged; any discrepancy indicates a bug in the DBMS. We evaluated CODDTest on five mature and extensively-tested DBMSs-SQLite, MySQL, CockroachDB, DuckDB, and TiDB-and found 45 unique, previously unknown bugs in them. Out of these, 24 are unique logic bugs. Our manual analysis of the state-of-the-art approaches indicates that 11 logic bugs are detectable only by CODDTest. We believe that CODDTest is easy to implement, and can be widely adopted in practice.</description>

      <title>Dialect2SQL: A Novel Text-to-SQL Dataset for Arabic Dialects with a Focus on Moroccan Darija</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of converting natural language questions (NLQs) into executable SQL queries, known as text-to-SQL, has gained significant interest in recent years, as it enables non-technical users to interact with relational databases. Many benchmarks, such as SPIDER and WikiSQL, have contributed to the development of new models and the evaluation of their performance. In addition, other datasets, like SEDE and BIRD, have introduced more challenges and complexities to better map real-world scenarios. However, these datasets primarily focus on high-resource languages such as English and Chinese. In this work, we introduce Dialect2SQL, the first large-scale, cross-domain text-to-SQL dataset in an Arabic dialect. It consists of 9,428 NLQ-SQL pairs across 69 databases in various domains. Along with SQL-related challenges such as long schemas, dirty values, and complex queries, our dataset also incorporates the complexities of the Moroccan dialect, which is known for its diverse source languages, numerous borrowed words, and unique expressions. This demonstrates that our dataset will be a valuable contribution to both the text-to-SQL community and the development of resources for low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>A Common Ancestor of PDL, Conjunctive Queries, and Unary Negation First-order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study UCPDL+, a family of expressive logics rooted in Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) with converse (CPDL) and universal modality (UCPDL). In terms of expressive power, UCPDL+ strictly contains PDL extended with intersection and converse (a.k.a. ICPDL), as well as Conjunctive Queries (CQ), Conjunctive Regular Path Queries (CRPQ), or some known extensions thereof (Regular Queries and CQPDL). Further, it is equivalent to the extension of the unary-negation fragment of first-order logic (UNFO) with unary transitive closure, which we denote by UNFO*, which in turn strictly contains a previously studied extension of UNFO with regular expressions known as UNFO^reg.
  We investigate the expressive power, indistinguishability via bisimulations, satisfiability, and model checking for UCPDL+ and CPDL+. We argue that natural subclasses of CPDL+ can be defined in terms of the tree-width of the underlying graphs of the formulas. We show that the class of CPDL+ formulas of tree-width 2 is equivalent to ICPDL, and that it also coincides with CPDL+ formulas of tree-width 1. However, beyond tree-width 2, incrementing the tree-width strictly increases the expressive power. We characterize the expressive power for every class of fixed tree-width formulas in terms of a bisimulation game with pebbles. Based on this characterization, we show that CPDL+ has a tree-like model property. We prove that the satisfiability problem for UCPDL+ is decidable in 2ExpTime, coinciding with the complexity of ICPDL. As a consequence, the satisfiability problem for UNFO* is shown to be 2ExpTime-complete as well. We also exhibit classes for which satisfiability is reduced to ExpTime. Finally, we establish that the model checking problem for fixed tree-width formulas is in PTime, contrary to the full class CPDL+.</description>

      <title>Toward Effective Digraph Representation Learning: A Magnetic Adaptive Propagation based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $q$-parameterized magnetic Laplacian serves as the foundation of directed graph (digraph) convolution, enabling this kind of digraph neural network (MagDG) to encode node features and structural insights by complex-domain message passing. As a generalization of undirected methods, MagDG shows superior capability in modeling intricate web-scale topology. Despite the great success achieved by existing MagDGs, limitations still exist: (1) Hand-crafted $q$: The performance of MagDGs depends on selecting an appropriate $q$-parameter to construct suitable graph propagation equations in the complex domain. This parameter tuning, driven by downstream tasks, limits model flexibility and significantly increases manual effort. (2) Coarse Message Passing: Most approaches treat all nodes with the same complex-domain propagation and aggregation rules, neglecting their unique digraph contexts. This oversight results in sub-optimal performance. To address the above issues, we propose two key techniques: (1) MAP is crafted to be a plug-and-play complex-domain propagation optimization strategy in the context of digraph learning, enabling seamless integration into any MagDG to improve predictions while enjoying high running efficiency. (2) MAP++ is a new digraph learning framework, further incorporating a learnable mechanism to achieve adaptively edge-wise propagation and node-wise aggregation in the complex domain for better performance. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that MAP enjoys flexibility for it can be incorporated with any MagDG, and scalability as it can deal with web-scale digraphs. MAP++ achieves SOTA predictive performance on 4 different downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward Scalable Graph Unlearning: A Node Influence Maximization based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning, as a pivotal technology for enhancing model robustness and data privacy, has garnered significant attention in prevalent web mining applications, especially in thriving graph-based scenarios. However, most existing graph unlearning (GU) approaches face significant challenges due to the intricate interactions among web-scale graph elements during the model training: (1) The gradient-driven node entanglement hinders the complete knowledge removal in response to unlearning requests; (2) The billion-level graph elements in the web scenarios present inevitable scalability issues. To break the above limitations, we open up a new perspective by drawing a connection between GU and conventional social influence maximization. To this end, we propose Node Influence Maximization (NIM) through the decoupled influence propagation model and fine-grained influence function in a scalable manner, which is crafted to be a plug-and-play strategy to identify potential nodes affected by unlearning entities. This approach enables offline execution independent of GU, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into most GU methods to improve their unlearning performance. Based on this, we introduce Scalable Graph Unlearning (SGU) as a new fine-tuned framework, which balances the forgetting and reasoning capability of the unlearned model by entity-specific optimizations. Extensive experiments on 14 datasets, including large-scale ogbn-papers100M, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, NIM enhances the forgetting capability of most GU methods, while SGU achieves comprehensive SOTA performance and maintains scalability.</description>

      <title>Cache Coherence Over Disaggregated Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol by introducing lazy latch-release and invalidation messages, thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.</description>

      <title>Semantic Tree-Width and Path-Width of Conjunctive Regular Path Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01679v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the problem of whether a query is equivalent to a query of tree-width $k$ is decidable, for the class of Unions of Conjunctive Regular Path Queries with two-way navigation (UC2RPQs). A previous result by Barcel\'o, Romero, and Vardi [SIAM Journal on Computing, 2016] has shown decidability for the case $k=1$, and here we extend this result showing that decidability in fact holds for any arbitrary $k\geq 1$. The algorithm is in 2ExpSpace, but for the restricted but practically relevant case where all regular expressions of the query are of the form $a^*$ or $(a_1 + \dotsb + a_n)$ we show that the complexity of the problem drops to $\Pi^P_2$.
  We also investigate the related problem of approximating a UC2RPQ by queries of small tree-width. We exhibit an algorithm which, for any fixed number $k$, builds the maximal under-approximation of tree-width $k$ of a UC2RPQ. The maximal under-approximation of tree-width $k$ of a query $q$ is a query $q'$ of tree-width $k$ which is contained in $q$ in a maximal and unique way, that is, such that for every query $q''$ of tree-width $k$, if $q''$ is contained in $q$ then $q''$ is also contained in $q'$.
  Our approach is shown to be robust, in the sense that it allows also to test equivalence with queries of a given path-width, it also covers the previously known result for $k=1$, and it allows to test for equivalence of whether a (one-way) UCRPQ is equivalent to a UCRPQ of a given tree-width (or path-width).</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation for Relational Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation mechanisms typically assume a single-source table. In practice, data is often distributed across multiple tables with relationships across tables. In this paper, we introduce the first-of-its-kind algorithm that can be combined with any existing DP mechanisms to generate synthetic relational databases. Our algorithm iteratively refines the relationship between individual synthetic tables to minimize their approximation errors in terms of low-order marginal distributions while maintaining referential integrity. This algorithm eliminates the need to flatten a relational database into a master table (saving space), operates efficiently (saving time), and scales effectively to high-dimensional data. We provide both DP and theoretical utility guarantees for our algorithm. Through numerical experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving fidelity to the original data.</description>

      <title>OpenFGL: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Federated Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) is a promising distributed training paradigm for graph neural networks across multiple local systems without direct data sharing. This approach inherently involves large-scale distributed graph processing, which closely aligns with the challenges and research focuses of graph-based data systems. Despite the proliferation of FGL, the diverse motivations from real-world applications, spanning various research backgrounds and settings, pose a significant challenge to fair evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose OpenFGL, a unified benchmark designed for the primary FGL scenarios: Graph-FL and Subgraph-FL. Specifically, OpenFGL includes 42 graph datasets from 18 application domains, 8 federated data simulation strategies that emphasize different graph properties, and 5 graph-based downstream tasks. Additionally, it offers 18 recently proposed SOTA FGL algorithms through a user-friendly API, enabling a thorough comparison and comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Our empirical results demonstrate the capabilities of FGL while also highlighting its potential limitations, providing valuable insights for future research in this growing field, particularly in fostering greater interdisciplinary collaboration between FGL and data systems.</description>

      <title>BEAVER: An Enterprise Benchmark for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing text-to-SQL benchmarks have largely been constructed from web tables with human-generated question-SQL pairs. LLMs typically show strong results on these benchmarks, leading to a belief that LLMs are effective at text-to-SQL tasks. However, how these results transfer to enterprise settings is unclear because tables in enterprise databases might differ substantially from web tables in structure and content. To contend with this problem, we introduce a new dataset BEAVER, the first enterprise text-to-SQL benchmark sourced from real private enterprise data warehouses. This dataset includes natural language queries and their correct SQL statements, which we collected from actual query logs. We then benchmark off-the-shelf LLMs on this dataset. LLMs perform poorly, even when augmented with standard prompt engineering and RAG techniques. We identify three main reasons for the poor performance: (1) schemas of enterprise tables are more complex than the schemas in public data, resulting in SQL-generation tasks intrinsically harder; (2) business-oriented questions are often more complex, requiring joins over multiple tables, aggregations, and nested queries; (3) public LLMs cannot train on private enterprise data warehouses that are not publicly accessible, and therefore it is difficult for the model to learn to solve (1) and (2). We believe BEAVER will facilitate future research in building text-to-SQL systems that perform better in enterprise settings.</description>
