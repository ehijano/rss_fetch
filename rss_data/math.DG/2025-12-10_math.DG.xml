      <title>The higher-order Henneberg-type minimal surfaces family in $\mathbb{R}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a higher-order Henneberg-type minimal surfaces family using the generalized Weierstrass--Enneper representation in four-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^4$. We derive explicit parametric equations for the surface and determine its differential geometric characteristics, including the normal vector fields $\mathbf{n}_1$ and $\mathbf{n}_2$, as well as the Gauss curvature. Furthermore, by projecting these parametric forms from four to three dimensions, we generate visualizations that reveal the geometric structure of the Henneberg-type minimal surface. In addition, we examine the integral-free form and derive the corresponding algebraic function for this family of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Chern Conjecture on Minimal Willmore Hypersurfaces with Constant Scalar Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for an $n$-dimensional closed minimal Willmore hypersurface $M^n$ with constant scalar curvature in the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$, the squared norm $S$ of the second fundamental form of $M^n$ satisfies $S\geqslant n+\frac{4n+9-\sqrt{4 n^{2}+60 n+81}}{2}$ if $S&gt;n$. This proves, in the approximate sense, the Chern conjecture about the second gap ($S\geqslant 2n$ if $S&gt;n$), which will be fully verified under a further inequality condition about the 4-th mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Mixed Hessian inequalities on Hermitian manifolds and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\omega)$ be a compact Hermitian manifold of complex dimension $n$. In this paper we establish a Ko\l odziej-Nguyen type weak convergence theorem of complex Hessian operators. Utilizing this result, we prove a general mixed Hessian inequality with respect to a background Hermitian metric, covering both local and global case. As an application, we prove the existence of bounded solutions of complex Hessian equations where the right-hand side measure is well dominated by capacities.</description>

      <title>Brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study \emph{brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces} in Newtonian and relativistic spacetimes. Starting from the classical cycloidal brachistochrone in a constant gravitational field, we construct a Newtonian ``brachistochrone-ruled worldsheet'' whose rulings are time-minimizing trajectories between pairs of endpoints. We then generalize this construction to stationary Lorentzian spacetimes by exploiting the reduction of arrival-time functionals to Finsler- or Jacobi-type length functionals on a spatial manifold. In this framework, relativistic brachistochrones arise as geodesics of an associated Finsler structure, and brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces are timelike surfaces ruled by these time-minimizing worldlines. We work out explicit examples in Minkowski spacetime and in the Schwarzschild exterior: in the flat case, for a bounded-speed time functional, the brachistochrones are straight timelike lines and a simple family of brachistochrone-ruled surfaces turns out to be totally geodesic; in the Schwarzschild case, we show how coordinate-time minimization at fixed energy reduces to geodesics of a Jacobi metric on the spatial slice, and outline a numerical scheme for constructing brachistochrone-ruled timelike surfaces. Finally, we discuss basic geometric properties of such surfaces and identify natural Jacobi fields along the rulings.</description>

      <title>Dubrovin duality for open Hurwitz flat F-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Dubrovin dual of a Hurwitz Frobenius manifold extends naturally to an F-manifold with compatible flat connection on the universal curve, in the sense of the open WDVV equations. A similar result is proven for the Frobenius manifold itself in arXiv:2503.09258 . This equips the universal curve with two F-manifolds with compatible flat structure, and we study their duality. We show that they combine into a bi-flat F-manifold. Conditions on open WDVV solutions imposed in previous work are retrieved in this setting, thus providing them with a geometrical meaning. Finally, explicit examples are computed. For Saito Frobenius manifolds of types $A$ and $D$, the extended prepotentials coincide with open WDVV solutions computed independently, whereas even the existence of the solution in type $E$ had not been previously discussed. On the other hand, new non-homogeneous solutions are constructed by duality.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hodge Theorem: curl and asymmetric pseudodifferential projections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit.</description>

      <title>BGG Sequences -- A Riemannian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BGG resolutions and generalized BGG resolutions from representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras have been generalized to sequences of invariant differential operators on manifolds endowed with a geometric structure belonging to the family of parabolic geometries. Two of these structures, conformal structures and projective structures, occur as weakenings of a Riemannian metric respectively of a specified torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle. In particular, one obtains BGG sequences on open subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ as very special cases of the construction. It turned out that several examples of the latter sequences are of interest in applied mathematics, since they can be used to construct numerical methods to study operators relevant for elasticity theory, numerical relativity and related fields.
  This article is intended to provide an intermediate level between BGG sequences for parabolic geometries and the case of domains in $\mathbb R^n$. We provide a construction of conformal BGG sequences on Riemannian manifolds and of projective BGG sequences on manifolds endowed with a volume preserving linear connection on their tangent bundle. These constructions do not need any input from parabolic geometries. Except from standard differential geometry methods the only deeper input comes from representation theory. So one can either view the results as a simplified version of the constructions for parabolic geometries in an explicit form. Alternatively, one can view them as providing an extension of the simplified constructions for domains in $\Bbb R^n$ to general Riemannian manifolds or to manifolds endowed with an appropriate connection on the tangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff Stability of the Cut Locus Under $C^2$-Perturbations of the Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the stability with respect to the Hausdorff metric $d_H$ of the cut locus $\mathrm{Cut}(p, \mathfrak{g})$ of a point $p$ in a compact Riemannian manifold $(M, \mathfrak{g})$ under $C^2$ perturbation of the metric. Specifically, given a sequence of metrics $\mathfrak{g}_i$ on $M$, converging to $\mathfrak{g}$ in the $C^2$ topology, and a sequence of points $p_i$ in $M$, converging to $p$, we show that $\lim_i d_{H}\left( \mathrm{Cut}(p_i, \mathfrak{g}_i), \mathrm{Cut}(p, \mathfrak{g}) \right) = 0$. Along the way, we also prove the continuous dependence of the cut time map on the metric.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality, and a curvature-driven pre-compactness result. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>Oriented Grassmannian Bundle, Normal Curvature Reduction, and Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a smooth closed orientable submanifold $M \subset \mathbb{R}^D$ with narrow cycles. We embed $M$ into a scaled oriented Grassmannian bundle via the Gauss map in order to enlarge the scale of these cycles. Under mild assumptions, we show that this embedding reduces the normal curvature of the embedded submanifold in directions where the original normal curvature is large. For smooth closed hypersurfaces, we further show that this construction increases the distance between antipodal points of narrow cycles for fixed volume.
  We then obtain an explicit range of radii for which the ambient \v{C}ech complex on this Grassmannian bundle is homotopy equivalent to the embedded manifold, yielding lower bounds on the scales at which the \v{C}ech filtration recovers the homology of $M$. Since the distance induced by the embedding depends on both positions and oriented tangent spaces, we work with Whitney $C^1$ convergence of embeddings and prove that the associated \v{C}ech persistent homology is stable with respect to the interleaving distance. Finally, we describe a procedure for computing a distance matrix for a finite subset with respect to this embedding and illustrate the construction on several examples, including an approximate quasi-halo orbit in the Saturn--Enceladus system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an information-theoretic framework for smooth structures on topological manifolds, replacing coordinate charts with small-scale entropy data of local probability probes. A concise set of axioms identifies admissible coordinate functions and reconstructs a smooth atlas directly from the quadratic entropy response. We prove that this entropy-smooth structure is equivalent to the classical smooth structure, stable under perturbations, and compatible with products, submanifolds, immersions, and diffeomorphisms. This establishes smoothness as an information-theoretic phenomenon and forms the foundational layer of a broader program linking entropy, diffusion, and differential geometry.</description>

Abstract: We prove the transitivity of real Anosov diffeomorphisms, which are Anosov diffeomorphisms where stable and unstable spaces decompose into a continuous sum of invariant one-dimensional sub-spaces with uniform contraction/expansion over the ambient manifold. We prove that if a stable/unstable curve has a well-defined length in a conformal hyperbolic distance, then it has a globally defined holonomy. We exhibit a conformal hyperbolic distance with well-defined length of stable/unstable curves for each real Anosov diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. III: Poisson brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, under suitable conditions, finite-dimensional systems describing invariant solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) inherit local Hamiltonian operators through the mechanism of invariant reduction, which applies uniformly to point, contact, and higher symmetries. The inherited operators endow the reduced systems with Poisson bivectors that relate constants of motion to symmetries. Applying the same mechanism to invariant conservation laws, we further show that the induced Poisson brackets agree with those of the original systems, up to sign. This is illustrated by two examples in which the inherited Poisson brackets and inherited constants of motion yield integrability of the reduced systems.</description>
