      <title>A New Class of Geometrically Defined Hypergraphs Arising from the Hadwiger Nelson Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a famous problem in geometric graph theory to find the chromatic number of the unit distance graph on Euclidean space; it remains unsolved. A theorem of Erdos and De-Bruijn simplifies this problem to finding the maximum chromatic number of a finite unit distance graph. Via a construction built on sequential finite graphs obtained from a generalization of this theorem, we have found a class of geometrically defined hypergraphs of arbitrarily large edge cardinality, whose proper colorings exactly coincide with the proper colorings of the unit distance graph on $\mathbb R^d$. We also provide partial generalizations of this result to arbitrary real normed vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Dihedral f-Tilings of the Sphere Induced by the M\"obius Triangle $(2,3,4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the special families of dihedral folding tilings of the sphere derived from the M\"obius triangle $(2,3,4)$. Our study emerges from the study of isometric foldings in the Riemann sphere and meets at the juncture of the triangle group $\Delta(2,3,4)$. The juxtaposition enables us to apply the classification theorem of edge-to-edge tilings of the sphere by congruent triangles and introduces a group theoretical method. The two prototiles of each family consist of the M\"obius triangle and another polygon induced by a reflection of the triangle group acting on the M\"obius triangle. To enumerate the tilings, we give two solutions to solve the associated constraint satisfaction problem. The methods are not exclusive to this problem and therefore applicable to similar problems of more general settings.</description>

      <title>The number of trees in distance-hereditary graphs and their friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting the number of spanning trees in specific classes of graphs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this note, we present unified proofs and generalizations of several results obtained in the 2020s. The main method is the study of vertex (degree) enumerators of distance-hereditary graphs, as conducted in~\cite{cherkashin2023stability}.</description>

      <title>The Exact Mixing Time for Trees of Fixed Order and Diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the extremal structure for the exact mixing time for random walks on trees $\mathcal{T}_{n,d}$ of order $n$ with diameter $d$. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $H(v,\pi)$ denote the expected length of an optimal stopping rule from vertex $v$ to the stationary distributon $\pi$. We show that the quantity $\max_{G \in \mathcal{T}_{n,d} } T_{\mbox{mix}}(G) = \max_{G \in \mathcal{T}_{n,d} } \max_{v \in V} H(v,\pi)$ is achieved uniquely by the balanced double broom.</description>

      <title>A formula for eigenvalues of integral Cayley graphs over abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Z$ be an abelian group, $ x \in Z$, and $[x] = \{ y : \langle x \rangle = \langle y \rangle \}$. A graph is called integral if all its eigenvalues are integers. It is known that a Cayley graph is integral if and only if its connection set can be express as union of the sets $[x] $. In this paper, we determine an algebraic formula for eigenvalues of the integral Cayley graph when the connection set is $ [x]$. This formula involves an analogue of M$\ddot{\text{o}}$bius function.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Union Closed Families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that when a graph exhibits a specific type of symmetry, it satisfies the Union Closed Conjecture(UCC). Additionally, we show that certain graph classes, such as Cylindrical Grid Graphs and Torus Grid Graphs also satisfy the conjecture. We prove the known result that the union closed family generated by cyclic translates of a fixed set satisfies the UCC, offering a simpler proof via symmetry arguments. Later, we show that the union closed family generated by the family obtained through cyclically shifting elements from selected translates also satisfies the conjecture.</description>

      <title>The structure of interval orders with no infinite antichain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every interval order $P$ with no infinite antichain has a Gallai decomposition. That is, $P$ is a lexicographical sum of proper interval orders over a chain, an antichain or a prime interval order. This is a consequence of the fact that the tree decomposition of a graph into robust modules, as introduced by Courcelle and Delhomm\'e (Theoretical Computer Science \textbf{394} (2008) 1--38), is chain finite whenever the graph has no infinite independent sets. Next, we prove that every prime interval order with no infinite antichain is at most countable and scattered. Furthermore, for each countable ordinal $\alpha$ we exhibit an example of a well-quasi-ordered prime interval order $P_\alpha$ whose chain of maximal antichains has Hausdorff rank $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius and spanning trees of graphs with leaf distance at least four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$. The leaf distance of a tree is defined as the minimum distance between any two leaves. Let $\mathcal{D}(G)$ and $\mathcal{Q}(G)$ be the distance matrix and signless Laplacian distance matrix of $G$, respectively. Motivated by the structure condition of Kaneko, Kano, and Suzuki (2007), we obtain the lower bound for the size of $G$ and the upper bound for the spectral radius of $\mathcal{D}(G)$ (resp. $\mathcal{Q}(G)$) to guarantee that $G$ contains a spanning tree with leaf distance at least four. Furthermore, we improve the adjacency spectral and signless Laplacian spectral results of Chen, Lv, Li, and Xu (in press) to determine whether $G$ contains a spanning tree with leaf distance at least four, and propose two questions for further research.</description>

      <title>Towards the Proximity Conjecture on Group-Labeled Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a matroid $M$ whose ground set is equipped with a labeling to an abelian group. A basis of $M$ is called $F$-avoiding if the sum of the labels of its elements is not in a forbidden label set $F$. H\"orsch, Imolay, Mizutani, Oki, and Schwarcz (2024) conjectured that if an $F$-avoiding basis exists, then any basis can be transformed into an $F$-avoiding basis by exchanging at most $|F|$ elements. This proximity conjecture is known to hold for certain specific groups; in the case where $|F| \le 2$; or when the matroid is subsequence-interchangeably base orderable (SIBO), which is a weakening of the so-called strongly base orderable (SBO) property.
  In this paper, we settle the proximity conjecture for sparse paving matroids or in the case where $|F| \le 4$. Related to the latter result, we present the first known example of a non-SIBO matroid. We further address the setting of multiple group-label constraints, showing proximity results for the cases of two labelings, SIBO matroids, matroids representable over a fixed, finite field, and sparse paving matroids.</description>

      <title>On the enumeration of permutation-invariant and complete Naples parking functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naples parking functions were introduced as a generalization of classical parking functions, in which cars are allowed to park backwards, by checking up to a fixed number of previous slots, before proceedings forward as usual. In our previous work (arXiv:2405.07522, 2024) we have provided a characterization of Naples parking functions in terms of the new notion of \emph{complete parking preference}. Our result also allowed us to describe a new characterization of permutation-invariant Naples parking functions, equivalent (but much simpler) to the one given by Carvalho et al.(arXiv:2109.01735, 2021) but using a completely different approach (and language).
  In the present article we address some natural enumerative issues concerning the above mentioned objects. We propose an effective approach to enumerate permutation-invariant Naples parking functions and complete Naples parking functions which is based on some natural combinatorial decompositions. We thus obtain formulas depending on some (generally simpler) quantities, which are of interest in their own right, and that can be described in a recursive fashion.</description>

      <title>Certain Domination Parameters and its Resolving Version of Fractal Cubic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks are designed to communicate, operate and allocate the tasks to the respective commodities. Operating the supercomputers became challenging, and it was handled by the network design commonly known as hypercube, denoted by $Q^n$. In a recent study, the hypercube networks were not enough to hold the parallel processors in the supercomputers. Thus, variants of hypercubes were discovered to produce an alternative to the hypercube. A new variant of the hypercube, the \textit{fractal cubic network}, can be used as the best alternative in the case of hypercubes, which was wrongly defined in [Eng. Sci. Technol. \textbf{18}(1) (2015) 32--41]. Arulperumjothi et al. recently corrected this definition and redefined the network in [Appl. Math. Comput. \textbf{452} (2023) 128037]. Our research investigates that the fractal cubic network is a \textit{rooted product} of two graphs. We try to determine its domination and resolving domination parameters, which could be applied to resource location and broadcasting-related problems.</description>

      <title>Linearly-exponential checking is enough for the Lonely Runner Conjecture and some of its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tao (2018) showed that in order to prove the Lonely Runner Conjecture (LRC) up to $n+1$ runners it suffices to consider positive integer velocities in the order of $n^{O(n^2)}$. Using the zonotopal reinterpretation of the conjecture due to the first and third authors (2017) we here drastically improve this result, showing that velocities up to $\binom{n+1}{2}^{n-1} \le n^{2n}$ are enough.
  We prove the same finite-checking result, with the same bound, for the more general \emph{shifted} Lonely Runner Conjecture (sLRC), except in this case our result depends on the solution of a question, that we dub the \emph{Lonely Vector Problem} (LVP), about sumsets of $n$ rational vectors in dimension two. We also prove the same finite-checking bound for a further generalization of sLRC that concerns cosimple zonotopes with $n$ generators, a class of lattice zonotopes that we introduce.
  In the last sections we look at dimensions two and three. In dimension two we prove our generalized version of sLRC (hence we reprove the sLRC for four runners), and in dimension three we show that to prove sLRC for five runners it suffices to look at velocities adding up to $195$ and with some additional constraints.</description>

We also define the corresponding concept of $n$-dimensional difference sets and extend some classic families of difference sets to higher dimensions. Complete classifications are performed for small parameters $(v,k,\lambda)$ and some interesting examples are presented.</description>

      <title>Spectral approaches for $d$-improper chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore algebraic approaches to $d$-improper and $t$-clustered colourings, where the colouring constraints are relaxed to allow some monochromatic edges. Bilu [J. Comb. Theory Ser. B, 96(4):608-613, 2006] proved a generalization of the Hoffman bound for $d$-improper colourings. We strengthen this theorem by characterizing the equality case. In particular, if the Hoffman bound is tight for a graph $G$, then the $d$-improper Hoffman bound is tight for the strong product $G \boxtimes K_{d+1}$. Moreover, we prove d-improper analogous for the inertia bound by Cvetkov\'ic and the multi-eigenvalue lower bounds of Elphick and Wocjan.
  We conjecture an equality between the chromatic number of a graph $G$ and the $d$-improper chromatic number of its strong product with a complete graph, $G \boxtimes K_{d+1}$, and prove the conjecture in special graph classes, including perfect graphs and graphs with chromatic number at most 4. Other supporting evidence for the conjecture includes a fractional analogue, a clustered analogue, and various spectral relaxations of the equality.</description>

      <title>Optical orthogonal codes from a combinatorial perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are sets of $(0,1)$-sequences with good auto- and cross- correlation properties. They were originally introduced for use in multi-access communication, particularly in the setting of optical CDMA communications systems. They can also be formulated in terms of families of subsets of $\Z_v$, where the correlation properties can be expressed in terms of conditions on the internal and external differences within and between the subsets. With this link there have been many studies on their combinatorial properties. However, in most of these studies it is assumed that the auto- and cross-correlation values are equal; in particular, many constructions focus on the case where both correlation values are $1$. This is not a requirement of the original communications application. In this paper, we "decouple" the two correlation values and consider the situation with correlation values greater than $1$. We consider the bounds on each of the correlation values, and the structural implications of meeting these separately, as well as associated links with other combinatorial objects. We survey definitions, properties and constructions, establish some new connections and concepts, and discuss open questions.</description>

      <title>Path decompositions of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing the edges of a digraph into as few paths as possible. A natural lower bound for the number of paths in any path decomposition of a digraph $D$ is $\frac{1}{2}\sum_{v\in V(D)}|d^+(v)-d^-(v)|$; any digraph that achieves this bound is called consistent. Alspach, Mason, and Pullman conjectured in 1976 that every tournament of even order is consistent and this was recently verified for large tournaments by Gir\~ao, Granet, K\"uhn, Lo, and Osthus. A more general conjecture of Pullman states that for odd $d$, every orientation of a $d$-regular graph is consistent. We prove that the conjecture holds for random $d$-regular graphs with high probability i.e. for fixed odd $d$ and as $n \to \infty$ the conjecture holds for almost all $d$-regular graphs. Along the way, we verify Pullman's conjecture for graphs whose girth is sufficiently large (as a function of the degree).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple finite connected graph of order $n$ greater than or equal to $3$. We obtain the following results:
  (1). We apply a result of Hamada and Yoshimura from 1976 and some recent results of Alikhani and Soltani (2020) and Kalinowski and Pilsniak (2015) to determine the distinguishing chromatic number of the middle graph $M(G)$ of the graph $G$. In particular, the distinguishing chromatic number $\chi_{D}(M(G))$ of the middle graph $M(G)$ of the graph $G$ is $\Delta(G)+1$ except for four small graphs $C_{4}, K_{4}, C_{6}$, and $K_{3,3}$, and $\Delta(G)+2$ otherwise.
  (2). In 2016, Kalinowski, Pilsniak, and Wozniak introduced the total distinguishing number $D''(G)$ of $G$. Inspired by a recent result of Mirafzal (2024), we show that the distinguishing number $D(S(G))$ of the subdivision graph $S(G)$ of $G$ is $D''(G)$. Consequently, $D(S(G))$ is at most $\lceil \sqrt{\Delta(G)}\rceil$.
  (3). We obtain a sharp upper bound for the distinguishing chromatic number of the subdivision graph $S(G)$ of $G$ in terms of the distinguishing number of $G$.</description>

      <title>Cluster-cyclic condition of skew-symmetrizable matrices of rank 3 via the Markov constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider mutations of skew-symmetrizable matrices of rank 3. Every skew-symmetrizable matrix corresponds to a weighted quiver, and we study the conditions when this quiver is always cyclic after applying mutations. In this study, the Markov constant has an essential meaning. It has already appeared in some previous works for skew-symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Positive codegree Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s theorem for the generalized triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07090v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s Theorem from 1974 shows that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph with minimum degree greater than $2n/5$ must be bipartite.
  We establish a positive codegree extension of this result for the $r$-uniform generalized triangle $\mathrm{T}_{r} = \left\{\{1,\ldots, r-1,r\}, \{1,\ldots, r-1,r+1\},\{r,r+1, \ldots, 2r-1\}\right\}$$\colon$ For every $n \ge (r-1)(2r+1)/2$, if $\mathcal{H}$ is an $n$-vertex $\mathrm{T}_{r}$-free $r$-uniform hypergraph in which each $(r-1)$-tuple of vertices is contained in either zero edges or more than $2n/(2r+1)$ edges of $\mathcal{H}$, then $\mathcal{H}$ is $r$-partite. This result provides the first tight positive codegree Andr{\'a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type theorem for hypergraphs. It also immediately implies that the positive codegree Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathrm{T}_{r}$ is $\lfloor n/r \rfloor$ for all $r$. Additionally, for $r=3$, our result answers one of the questions posed by Hou et al.~\cite{HLYZZ22} in a strong form.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds for intersection-reverse sequences, edge-ordered graphs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2006, Marcus and Tardos proved that if $A^1,\dots,A^n$ are cyclic orders on some subsets of a set of $n$ symbols such that the common elements of any two distinct orders $A^i$ and $A^j$ appear in reversed cyclic order in $A^i$ and $A^j$, then $\sum_{i} |A^i|=O(n^{3/2}\log n)$. This result is tight up to the logarithmic factor and has since become an important tool in Discrete Geometry. We improve this to the optimal bound $O(n^{3/2})$. In fact, we show that if $A^1,\dots,A^n$ are linear orders on some subsets of a set of $n$ symbols such that no three symbols appear in the same order in any two distinct linear orders, then $\sum_{i} |A^i|=O(n^{3/2})$. Using this result, we resolve several open problems in Discrete Geometry and Extremal Graph Theory as follows.
  We prove that every $n$-vertex topological graph that does not contain a self-crossing four-cycle has $O(n^{3/2})$ edges. This resolves a problem of Marcus and Tardos from 2006. We also show that $n$ pseudo-circles in the plane can be cut into $O(n^{3/2})$ pseudo-segments, which, in turn, implies new bounds on point-circle incidences and on other geometric problems. Moreover, we prove that the edge-ordered Tur\'an number of the four-cycle $C_4^{1243}$ is $\Theta(n^{3/2})$. This answers a question of Gerbner, Methuku, Nagy, P\'alv\"olgyi, Tardos and Vizer.
  Using different methods, we determine the largest possible extremal number that an edge-ordered forest of order chromatic number two can have. Kucheriya and Tardos showed that every such graph has extremal number at most $n2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$, and conjectured that this can be improved to $n(\log n)^{O(1)}$. We disprove their conjecture by showing that for every $C&gt;0$, there exists an edge-ordered tree of order chromatic number two whose extremal number is $\Omega(n 2^{C\sqrt{\log n}})$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hypergraph matrix, named the unified matrix, and use it to represent the hypergraph as a graph. We show that the unified matrix of a hypergraph is identical to the adjacency matrix of the associated graph. This enables us to use the spectrum of the unified matrix of a hypergraph as a tool to connect the structural properties of the hypergraph with those of the associated graph. Additionally, we introduce certain hypergraph structures and invariants during this process, and relate them to the eigenvalues of the unified matrix.</description>

      <title>A necessary and sufficient condition for $k$-transversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to admit a $k$-transversal, for any $0 \le k \le d-1$. This result is a common generalization of Helly's theorem ($k=0$) and the Goodman-Pollack-Wenger theorem ($k=d-1$). Additionally, we obtain an analogue in the complex setting by characterizing the existence of a complex $k$-transversal to a family of convex sets in $\mathbb{C}^d$, extending the work of McGinnis ($k=d-1$). Our approach employs a Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem on Stiefel manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study vanishing of Fourier coefficients of holomorphic $\eta$-quotients. We investigate examples of two different types: the first one involves integral weight CM newforms, while the second one involves half-integral weight $\eta$-quotients associated with sums of squares and Hurwitz class numbers.</description>

      <title>The Rogers-Ramanujan dissection of a theta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Page 27 of Ramanujan's Lost Notebook contains a beautiful identity which not only gives, as a special case, a famous modular relation between the Rogers-Ramanujan functions $G(q)$ and $H(q)$ but also a relation between two fifth order mock theta functions and $G(q)$ and $H(q)$. We generalize Ramanujan's relation with the help of a parameter $s$ to get an infinite family of such identities. Our result shows that a theta function can always be ``dissected'' as a finite sum of products of generalized Rogers-Ramanujan functions. Several well-known results are shown to be consequences of our theorem, for example, a generalization of the Jacobi triple product identity and Andrews' relation between two of his generalized third order mock theta functions. We give enough evidence, through asymptotic analysis as well as by other means, to show that the identities we get from our main result for $s&gt;2$ transcend the modular world and hence look difficult to be written in the form of a modular relation. Using asymptotic analysis, we also offer a clinching evidence that explains how Ramanujan may have arrived at his generalized modular relation.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study inside-out dissections of polygons and polyhedra. We first show that an arbitrary polygon can be inside-out dissected with $2n+1$ pieces, thereby improving the best previous upper bound of $4(n-2)$ pieces. Additionally, we establish that a regular polygon can be inside-out dissected with at most $6$ pieces. Lastly, we prove that any polyhedron that can be decomposed into finitely many regular tetrahedra and octahedra can be inside-out dissected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study different compactifications of the moduli space of $n$ distinct weighted labeled points in a flag of affine spaces. We construct these spaces via the weighted and generalized Fulton-MacPherson compactifications of Routis and Kim-Sato. For certain weights, our compactifications are toric and isomorphic to the polypermutohedral and polystellahedral varieties, which arise in the work of Crowley-Huh-Larson-Simpson-Wang and Eur-Larson on polymatroids, a generalization of matroids. Moreover, we show that these toric compactifications have a fibration structure, with fibers isomorphic to the Losev-Manin space, and are related to each other via a geometric quotient.</description>

      <title>The Exponential Lie Series and a Chen-Strichartz Formula for Levy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a Chen-Strichartz formula for stochastic differential equations driven by Levy processes, that is, we derive a series expansion of the logarithm of the flowmap of the stochastic differential equation in terms of commutators of vector fields with stochastic coefficients, and we provide an explicit formula for the components in this series. The stochastic components are generated by the Levy processes that drive the stochastic differential equation and their quadratic variation and power jumps; the vector fields are given as linear combinations of commutators of elements in the pre-Lie Magnus expansion generated by the original vector fields governing our stochastic differential equation. In particular, we show the logarithm of the flowmap is a Lie series. These results extend previous results for deterministic differential equations and continuous stochastic differential equations. For these, the Chen-Strichartz series has shown to play a pivotal role in the design of numerical integration schemes that preserve qualitative properties of the solution such as the construction of geometric numerical schemes and in the context of efficient numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence Problem of E-Pattern Languages with Length Constraints is Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterns are words with terminals and variables. The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. Length constraints restrict valid substitutions of variables by associating the variables of a pattern with a system (or disjunction of systems) of linear diophantine inequalities. Pattern languages with length constraints contain only words in which all variables are substituted to words with lengths that fulfill such a given set of length constraints. We consider membership, inclusion, and equivalence problems for erasing and non-erasing pattern languages with length constraints. Our main result shows that the erasing equivalence problem, one of the most prominent open problems in the realm of patterns-becomes undecidable if length constraints are allowed in addition to variable equality. Additionally, it is shown that the terminal-free inclusion problem-another prominent open problem in the realm of patterns-is also undecidable in this setting. It is also shown that considering regular constraints, i.e., associating variables also with regular languages as additional restrictions together with length constraints for valid substitutions, results in undecidability of the non-erasing equivalence problem. This sets a first upper bound on constraints to obtain undecidability in this case, as this problem is trivially decidable in the case of no constraints and as it has unknown decidability if only regular- or only length-constraints are considered.</description>

      <title>Hyperplanes Avoiding Problem and Integer Points Counting in Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our work, we consider the problem of computing a vector $x \in Z^n$ of minimum $\|\cdot\|_p$-norm such that $a^\top x \not= a_0$, for any vector $(a,a_0)$ from a given subset of $Z^n$ of size $m$. In other words, we search for a vector of minimum norm that avoids a given finite set of hyperplanes, which is natural to call as the $\textit{Hyperplanes Avoiding Problem}$. This problem naturally appears as a subproblem in Barvinok-type algorithms for counting integer points in polyhedra. More precisely, it appears when one needs to evaluate certain rational generating functions in an avoidable critical point. We show that:
  1) With respect to $\|\cdot\|_1$, the problem admits a feasible solution $x$ with $\|x\|_1 \leq (m+n)/2$, and show that such solution can be constructed by a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm with $O(n \cdot m)$ operations. Moreover, this inequality is the best possible. This is a significant improvement over the previous randomized algorithm, which computes $x$ with a guaranty $\|x\|_{1} \leq n \cdot m$. The original approach of A.~Barvinok can guarantee only $\|x\|_1 = O\bigl((n \cdot m)^n\bigr)$;
  2) The problem is NP-hard with respect to any norm $\|\cdot\|_p$, for $p \in \bigl(R_{\geq 1} \cup \{\infty\}\bigr)$.
  3) As an application, we show that the problem to count integer points in a polytope $P = \{x \in R^n \colon A x \leq b\}$, for given $A \in Z^{m \times n}$ and $b \in Q^m$, can be solved by an algorithm with $O\bigl(\nu^2 \cdot n^3 \cdot \Delta^3 \bigr)$ operations, where $\nu$ is the maximum size of a normal fan triangulation of $P$, and $\Delta$ is the maximum value of rank-order subdeterminants of $A$. It refines the previous state-of-the-art $O\bigl(\nu^2 \cdot n^4 \cdot \Delta^3\bigr)$-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Markov chains on trees: almost lower and upper directed cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition matrix of a Markov chain $(X_k,k\geq 0)$ on a finite or infinite rooted tree is said to be almost upper-directed if, given $X_k$, the node $X_{k+1}$ is either a descendant of $X_k$ or the parent of $X_k$. It is said to be almost lower-directed if given $X_k$, $X_{k+1}$ is either an ancestor of $X_k$ or a child of $X_k$.
  These models include nearest neighbor Markov chains on trees.
  Under an irreducibility assumption, we show that every almost upper-directed transition matrix on infinite (locally finite) trees has some invariant measures. An invariant measure $\pi$ is expressed thanks to a determinantal formula. We give general explicit criteria for recurrence and positive recurrence. An efficient algorithm (the leaf addition algorithm) of independent interest allows $\pi$ to be computed on many trees, without resorting to linear algebra considerations.
  Flajolet, in a series of papers, provided some relations between continuous fractions, generating functions of weighted M\"otzkin paths, and used them in connection with the analysis of birth and death processes. These fruitful representations made it possible to establish many formulae for continuous fractions. Analogous considerations appear here: this type of study can be extended to weighted paths on trees, whose generating functions can also be expressed, this time in terms of multicontinuous fractions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish simple $k$-fold summation expressions for the Quot and motivic Cohen--Lenstra zeta functions associated with the $(2,2k)$ torus links. Such expressions lead us to some multiple Rogers--Ramanujan type identities and their finitizations, thereby confirming a conjecture of Huang and Jiang. Several other properties of the two zeta functions will be examined as well.</description>

Abstract: We study the counts of smooth permutations and smooth polynomials over finite fields. For both counts we prove an estimate with an error term that matches the error term found in the integer setting by de Bruijn more than 70 years ago. The main term is the usual Dickman $\rho$ function, but with its argument shifted.
  We determine the order of magnitude of $\log(p_{n,m}/\rho(n/m))$ where $p_{n,m}$ is the probability that a permutation on $n$ elements, chosen uniformly at random, is $m$-smooth.
  We uncover a phase transition in the polynomial setting: the probability that a polynomial of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{F}_q$ is $m$-smooth changes its behavior at $m\approx (3/2)\log_q n$.</description>

      <title>Invariants of Tutte Partitions and a $q$-Analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a construction of the Tutte polynomial for both matroids and $q$-matroids based on an appropriate partition of the underlying support lattice into intervals that correspond to prime-free minors, which we call a Tutte partition. We show that such partitions in the matroid case include the class of partitions arising in Crapo's definition of the Tutte polynomial, while not representing a direct $q$-analogue of such partitions. We propose axioms of $q$-Tutte-Grothendiek invariance and show that this yields a $q$-analogue of Tutte-Grothendiek invariance. We establish the connection between the rank polynomial and the Tutte polynomial, showing that one can be obtained from the other by convolution.</description>

Abstract: We generate anti-self-polar polytopes via a numerical implementation of the gradient flow induced by the diameter functional on the space of all finite subsets of the sphere, and prove related results on the critical points of the diameter functional as well as results about the combinatorics of such polytopes. We also discuss potential connections to Borsuk's conjecture.</description>

      <title>List-Coloring Packing and Correspondence-Coloring Packing of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ and a list assignment $L$ with $|L(v)|=k$ for all $v$, an $L$-packing consists of $L$-colorings $\varphi_1,\cdots,\varphi_k$ such that $\varphi_i(v)\ne\varphi_j(v)$ for all $v$ and all distinct $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$. Let $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)$ denote the smallest $k$ such that $G$ has an $L$-packing for every $L$ with $|L(v)|=k$ for all $v$. Let $\mathcal{P}_k$ denote the set of all planar graphs with girth at least $k$. We show that (i) $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)\le 8$ for all $G\in \mathcal{P}_3$ and (ii) $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)\le 5$ for all $G\in \mathcal{P}_4$ and (iii) $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)\le 4$ for all $G\in \mathcal{P}_5$. Part (i) makes progress on a problem of Cambie, Cames van Batenburg, Davies, and Kang. We also construct outerplanar graphs $G$ such that $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)=4$, which matches the known upper bound $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}(G)\le 4$ for all outerplanar graphs. Finally, we consider the analogue of $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}$ for correspondence coloring, $\chi^{\star}_c$. In fact, all bounds stated above for $\chi^{\star}_{\ell}$ also hold for $\chi^{\star}_c$.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 3: strong regularity and the vertex partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is part 3 in a series of papers about the growth of regular partitions in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. We consider here the strong regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. This type of regular decomposition comes with two components, a partition of vertices, and a partition of pairs of vertices. We define two corresponding growth functions associated to a hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs: $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ which measures the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$ which measures the size of the pairs component. In this paper, we give an almost complete description of the possible growth rates for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$: constant, polynomial, between single and double exponential, or wowzer. The only existing lower bound constructions for this type of hypergraph regularity were due to Moshkovitz and Shapira, who constructed examples requiring a wowzer-type lower bound on the vertex component in a weaker type of hypergraph regularity. The results of this paper rely crucially on the fact that a slightly simpler construction can be used to produce a wowzer type lower bound for $T_{\mathcal{H}}$. The key ingredient in this simpler example is a lower bound construction for strong graph regularity due to Conlon and Fox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the fourth in a series of papers on the growth of regular partitions in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we consider a form of regularity for $3$-uniform hypergraphs which was developed by Frankl, Gowers, Kohayakawa, Nagle, R\"{o}dl, Skokan, and Schacht. Regular decompositions of this type involve two components, a partition on the vertex set and a partition on the pairs of vertices. To each hereditary property $\mathcal{H}$ of $3$-uniform hypergraphs, we associate two corresponding growth functions: $T_{\mathcal{H}}$ for the size of the vertex component, and $L_{\mathcal{H}}$ for the size of the pairs component. In this paper we consider the behavior of the function $L_{\mathcal{H}}$. We show any such function is either constant, bounded above and below by a polynomial, or bounded below by an exponential.</description>

      <title>A Study On The Graph Formulation Of Union Closed Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Union Closed Conjecture is one of the most renowned problems in Combinatorics. Its appeal lies in the simplicity of its statement contrasted with the potential complexity of its resolution. The conjecture posits that, in any union-closed family of sets, there exists at least one element that appears in at least half of the sets within the family.
  We establish the graph-theoretic version of certain set-theoretic results by connecting the set-based and graph-based formulations. We then prove a theorem in which we investigate the conjecture for graphs, focusing on their decompositions and the position of certain pendant vertices. As a result, we extend the validity of the conjecture to a broader class of graph structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, Andrews mentioned that George Beck introduced partition statistics $M_w(r,m,n)$, which denote the total number of ones in the partition of $n$ with crank congruent to $r$ modulo $m$. Recently, a number of congruences and identities involving $M_w(r,m,n)$ for some small $m$ have been developed. We establish the 11-dissection of the generating functions for $M_{\omega}(r,11,n)-M_{\omega}(11-r,11,n)$, where $r=1,2,3,4,5$. In particular, we discover a beautiful identity involving $M_{\omega}(r,11,11n+6)$.</description>

      <title>Partite saturation number of cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is said to be $F$-saturated relative to $G$, if $H$ does not contain any copy of $F$, but the addition of any edge $e$ in $E(G)\backslash E(H)$ would create a copy of $F$. The minimum size of an $F$-saturated graph relative to $G$ is denoted by $sat(G,F)$. Let $K_k^n$ be the complete $k$-partite graph containing $n$ vertices in each part and $C_\ell$ be the cycle of length $\ell$. In this paper we give an asymptotically tight bound of $sat(K_k^n,C_\ell)$ for all $ \ell \geq 4, k \geq 2$ except $(\ell,k)=(4,4)$. Moreover, we determined the exact value of $sat(K_k^n,C_\ell)$ for $ k&gt;\ell=4 $ and $5 \geq \ell&gt;k \geq 3$ and $(\ell,k)=(6,2)$.</description>

      <title>Corrigendum to the equivalent statement of the Laplacian Spread Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G,$ let $\alpha(G)$ denote its second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue. The Laplacian Spread Conjecture states that $\alpha(G)+\alpha(\overline{G}) \geq 1,$ where $\overline{G}$ is the complement of $G.$ In this paper, we have corrected two conclusions: First, the necessary and sufficient condition for $\alpha(G) + \alpha(\overline{G}) \geq 1$ is $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 1$ rather than $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 2$ which has been proved in \cite{BS} as demonstrated in our study. Second, we show that the Laplacian spread of balanced digraph $\Gamma$ satisfies $LS(\Gamma) \leq n - \frac{1}{2}$ but not $LS(\Gamma) \leq n - 1$ in \cite{BCEHK}, since inequality $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 2$ does not hold.</description>

      <title>The cut norm and Sampling Lemmas for unbounded kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the bounded kernel results of Borgs, Chayes, Lov\'asz, S\'os and Vesztergombi (2008), we prove two Sampling Lemmas for unbounded kernels with respect to the cut norm. On the one hand, we show that given a (symmetric) kernel $U\in L^p([0,1]^2)$ for some $3&lt;p&lt;\infty$, the cut norm of a random $k$-sample of $U$ is with high probability within $O(k^{-\frac14+\frac{1}{4p}})$ of the cut norm of $U$. The cut norm of the sample has a strong bias to being larger than the original, allowing us to actually obtain a stronger high probability bound of order $O(k^{-\frac 12+\frac1p+\varepsilon})$ for how much smaller it can be (for any $p&gt;2$ here). These results are then partially extended to the case of vector valued kernels. On the other hand, we show that with high probability, the $k$-samples are also close to $U$ in the cut metric, albeit with a weaker bound of order $O((\ln k)^{-\frac12+\frac1{2p}})$ (for any appropriate $p&gt;2$). As a corollary, we obtain that whenever $U\in L^p$ with $p&gt;4$, the $k$-samples converge almost surely to $U$ in the cut metric as $k\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By interpreting Kostka numbers as tensor product multiplicities in the BGG category O for the special linear Lie algebras, we provide a new proof of the classical Jacobi--Trudi identities for skew Schur polynomials, derived from the celebrated Weyl character formula. We re-establish the Schur positivity of certain truncations in the Jacobi--Trudi expansion of skew Schur polynomials and obtain Schur positivity results for similar truncations in the Jacobi--Trudi-type expansion of the product of two Schur polynomials. Furthermore, we interpret the coefficients in the Schur polynomial expansions of these Jacobi--Trudi truncations as tensor product multiplicities in the BGG category O.</description>

Abstract: A vector partition function is the number of ways to write a vector as a non-negative integer-coefficient sum of the elements of a finite set of vectors $\Delta$. We present a new algorithm for computing closed-form formulas for vector partition functions as quasi-polynomials over a finite set of pointed polyhedral cones, implemented in the ``calculator'' computer algebra system. We include an exposition of previously known theory of vector partition functions. While our results are not new, our exposition is elementary and self-contained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to reprove an old result of R\'edei's on the number of directions determined by a set of cardinality $p$ in $\mathbb{F}_p^2$, Somlai proved that the non-constant polynomials over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ whose range sums are equal to $p$ are of degree at least $\frac{p-1}{2}$. Here the summand in the range sum are considered as integers from the interval $[0,p-1]$. In this paper we characterise all of these polynomials having degree exactly $\frac{p-1}{2}$, if $p$ is large enough. As a consequence, for the same set of primes we re-establish the characterisation of sets with few determined directions due to Lov\'asz and Schrijver using discrete Fourier analysis.</description>

Abstract: We provide the following result and its discrete equivalent: Let $f \colon I^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ be a continuous function. Then, there exist a point $p \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and a compact subset $S \subset f^{-1}\left[\left\{p\right\}\right]$ which connects some opposite faces of the $n$-dimensional unit cube $I^n$. We give an example that shows it cannot be generalized to path-connected sets. Additionally, we show that the $n$-dimensional Steinhaus Chessboard Theorem and the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem are simple consequences of this result.</description>

Our proof is direct and short, and the inductive step rests on a combinatorial statement that works over matroids.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new spanning tree model called the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE), which interpolates between the uniform spanning tree and the minimum spanning tree as the inverse temperature (disorder strength) $\beta$ varies. On the complete graph with $n$ vertices and i.i.d.\ uniform disorder variables on the edges, we identify: (1) a low disorder regime with $\beta \leq C n/\log n$, where the diameter of the random spanning tree is typically of order $n^{1/2}$, the same as for the uniform spanning tree; (2) a high disorder regime with $\beta \geq n^{4/3} \log n$, where the diameter is typically of order $n^{1/3}$, the same as for the minimum spanning tree. We conjecture that for $\beta=n^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (1, 4/3)$, the diameter is of order $n^{\gamma+o(1)}$ for some $\gamma=\gamma(\alpha)$ strictly between $1/2$ and $1/3$.</description>
