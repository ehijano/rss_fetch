      <title>Insurance Supervision under Climate Change: A Pioneer Detection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Pioneer Detection Method, a supervisory tool we developed to enhance resilience in insurance markets facing the challenges posed by climate change. Based on a theoretical model of the insurance industry, we consider a scenario in which independent experts determine premiums according to their individual risk assessments. Due to the segmented nature of the private insurance market, accurately estimating the tail parameter of loss distribution is difficult, especially given the rarity of extreme events. Our method leverages temporal directional change and convergence to integrate expert opinions, giving greater emphasis to those who effectively identify trend shifts after climate stress. A series of simulations reveals that the Pioneer Detection Method outperforms traditional pooling methods within a Bayesian framework. Furthermore, this approach appears to be notably effective in improving welfare in an insurance market with a limited number of private entities.</description>

      <title>Reactive Marketing and the Co-Production of (In)Authenticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Businesses often react to external events by sending pro-social messages on social media that show the sender's alignment with the underlying prosocial cause and enhance their brand image. Consumers are uncertain about the authenticity of such messages because a company can choose to send prosocial messages even when their alignment with the social cause is not genuine. We study the sender's incentives to send (in)authentic messages and the consumer's reactions when an external investigator can verify the sender's message.
  We find that the sender's equilibrium strategy depends on the receiver's emphasis on external investigation versus their self-signaling incentives. When the receiver is more internally focused, the sender chooses self-sufficiency strategy, building credibility independent of external investigation. When the receiver is more externally focused, the sender can either use self-sufficiency or complementarity, the latter relying on validation by the external investigator. Thus, authenticity is coproduced by the sender, the receiver, and the investigator. Importantly, self-sufficiency results in more authenticity in reactive marketing messages than complementarity.
  We extend the model to incorporate confirmation bias of the receiver. We show that confirmation bias can act a doubled-edged sword, sometimes making the sender's persuasion task easier and other times making it more difficult.</description>

      <title>Real Option AI: Reversibility, Silence, and the Release Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the cadence of AI product releases, i.e. quiet spells, reversible patches, and rarer pivots, as optimal exercise of strategic real options under reputational learning. A privately observed technical state follows a diffusion. The firm controls two upgrade options with asymmetric costs and reversibility (a cheap patch and a costly pivot) and a publication-frequency clock, a Cox process whose intensity governs when noisy public performance and safety signals are disclosed. For sufficiently low clock costs the optimal policy posts observable clock-off windows around knife-edge regions. These windows shut down the martingale part of public beliefs, eliminate knife-edge mixing, and collapse behavior to a two-rung release ladder with endogenous triggers, jump targets, and no interior mixing. Within stationary Markov strategies we show that this ladder is uniquely characterized by a boundary-value system with value matching and smooth pasting at triggers and target optimality at jump targets. We endogenize market or platform adoption as a threshold rule in public beliefs and show that leverage creates an irreversibility wedge: the gap between first-best and levered surplus is bounded by the takeover switching cost of the least reversible rung. Patches are debt-insensitive; pivots can be distorted, but only up to that bound. The framework predicts telemetry signatures in firm-authored disclosures: a pre-release cadence dip in publication intensity and intra-month dispersion as the clock is shut off before a major reset; two post-release plateaus in disclosed performance, consistent with patch versus pivot jump targets; and debt-insensitive patch timing in high-reversibility regimes, with leverage effects concentrated in pivots. Unlike option-implied volatility spikes, these patterns reflect the firm's own throttling of technical signals rather than market pricing of event risk.</description>

      <title>Basically Trapped -- A General Equilibrium Approach to the Undersupply of Basic Research in Free Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I propose a micro-based innovation driven general equilibrium growth-model allowing for endogenous entry and exit as well as three different types of research. I make the novel distinction between three types of firms, namely basic and applied research where applied research is again differentiated into high and low type research to account for a heterogeneous firm environment. I further propose a new and flexible way to model basic research spillovers in this model class. While previous literature addresses the effect of R&amp;D policies in general, my findings suggest, there is no optimal market solution in which basic research takes a noteworthy share. In order to counteract this undersupply and to take advantage of basic research spillovers, a sizable basic research subsidy is required to sufficiently crowd-in basic research which then allows for a substantial increase in welfare. My findings also suggest the necessity for purely state-financed basic research to approach the social planner solution in a feasible manner.</description>

      <title>Delegation and Lobbying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter examines the link between delegation and lobbying, two themes central to political economy. Delegation models explore how legislatures manage uncertainty and control bureaucratic agents, while lobbying models analyze how organized interests influence policy through contributions, information, and advocacy. We review the growing body of research that integrates these literatures, showing how the prospect of lobbying affects legislative incentives to delegate and how the structure of delegated authority shapes lobbying strategies. We highlight common-agency frameworks that capture the recursive relationship between delegation and lobbying and empirical studies documenting how venue choice, information provision, and interest group mobilization mediate delegation outcomes. We also review applications to agency oversight and fiscal policy. Finally, we present a model of regulatory rule-making that embeds lobbying directly into the delegation decision, offering predictions for both theory and empirical analysis.</description>
