      <title>Fused $L_{1/2}$ prior for large scale linear inverse problem with Gibbs bouncy particle sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Bayesian approach for solving large scale linear inverse problems arising in various scientific and engineering fields. We propose a fused $L_{1/2}$ prior with edge-preserving and sparsity-promoting properties and show that it can be formulated as a Gaussian mixture Markov random field. Since the density function of this family of prior is neither log-concave nor Lipschitz, gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can not be applied to sample the posterior. Thus, we present a Gibbs sampler in which all the conditional posteriors involved have closed form expressions. The Gibbs sampler works well for small size problems but it is computationally intractable for large scale problems due to the need for sample high dimensional Gaussian distribution. To reduce the computation burden, we construct a Gibbs bouncy particle sampler (Gibbs-BPS) based on a piecewise deterministic Markov process. This new sampler combines elements of Gibbs sampler with bouncy particle sampler and its computation complexity is an order of magnitude smaller. We show that the new sampler converges to the target distribution. With computed tomography examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method shows competitive performance with existing popular Bayesian methods and is highly efficient in large scale problems.</description>

      <title>Localized Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the generative problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. In this paper, we build on previous work combining Schr\"odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. A key bottleneck of this approach is the exponential dependence of the required training samples on the dimension, $d$, of the ambient state space. We propose a localization strategy which exploits conditional independence of conditional expectation values. Localization thus replaces a single high-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problem by $d$ low-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problems over the available training samples. As for the original approach, the localized sampler is stable and geometric ergodic. The sampler also naturally extends to conditional sampling and to Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on a Gaussian problem with increasing dimensions and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Two-Sample Testing under Right-Censored Data: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) methods for two-sample testing with right-censored observations. To achieve this, we develop several ML-based methods with varying architectures and implement them as two-sample tests. Each method is an ensemble (stacking) that combines predictions from classical two-sample tests. This paper presents the results of training the proposed ML methods, examines their statistical power compared to classical two-sample tests, analyzes the distribution of test statistics for the proposed methods when the null hypothesis is true, and evaluates the significance of the features incorporated into the proposed methods. All results from numerical experiments were obtained from a synthetic dataset generated using the Smirnov transform (Inverse Transform Sampling) and replicated multiple times through Monte Carlo simulation. To test the two-sample problem with right-censored observations, one can use the proposed two-sample methods. All necessary materials (source code, example scripts, dataset, and samples) are available on GitHub and Hugging Face.</description>
