      <title>Dispersion and losses of plasmons along simple metasurfaces: the analysis of dispersion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flat metasurfaces described by tensor surface conductivity, the transverse size of which is small compared to the wavelength, are considered. In this case, we introduce two-dimensional surface conductivity for them, as well as for infinitely thin conductive sheets of graphene type. The method of Green's tensor functions of electrodynamics connecting fields and current densities, as well as the mode matching technique, are used. Conductive films on substrates are considered, including layered substrates of finite thickness with periodic layers and infinite substrates, as well as gradient substrates with a dependence of the dielectric constant on the thickness. Two-dimensional periodic structures of conductive films and dielectric films doped with nanoparticles are also analyzed. The possibility of applying the method to diffraction of surface plasmons on metasurface inhomogeneities is analyzed.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear graphene response on monochromatic electromagnetic wave in the form as generation of harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the linear and nonlinear response of a weighted graphene sheet under the normal incidence of a plane electromagnetic wave in the form of a quasi-monochromatic pulse of long duration with a sharp edge and harmonic filling. The generation of odd harmonics in the reflected and transmitted spectra is obtained. The coefficient of transformation of the first harmonic into the third harmonic at a frequency of 10 Hz is of the order of 10-3. We use perturbative theory based on the quantum Wallace strong coupling model with field amplitude expansion and integration over the entire Brillouin zone (BZ), solving the kinetic Boltzmann equation with a collision integral in the Bhatnagar-Gross-Crook (BGK) form. The electromagnetic field is considered classically, while its vector potential changes the quasi-pulse in the dispersion equation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of collective photon emission and ferroelectric ordering of excitons near their Mott insulating state in a WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking, arising from the competition of interactions and quantum fluctuations, is fundamental to understanding ordered electronic phases. Although electrically neutral, optical excitations like excitons can interact through their dipole moment, raising the possibility of optically active ordered phases. The effects of spontaneous ordering on optical properties remain largely unexplored. Recent observations of the excitonic Mott insulating state in semiconducting moir\'e crystals make them promising for addressing this question. Here, we present evidence for an in-plane ferroelectric phase of dipolar moir\'e excitons driven by strong exciton-exciton interactions. We discover a surprising speed-up of photon emission at late times and low densities in excitonic decay. This counterintuitive behavior is attributed to collective radiance, linked to the transition between disordered and symmetry-broken ferroelectric phases of moir\'e excitons. Our findings provide first evidence for strong dipolar inter-site interactions in moir\'e lattices, demonstrate collective photon emission as a probe for moir\'e quantum materials, and pave the way for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Comment on "InAs-Al hybrid devices passing the topological gap protocol", Microsoft Quantum, Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological gap protocol (TGP) is presented as "a series of stringent experimental tests" for the presence of topological superconductivity and associated Majorana bound states. Here, we show that the TGP, 'passed' by Microsoft Quantum [PRB 107, 245423 (2023)], lacks a consistent definition of 'gap' or 'topological', and even utilises different parameters when applied to theoretical simulations compared to experimental data. Furthermore, the TGP's outcome is sensitive to the choice of magnetic field range, bias voltage range, data resolution, and number of cutter voltage pairs - data parameters that, in PRB 107, 245423 (2023), vary significantly, even for measurements of the same device. As a result, the core claims of PRB 107, 245423 (2023) are primarily based on unexplained measurement choices and inconsistent definitions, rather than on intrinsic properties of the studied devices. As such, Microsoft Quantum's claim in PRB 107, 245423 (2023) that their devices have a "high probability of being in the topological phase" is not reliable and must be revisited. Our findings also suggest that subsequent studies, e.g. Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), that are based on tuning up devices via the TGP are built on a flawed protocol and should also be revisited.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Spin-to-Charge Conversion in Topological Insulator-Magnetic Insulator Heterostructures at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, topological insulators have received enormous attention for their potential in energy-efficient spin-to-charge conversion, enabled by strong spin-orbit coupling and spin-momentum locked surface states. Despite extensive research, the spin-to-charge conversion efficiency, usually characterized by the spin Hall angle ({\theta}SH), remains low at room temperature. In this work, we employed pulsed laser deposition to synthesize high-quality ternary topological insulators (Bi0.1Sb0.9)2Te3 thin films on magnetic insulator Y3Fe5O12. We find that the value of {\theta}SH reaches ~0.76 at room temperature and increases to ~0.9 as the Fermi level is tuned to cross topological surface states via electrical gating. Our findings provide an innovative approach to tailoring the spin-to-charge conversion in topological insulators and pave the way for their applications in energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Hysteretic responses of nanomechanical resonators based on crumpled few-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating two-dimensional materials occasionally results in crumpled membranes. Their complicated morphologies feature an abundance of folds, creases and wrinkles that make each crumpled membrane unique. Here, we prepare four nanomechanical resonators based on crumpled membranes of few-layer graphene and measure their static response and the spectrum of their dynamic response. We tune both responses with a dc voltage applied between the membrane and an underlying gate electrode. Surprisingly, we find that all four resonators exhibit hysteretic responses as the gate voltage is increased and then decreased. Concomitant discontinuities in the static response and in the vibrational resonant frequencies indicate a sudden change in the shape and in the tensile strain of the membranes. We also find that the hystereses can be removed and regular responses can be restored by annealing the resonators. We hypothesize that the hysteretic nature of the responses may originate from an interplay between the rugged morphology of the membranes and adsorbates trapped within the confine of the folds.</description>

      <title>Effect of a uniaxial strain on optical spin orientation in cubic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of a uniaxial strain on the optical spin orientation of a cubic semiconductor is investigated by calculating the valence wavefunctions, the optical oscillator strengths and the initial electron spin polarization for near resonant light excitation from heavy and light valence levels. A strain orientation along the [001], [111] or [-110] crystal direction and a circularly-polarized light excitation parallel or perpendicular to the strain are considered. For all these cases, the total conduction electron spin polarization has a universal character since i) the oscillator strengths do not depend on the magnitude of the strain but only on its sign. ii) Although the oscillator strengths strongly depend on the configuration, the conduction electron spin polarization generated by optical transitions from both the heavy and light valence levels induced by sigma + light excitation is in all cases equal to -0.5 as predicted by the simple atomic model. iii) The spin polarization generated by light excitation from heavy and light valence levels does not depend on the deformation tensor and on the valence deformation potential, except for a strain along [-110].</description>

      <title>Homogeneous doping of epitaxial graphene by Pb(111) islands: A magnetotransport study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity coupling is an effective approach for the functionalization of graphene. However, graphene's inertness inhibits the adsorption of closed films, thus favoring island growth, whose inhomogeneity might be reflected in the induced properties. In order to study the homogeneity of the doping profile induced by an inhomogeneous coverage and the spin orbit coupling (SOC) induced in graphene, we deposited Pb(111) islands with an average coverage of up to 30 ML on monolayer graphene (MLG) on SiC(0001) at room temperature (RT). We investigated the transport properties and the structure using magnetotransport, and scanning tunneling microscopy and low energy electron deflection, respectively. The Pb(111) islands act as donors, increasing the electron concentration of graphene by about $5\times10^{11}\;\text{ML}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}$. The doping was found to be homogeneous, in stark contrast to our previous results for Bi islands on MLG. Upon percolation of the Pb layer at around 5 ML, hole transport through the Pb islands has to be taken into account in order to describe the transport data. The Pb(111) islands do not induce any Rashba SOC, contrary to theoretical predictions for an interface between Pb(111) and graphene. Moreover, they seem to screen the defects in the graphene, resulting in a reduction of the intervalley scattering rate up to 5 ML.</description>

      <title>Chaotic quantum transport through spatially symmetric microstructures in the symplectic ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum transport through left-right symmetric chaotic cavities in the presence of the symplectic symmetry, is studied through the statistical distribution of the dimensionless conductance. With this particular point symmetry, their associated scattering matrices are blocky diagonalized by a rotation by an angle of $\pi/4$. Although the formulation is established for an arbitrary number channels N, we present explicit calculations for N=1 and N=2, the last one showing the weak anti-localization phenomenon due to the symplectic symmetry.</description>

      <title>Half-Metallic Fe/MgO Superlattice: An Ideal Candidate for Magnetic Tunnel Junction Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) based Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is poised to replace embedded Flash for advanced applications such as automotive microcontroller units. To achieve deeper technological adoption, MTJ needs to exhibit three key features: low magnetization (Ms), high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). Here, we theoretically show that when Fe/MgO multilayers are inserted into the fixed and free layers of the MTJ, these three conditions are simultaneously met. As the number of Fe/MgO multilayers in MTJ electrodes is increased, we find that the electron transport evolves from direct barrier tunneling of majority spin states to the resonant tunneling of minority spin states. Remarkably, the projected density of states (PDOS) of Fe/MgO superlattice at the MgO tunnel barrier exhibits half-metallicity near the Fermi Energy, where the minority states exist while the majority states are gapped out, resulting in astronomically high TMR.</description>

      <title>Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We find that the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic, has a spin-texture with an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy that is revealed in measurements of the in-plane critical field in the superconducting state, as well as from quantum corrections to the magnetoresistance in the normal state. This spin texture is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. Our findings demonstrate that magnetic overlayers provide a unique probe of spin textures and related phenomena in heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous magnon decay in two-dimensional altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that magnons in two-dimensional altermagnets can spontaneously decay at zero temperature. The decay rate is determined by quantum fluctuations and scattering processes involving the decay of a single magnon into three. These processes are kinematically allowed due to the convexity of the altermagnetic magnon dispersion. For small wavevectors $k$ the decay rate is proportional to $k^5$ with a direction-dependent prefactor which is maximal along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone. Moreover, for a given momentum only magnons with one specific chirality can spontaneously decay.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions in superconductors with chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological transitions in one dimensional superconductors that can harbor multiple edge Majorana bound states protected by chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry arises due to the structure of the internal spin degrees of freedom of the superconductor and it can be guided by the coupling of the superconductor with sources of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We then consider distinct regions of the phase diagram in the parameters space that are marked by gapless excitations in the spectrum and evaluate the conditions for inducing a topological transition. We show that for gapless chiral symmetric superconductors one can identify a class of physical perturbations that enable a gap opening in the spectrum, without breaking chirality, and turn the system into a topological state. This type of superconductor is dubbed marginal topological superconductor because an infinitesimally small perturbation is able to induce a transition into a topological nontrivial phase. To explicitly demonstrate and evaluate the character of the transitions from gapless to topological gapfull phases we explore different physical cases including $p$-wave superconductor in the presence of an applied magnetic field or proximity-coupled to a ferromagnet, and $s$-wave superconductor in a noncollinear magnetic ordering.</description>

Abstract: Photon indistinguishability, entanglement, and antibunching are key ingredients in quantum optics and photonics. Decay cascades in quantum emitters offer a simple method to create entangled photon-pairs with negligible multi-pair generation probability. However, the degree of indistinguishability of the photons emitted in a cascade is intrinsically limited by the lifetime ratio of the involved transitions. Here we show that, for the biexciton-exciton cascade in a quantum dot, this ratio can be widely tuned by an applied electric field. Hong-Ou-Mandel interference measurements of two subsequently emitted biexciton photons show that their indistinguishability increases with increasing field, following the theoretically predicted behavior. At the same time, the emission linewidth stays close to the transform-limit, favoring applications relying on the interference among photons emitted by different sources.</description>

Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions are pivotal for engineering topological superconductivity, yet are severely hindered by orbital effects induced by in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we introduce the generic topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions (TAJJs) by leveraging the intrinsic spin-polarized band splitting and zero net magnetization attributes of altermagnets. Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital effects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the junction. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEMs emerge in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave TAJJs but vanish in the $d_{xy}$-wave configuration, thereby establishing the crystallographic orientation angle $\theta$ of the altermagnet as a novel control parameter of topology. The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs provides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved measurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our proposal extends to high-$T_c$ platforms naturally. Overall, this work establishes altermagnets as a versatile paradigm for realizing topological superconductivity, bridging conceptual innovations with scalable quantum architectures devoid of orbital effects and stray fields.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are emergent non-equilibrium phases of periodically driven many-body systems, with potential applications ranging from quantum computing to sensing and metrology. There has been significant recent interest in understanding mechanisms leading to DTC formation and a search for novel DTC phases beyond subharmonic entrainment. Here, we report observation of multiple DTC phases in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) based on coupled graphene and silicon nitride membranes. We confirm the time-crystalline nature of these symmetry broken phases by establishing their many-body characters, long-range time and spatial order, and rigidity against parameter fluctuation or noise. Furthermore, we employ controlled mechanical strain to drive the transitions between phases with different symmetries, thereby mapping the emergent time-crystalline phase diagram. Overall, our work takes a step towards establishing time crystals as a system with complexity rivaling that of solid state crystals.</description>

Abstract: This paper uncovers the formation of topological edge polaritons that are protected by the presence of quantum vacuum. Such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons could be achieved in a system of neutral atomic lattice under appropriate interaction with a single photonic mode. In the absence of the light-matter coupling, the system is shown to be topologically trivial, which consequently does not support edge modes. By employing Floquet theory, the system is also found to be topologically trivial in the classical light limit, i.e., at very small light-matter coupling but very large number of photons. On the other hand, by treating both the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, the system becomes topologically nontrivial in the full (atomic+photonic) Hilbert space, which manifests itself as a pair of topological (almost) zero energy eigenstates localized near each lattice's edge and with very small mean photon number. Finally, the robustness of such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons against spatial disorder and counterrotating coupling effect is explicitly demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological Hall-like (THE-like) signals in disordered multidomain ferromagnets. Non-monotonic behavior in Hall resistivity, commonly attributed to topological spin textures such as skyrmions, is produced in a random resistor network model without any chirality. It arises from simple mechanisms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in combination with the domain wall scattering. By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced. Our results emphasize the need for careful analysis in distinguishing between true topological Hall effects and artifacts caused by domain disorders.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16032v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength squeezing, and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable polaritonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetic superconductors offer the possibility of exploring unconventional superconductivity, including topological states and finite-momentum superconductivity, with promising applications in spintronics and quantum information. However, a direct experimental confirmation of their existence remains elusive. In this work, we propose non-magnetic impurities as probes of the interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states whose spatial extension reflects the magnetic order of the substrate material. Depending on whether the impurity respects the bulk symmetries or not, these states form spin-degenerate or spin-split doublets. An external magnetic field aligned with the N\'eel vector can further control the doublet splitting. We further demonstrate that coupling between impurity states leads to a position-dependent, spin-sensitive hybridization, enabling a new approach for in-situ control of atomic-size quantum devices. These findings provide unambiguous experimental signatures of altermagnetic superconductivity accessible via local measurements like scanning tunneling microscopy and open new avenues for designing tunable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</description>

      <title>Measuring Non-Hermitian Topological Invariants Directly from Quench Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Friedel oscillations and chiral superconductivity in monolayer NbSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1965 Kohn and Luttinger proposed a genuine electronic mechanism for superconductivity. Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two electrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise to Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among the electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The nature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that superconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for screening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign, a key to the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The momentum-resolved gap equations predict two degenerate solutions at the critical temperature Tc, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing. Their complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry, provides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped chiral phase well below Tc is in excellent agreement with the spectral function extracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Andreev non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for open Josephson junctions from Green's functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of open Josephson junctions (JJs) through a minimal effective non-Hermitian (NH) approach derived from the equilibrium Green's function (GF) formalism. Specifically, we consider a JJ with a quantum dot barrier coupled to a normal metal reservoir. The coupling introduces an imaginary self-energy term in the JJ Hamiltonian which can be naturally accounted for in the NH formalism. While most approaches to similar problems work with the full junction Hamiltonian we propose a scheme for deriving an effective NH Hamiltonian for the Andreev levels only, that we compute from the singular part of the barrier GF. To establish the range of applicability of this NH model we benchmark our results for both the dot density of states and the supercurrent against exact GF predictions in different transport regimes. We find that, as a rule of thumb, the Andreev NH description is accurate when the spectral overlap between the Andreev bound states (ABS) and the near-gap continuum states is negligible, i.e. when the ABS energies lie sufficiently far from the superconducting gap relative to their line-width. This method not only highlights the effective physics of the JJ but also offers a scalable framework for studying large-size devices.</description>
