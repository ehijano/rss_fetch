      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Characterization of Absolutely Continuous functions defined over unbounded intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate and find a necessary and sufficient condition for a function to be absolutely continuous over $\mathbb{R}$ (denoted by $AC(\mathbb{R})$) or any unbounded interval in $\mathbb{R}$ . Note that the Lebesgue's Fundamental theorem of Calculus gives us a necessary and sufficient condition\cite{book:B} for a function defined over a closed interval [a,b] to be absolutely continuous ,and the condition is that the derivative of the function should be in $L^1_{loc}([a,b])$. However, we don't have any such sufficient condition on the derivative of a function that is absolutely continuous over unbounded intervals. One necessary condition is that the function must be locally absolutely continuous (denoted by $AC_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$), but it may not be globally absolutely continuous despite being locally absolutely continuous(we give an explicit example of this). \\ The theorem 1 in this paper gives us a necessary and sufficient condition for a function belonging in $AC_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$ to belong in $AC(\mathbb{R})$ in terms of its derivative and identifies the space to which the derivative of an $AC(\mathbb{R})$ function must belong to as $L^1_{G}(\mathbb{R})$ (a strict subspace of $L^1(\mathbb{R})$). \\ Moreover, we define a new space of functions called $L^1_{H}(\mathbb{R})$, and in theorem 2 we show that $L^1_G \subset L^1_H$, which helps us to find an easier criteria to check whether a function belonging to $AC_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$, belongs to $AC(\mathbb{R})$ or not. \\ Finally, we provide a Venn diagram to explicitly show the relation of the newly defined spaces $L^1_{G}(\mathbb{R})$ and $L^1_{H}(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to the spaces $L^1_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$, $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ and $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Almost preserved extreme points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of an almost preserved extreme point (APEP) of a set as a weakening of the concept of preserved extreme points, and we systematically study such points. As a main result, we prove that a Banach space $X$ has the Radon-Nikod\'{y}m property (RNP) if and only if every closed, convex, and bounded subset of the space has an APEP. Similarly, we prove that $X$ has the RNP if and only if the unit ball of every equivalent renorming has an APEP. We further investigate APEPs of the unit ball of classical Banach spaces, absolute sums, Lipschitz-free spaces, and projective tensor products. In the latter setting, our work also describes the preserved extreme points in the unit ball under the assumption that every bounded operator is compact, thereby partially solving an open problem.</description>

      <title>On the conjugate weight function and ultradifferentiable classes of entire functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the new notion of a conjugate weight function and provide a detailed study of this operation and its properties. Then we apply this knowledge to study classes of ultradifferentiable functions defined in terms of fast growing weight functions in the sense of Braun-Meise-Taylor and hence violating standard regularity requirements. Therefore, we transfer recent results shown by the author and D.N. Nenning from the weight sequence to the weight function framework. In order to proceed and to complete the picture we also define the conjugate associated weight matrix and investigate the relation to conjugate weight sequences via the corresponding associate weight functions. Finally, as it has already been done in the weight sequence case, we generalize results by M. Markin from the small Gevrey-setting and show how the corresponding non-standard ultradifferentiable function classes can be used to detect boundedness of normal linear operators on Hilbert spaces (associated with an evolution equation problem). On the one hand, when involving the weight matrix here the crucial information concerning regularity of the weak solutions can be expressed in terms of only one weight, namely of the given weight function. But, on the other hand, for the connection to the weighted entire setting the required conditions on the weight function are too restrictive in the general case.</description>

      <title>The linearized Floer equation in a chart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we are considering the Hessian of the area functional in a non-Darboux chart. This does not seem to have been considered before and leads to an interesting new mathematical structure which we introduce in this article and refer to as \emph{almost extendable weak Hessian~field}.
  Our main result is a Fredholm theorem for Robbin-Salamon operators associated to \emph{non-continuous} Hessians which we prove by taking advantage of this new structure.</description>

      <title>Stability of Maximum-Entropy Inference in Finite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study maximum-entropy inference for finite-dimensional quantum states under linear moment constraints. Given expectation values of finitely many observables, the feasible set of states is convex but typically non-unique. The maximum-entropy principle selects the Gibbs state that agrees with the data while remaining maximally unbiased. We prove that convergence of moments and entropy implies convergence of states in trace norm, derive explicit quantitative bounds linking data and entropy deviations to state distance, and show that these results are stable under unital completely positive maps. The analysis is self-contained and relies on convex duality, relative entropy, and Pinsker-type inequalities, providing a rigorous and unified foundation for finite-dimensional maximum-entropy inference.</description>

      <title>Spatially inhomogeneous two-cycles in an integrodifference equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the existence of a 2-cycle in an integrodifference equation with a Laplace kernel and logistic growth function, connecting two non-trivial fixed points of the second iterate of the logistic map in the non-chaotic regime. This model was first studied by Kot (1992), and the 2-cycle we establish corresponds to one numerically observed by Bourgeois, Leblanc, and Lutscher (2018) for the Ricker growth function. We provide strong evidence that the 2-cycle for the Ricker growth function can be rigorously proven using a similar approach. Finally, we present numerical results indicating that both 2-cycles exhibit spectral stability.</description>

      <title>Quantum-rigid random quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum graph $\mathcal{G}$ housed by a matrix algebra $M_n$ can be encoded as an operator system $\mathcal S=\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{G}}\le M_n$. There are two sensible notions of quantum automorphism group for any such: $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal G)$, capturing the quantum symmetries of the adjacency matrix $A:M_n\to M_n$ attached to $\mathcal{G}$, and $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal S\le M_n)$, the quantum group acting universally on $M_n$ so as to preserve its $C^*$ structure, standard trace, and subspace $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$. The two quantum groups coincide classically, but diverge in general. We nevertheless show that both are generically trivial in the sense that they are so for $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$ ranging over a non-empty Zariski-open set under all reasonable dimensional constraints on $\dim \mathcal{S}$ and $n$.
  This extends analogous prior results by the first and third authors to the effect that classical groups of still-quantum graphs are generically trivial, and offers a fully quantum counterpart to the familiar probabilistic almost-rigidity of finite graphs. An intermediate result sheds some light on the relationship between the two notions of quantum automorphism group, identifying the universal preserver of the quantum adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}$ with the quantum automorphism group not of $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$, but rather of the transpose $\mathcal{S}^t\le M_n$.</description>

      <title>New classes of compact-type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being motivated by the notions of $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn spaces and $k'$-spaces introduced by Arhangel'skii, the notion of sequential spaces and the study of Ascoli spaces, we introduce three new classes of compact-type spaces. They are defined by the possibility to attain each or some of boundary points $x$ of an open set $U$ by a sequence in $U$ converging to $x$ or by a relatively compact subset $A\subseteq U$ such that $x\in \overline{A}$. Relationships of the introduced classes with the classical classes (as, for example, the classes of $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn spaces, (sequentially) Ascoli spaces, $k_{\mathbb R}$-spaces, $s_{\mathbb R}$-spaces etc.) are given. We characterize these new classes of spaces and study them with respect to taking products, subspaces and quotients. In particular, we give new characterizations of $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn spaces and show that each feathered topological group is $\kappa$-Fr\'{e}chet--Urysohn. We describe locally compact abelian groups which endowed with the Bohr topology belong to one of the aforementioned classes. Numerous examples are given.</description>

Abstract: We define and study notions of amenability and skew-amenability of continuous actions of topological groups on compact topological spaces. Our main motivation is the question under what conditions amenability of a topological group passes to a closed subgroup. Other applications include the understanding of the universal minimal flow of various non-amenable groups.</description>

Abstract: We study the surjectivity of the Cauchy-Riemann and Laplace operators on certain weighted spaces of smooth functions of rapid decay on strip-like domains in the complex plane that are defined via weight function systems. We fully characterize when these operators are surjective on such function spaces in terms of a growth condition on the defining weight function systems.</description>

      <title>A Brenier Theorem on $(P_2 (...P_2(H)...), W_2 )$ and Applications to Adapted Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop Brenier theorems on iterated Wasserstein spaces. For a separable Hilbert space $H$ and $N\geq 1$, we construct a full-support probability $\Lambda$ on $P_2^{N}(H)= P_2(... P_2(H)...)$ that is transport regular: for every $Q$ with finite second moment, transporting $\Lambda$ to $Q$ with cost $W_2^2$ admits a unique optimizer, and this optimizer is of Monge type. The analysis rests on a characterization of optimal couplings on $P_2(H)$ and, more generally, on $P_2^{N}(H)$ via convex potentials on the Lions lift; in the latter case we employ a new adapted version of the lift tailored to the $N$-step structure. A key idea is a new identification between optimal-transport $c$-conjugation (with $c$ given by maximal covariance) and classical convex conjugation on the lift.
  A primary motivation comes from the adapted Wasserstein distance $AW_2$: our results yield a first Brenier theorem for $AW_2$ and characterize $AW_2^2$-optimal couplings through convex functionals on the space of $L_2$-processes.</description>
