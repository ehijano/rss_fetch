      <title>Graded Algebras over Polynomial Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a trivially graded polynomial ring $A=K[a_1,\dots,a_m]$ over a field $K$ and a positively graded polynomial ring $P=A[x_1,\dots,x_k]$, we study graded rings $R=P/I$, where $I$ is a homogeneous ideal in $P$ such that $I\cap A = \{0\}$. The corresponding morphism $\Theta: {\rm Spec}(R) \rightarrow {\rm Spec}(A) = \mathbb{A}^m_K$ is used to prove that ${\rm Spec}(R)$ is connected. Then we characterize and compute the following loci in $\mathbb{A}^m_K$: the set ${\rm Sing}_0(\Theta)$ of all points such that the corresponding point in the zero section of $\Theta$ is singular in ${\rm Spec}(R)$, the set ${\rm Sing}_v(\Theta)$ of all points $\Gamma$ such that the origin of the fiber $F_\Gamma$ of $\Theta$ is singular, and the set ${\rm Sing}_s(\Theta)$ of all points $\Gamma$ such that $\dim({\rm Sing}(F_\Gamma)) \ge 1$. These results are then used to study MaxDeg border basis schemes, as their coordinate rings are non-negatively graded by the total arrow degree and they have the required structure. In particular, we explicitly determine the singular loci for the $\mathcal{O}$-border basis schemes with $\mathcal{O}=\{1,x,y,z,z^2\}$ and $\mathcal{O} = \{1,x,y,z,yz\}$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity Versus Buchsbaumness of the special fiber cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(A,\mathfrak m)$ be a Noetherian local ring of dimension $d&gt;0$ with infinite residue field and $I$ an $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal. Let $\mathcal I$ be an $I$-good filtration. We study an equality of Hilbert coefficients, first given by Elias and Valla, versus passage of Buchsbaum property from the local ring to the blow-up algebras. Suppose $e_1(\mathcal I)-e_1(Q)=2e_0(\mathcal I)-2\ell(A/I_1)-\ell(I_1/(I_2+Q))$ where $Q\subseteq I$, a minimal reduction of $\mathcal I$, is a standard parameter ideal. Under some mild conditions, we prove that if $A$ is Buchsbaum (generalized Cohen-Macaulay respectively), then the associated graded ring $G(\mathcal I)$ is Buchsbaum (generalized Cohen-Macaulay respectively). Our results settle a question of Corso in general for an $I$-good filtration. Further, let $f_0(I)= e_1(I)-e_0(I)-e_1(Q)+\ell(A/I)+\mu(I)-d+1$ and $e_1(I)-e_1(Q)=2e_0(I)-2\ell(A/I)-\ell(I/(I^2+Q))$. We prove, under mild conditions, that (1) if $A$ is generalized Cohen-Macaulay, then the special fiber ring $F_{\mathfrak{m}}(I)$ is generalized Cohen-Macaulay; In addition, if depth of $A$ is positive, then depth of $F_{\mathfrak {m}}(I)$ is same as depth of $A$ and (2) if $A$ is Buchsbaum and depth A$\geq d-1$, then $F_{\mathfrak{m}}(I)$ is Buchsbaum and the $I$-invariant of $F_{\mathfrak{m}}(I)$ is same as that of $A$.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of valued Hahn groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06290v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hahn groups endowed with the canonical valuation play a fundamental role in the classification of valued abelian groups. In this paper we study the group of valuation (respectively order) preserving automorphisms of a Hahn group $G$. Under the assumption that $G$ satisfies some lifting property, we prove a structure theorem decomposing the automorphism group into a semidirect product of two notable subgroups. We characterise a class of Hahn groups satisfying the aforementioned lifting property. For some special cases we provide a matrix description of the automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher. In this paper, we present a new formulation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We also introduce the notion of an ``oracle function'', which is intended to determine whether evaluating a new variable is required to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function. Finally, we employ the multistep solving strategy in the cryptanalysis of the NSA's recently introduced low-latency block cipher Aradi, achieving a first full-round algebraic attack that exposes structural features in its symbolic model.</description>
