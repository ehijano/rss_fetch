      <title>Categorical approach to rigidity of Roe-like algebras of coarse spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any full and faithful $*$-functor between approximable categories of locally finite coarse spaces induces a coarse embedding between the underlying spaces. Furthermore, we establish a general characterisation of such $*$-functors between approximable categories and prove that the functor associating each locally finite coarse space with its approximable category is full and faithful.</description>

      <title>Corona algebras and strongly self-absorbing $\mathrm{C}^{\ast}$-dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article concerns the structure of $\mathrm{C}^{\ast}$-algebraic group actions induced on corona algebras from a given $\sigma$-unital $\mathrm{C}^{\ast}$-dynamical system over a locally compact group $G$. We prove that such actions satisfy the so-called dynamical folding property, which generalizes a fundamental property observed for corona algebras in works of Manuilov--Thomsen and Phillips--Weaver. We then focus on corona actions induced from $G$-$\mathrm{C}^{\ast}$-dynamics that are assumed to absorb a given strongly self-absorbing and unitarily regular $G$-action $\gamma$. It is proved that these corona actions are $\gamma$-saturated, which is a stronger property than being separably $\gamma$-stable. Conversely, if one assumes that the underlying $\mathrm{C}^{\ast}$-dynamics absorbs the trivial action on the compact operators, then $\gamma$-saturation of the corona action is equivalent to the original action being $\gamma$-absorbing. These results are a dynamical version of recent work by Farah and the third-named author.</description>

      <title>A few remarks on intermediate subalgebras of an inclusion of C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the angle between intermediate $C^*$-subalgebras of an inclusion of simple $C^*$-algebras with finite Watatani index is stable. The notion of angle is instrumental in providing a bound for the cardinality of the lattice of intermediate subalgebras for an irreducible inclusion of simple $C^*$-algebras. We improve the existing upper bound for the cardinality of this set.</description>

      <title>A rigidity framework for Roe-like algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this memoir we develop a framework to study rigidity problems for Roe-like C*-algebras of countably generated coarse spaces. The main goal is to give a complete and self-contained solution to the problem of C*-rigidity for proper (extended) metric spaces. Namely, we show that (stable) isomorphisms among Roe algebras always give rise to coarse equivalences. The material is organized as to provide a unified proof of C*-rigidity for Roe algebras, algebras of operators of controlled propagation, and algebras of quasi-local operators. We also prove a more refined C*-rigidity statement which has several additional applications. For instance, we can put the correspondence between coarse geometry and operator algebras in a categorical framework, and we prove that the outer automorphism groups of these C*-algebras are all isomorphic to the group of coarse equivalences of the coarse space.</description>

      <title>Central extensions and almost representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a sequence of unital tracial $C^*$-algebras $(A_n,\tau_n),$ we construct a canonical central extension of the unitary group $U(\ell^\infty (\mathbb{N},A_n)/c_0(\mathbb{N},A_n))$ by $Q(\mathbb{R})=c_0(\mathbb{N},\mathbb{R})/\mathbb{R}^\infty,$ using de la Harpe-Skandalis pre-determinant. For an asymptotic group homomorphism $\rho_n : \Gamma \to U(A_n),$ the corresponding pullback of the canonical central extension gives a 2-cohomology class in $H^2(\Gamma,Q(\mathbb{R}))$ which obstructs the perturbation of $(\rho_n)$ to a sequence of true homomorphisms of groups $\pi_n:\Gamma \to GL(A_n)$. The pairing of the obstruction class with elements of $H_2(\Gamma,\mathbb{Z})$ yields numerical invariants in $\tau_{n\,*} (K_0(A_n))$ that subsume the winding number invariants of Kazhdan, Exel and Loring. For generality, we allow bounded asymptotic homomorphisms to map the group $\Gamma$ into the general linear group of any sequence of tracial unital Banach algebras. In that case, the obstruction class belongs to $H^2(\Gamma,Q(\mathbb{C})),$ where $Q(\mathbb{C})=c_0(\mathbb{N},\mathbb{C})/\mathbb{C}^\infty.$ As an application, we show that 2-cohomology obstructs various stability properties under weaker assumptions than those found in existing literature. In particular we show that the full group $C^*$-algebra $C^*(\Gamma)$ of a discrete group $\Gamma$ is not $C^*$-stable if $H^2(\Gamma,\mathbb{R})\neq 0$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Truncation Kernels: Noncommutativity in $C^*$-algebraic Kernel Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17823v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $C^*$-algebra-valued kernels could pave the way for the next generation of kernel machines. To further our fundamental understanding of learning with $C^*$-algebraic kernels, we propose a new class of positive definite kernels based on the spectral truncation. We focus on kernels whose inputs and outputs are vectors or functions and generalize typical kernels by introducing the noncommutativity of the products appearing in the kernels. The noncommutativity induces interactions along the data function domain. We show that the proposed kernels fill the gap between existing separable and commutative kernels. We also propose a deep learning perspective to obtain a more flexible framework. The flexibility of the proposed class of kernels allows us to go beyond previous separable and commutative kernels, addressing two of the foremost issues regarding learning in vector-valued RKHSs, namely the choice of the kernel and the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories and shows that they form lattices under certain conditions, including all semisimple tensor categories. Furthermore, it extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors, proving that these lattices are finite under weak positivity constraints, encompassing all semisimple tensor categories as well. The primary tools employed in this paper are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories. Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>
