      <title>A Relative Liutex Method for Vortex Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relative Liutex vortex identification method is proposed in this study, together with its explicit mathematical formulation. The method is designed to identify vortical structures based solely on local flow-field information and is inherently Galilean invariant, ensuring robustness under different reference frames. To validate the proposed approach, a three-dimensional flat-plate boundary-layer transition case is investigated, in which the relative Liutex is systematically compared with conventional vortex identification methods, including the Q-criterion and the original Liutex method. The results show that the relative Liutex is capable of simultaneously capturing both strong and weak vortical structures. Importantly, its behavior cannot be interpreted as a simple superposition of Liutex iso-surfaces obtained using different threshold values. Instead, the relative Liutex provides a more selective and physically coherent identification of weak vortices, particularly in regions above the $\Lambda$-vortex and in the downstream hairpin-vortex structures, while effectively suppressing spurious and noise-induced features. These advantages arise from its formulation based on local velocity-gradient strength rather than a global vortical-intensity measure. Owing to its ability to consistently identify vortices across a wide range of intensities, the relative Liutex demonstrates strong potential for revealing complex vortex structures and underlying flow mechanisms in vortex-dominated flows.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Kinetic Energy Distribution and Heat Transfer in a Porous Layer Induced by Bluff Body Vortex Shedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a turbulent vortex impinges on a porous layer, it creates a complex multiscale interaction: the wake structures that form in the free fluid engage with the intricate geometry of the pores, and this interplay governs both the turbulent energy budget and the rate of heat transfer. Here we use interface-resolved two-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) to examine how a bluff-body wake impinges on an in-line porous array heated to maintain a constant wall temperature. The Reynolds number is fixed at Re = 10000, and the porosity is varied between $\phi$ = 0.80 and $\phi$ = 0.95. In all cases, the incoming von Karman vortices undergo rapid breakdown at the porous/fluid interface and do not persist as coherent macroscale structures within the porous layer. The interface instead acts as a spectral filter: large-scale wake energy is strongly attenuated, while turbulence is regenerated locally within the matrix via shear layers and microscale vortex shedding around individual obstacles. Thermal statistics show that the lower-porosity medium produces higher local and surface-averaged Nusselt numbers across representative interface and interior locations. This is consistent with the stronger shear and enhanced fluid/solid thermal interaction associated with the larger surface-area-to-volume ratio. These results clarify the mechanisms by which wake-driven turbulence is converted into pore-scale motions and how porosity tunes the balance between turbulence attenuation and convective heat transfer in porous coatings and inserts.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of potential flow past bodies of irregular shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid flow past one or more solid bodies is a fundamental problem of much practical importance. Standard solutions of simplified problems involving incompressible inviscid irrotational flow past common geometries such as circular cylinders and airfoils are commonly available. This work presents exact analysis of a potential flow problem involving fluid flow past one or more bodies of irregular shapes. The problem is solved by expressing the shape of each body using Heaviside functions, and writing the potential function as an eigenfunction-based series. Using the properties of Heaviside functions, the series coefficients are determined by deriving a set of linear algebraic equations that govern the coefficients. Benchmarking of the analytical technique against well-known solutions of standard problems is carried out, showing excellent agreement. Good agreement with past work on the specific problem of potential flow past multiple circular cylinders further establishes the accuracy of the analytical technique. Illustrative problems of flow past complicated geometries are solved. Implementation aspects and limitations of the analytical technique are discussed.</description>

      <title>Turbulence enhances bird tail aerodynamic performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is omnipresent in the atmosphere and a long-standing scientific conundrum that makes flight complex. This complexity is little understood; surprisingly, when turbulence arises, air vehicles struggle while birds seem to thrive. Birds often encounter intense turbulence during takeoff and landing, because of turbulent boundary layer effects. During landing, birds respond by fanning their tail over a wide range of spreads and angles of attack. How their tail functions aerodynamically under these conditions is little understood. Here, we use a bio-hybrid feathered robot model of a pigeon tail in a wind tunnel to compare its aerodynamics in laminar versus turbulent flow. We measured the lift and drag forces generated by the tail as a function of angle of attack, tail spread, and flow condition. We found tail spread scarcely changes tail aerodynamic lift and drag force coefficients, despite large aspect ratio variations. Consequently, tail spread primarily changes force via tail area modulation, simplifying flight control. The effect of laminar versus turbulent flow is pronounced; at the same tail spread and angle of attack, turbulence increases lift and drag by approximately a factor two. Quantitative flow measurement analysis with proper orthogonal decomposition shows force enhancement is linked to modifications in the spatial and temporal structure of the wake. The results suggest a wake instability that arises in laminar flow is suppressed in turbulent flow, which enhances tail efficiency, benefiting flight control. These insights may inspire engineers to design aerial vehicle tails with improved flight control in turbulence.</description>

      <title>Transport and orientation of anisotropic particles settling in surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the translation and orientation dynamics of an anisotropic particle settling in monochromatic linear surface gravity waves. Recent work has shown that a neutrally buoyant spheroid attains a preferred mean orientation in such wave fields, independent of its initial state and determined solely by its aspect ratio. Comparing the settling parameter $\mathrm{Sv}$, the ratio of settling speed to wave speed, with the asymptotically small wave steepness $\epsilon$, we investigate the long time dynamics of a negatively buoyant particle. We examine the transition from aspect ratio-dependent equilibrium orientation in the weak settling regime ($\mathrm{Sv} \ll \epsilon^2$) to initial-condition-dependent alignment in the strong settling limit ($\mathrm{Sv} \gg 1$). Since translation and orientation are coupled for anisotropic particles, we use orientation dynamics to predict net horizontal transport. Fluid inertia induces an inertial torque that breaks the Stokesian degeneracy and drives broadside alignment. We analyze the influence of this torque on drift and alignment rate as functions of settling and wave parameters. Finally, we evaluate finite-size effects through the parameter $\sigma$, showing that a neutrally buoyant finite-size spheroid exhibits $\sigma$-dependent drift, validating the finite-size approximation when the spheroid size approaches the wavelength.</description>

      <title>Hovering efficiency optimization of the cycloidal propeller with end plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cycloidal propellers are known for their omnidirectional vectored thrust, enabling smooth transitions between hovering and forward flight, making them ideal for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. However, cycloidal propellers tend to have lower hovering efficiency compared to screw propellers. Adding end plates to the blade tips can enhance hovering efficiency by reducing blade tip vortices. But the impact of these end plates and the optimal design for cycloidal propellers incorporating them have not been thoroughly studied. This paper seeks to optimize hovering efficiency and develop design theories for cycloidal propellers with end plates. Extensive force measurement experiments are conducted to identify designs with optimal hovering efficiency. The sliding mesh technique is employed to solve the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations for a detailed analysis. Experimental results indicate that the designs with end plates generally achieve significantly better hovering efficiency than those without end plates. End plates help to maintain hovering efficiency, even though the blade aspect ratio is as small as 1.5. The designs with stationary end plates are superior to those with rotating end plates because rotation introduces additional torque caused by the friction force. Designs featuring thick end plates outperform those with thin end plates, as the rounded edges can eliminate end plate vortices. The best design features stationary thick end plates, a chord-to-radius ratio of 0.65, and a large pitching amplitude of 40 degrees. It achieves a hovering efficiency of 0.72 with a blade aspect ratio of 3, which is comparable to that of helicopters. In contrast, for the cases without end plates, the highest hovering efficiency is merely 0.54.</description>

      <title>Beyond chaos: fluctuations, anomalies and spontaneous stochasticity in fluid turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this perspective, we consider the development of statistical hydrodynamics, focusing on the way in which the intrinsic stochasticity of turbulent phenomena was identified and is being explored. A major purpose of our discussion is to bring out the role of anomalies in turbulent phenomena, in ways that are not usually done, and to emphasize how the description of turbulent phenomena requires delicate considerations of asymptotic limits. The scope of our narrative includes selected historical aspects that are not usually emphasized, primarily due to G.I. Taylor, as well as discussions of certain aspects of the laminar-turbulent transition, the behaviour of turbulent drag at intermediate Reynolds numbers, and the statistics of fully-developed turbulence that exhibit spontaneous stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic enhancement of particle collision rates in atmospheric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisional growth of tiny particles is a fundamental process governing the growth of cloud droplets and the aggregation of ash particles in volcanic plumes, with direct implications for precipitation formation, cloud lifetime, and ash plume dynamics. The particles in these scenarios often carry electric charges. In this study, we investigate the collision dynamics of a pair of like charged dielectric spheres subjected to a uniaxial compressional flow, an important linear flow that captures key features of atmospheric straining motions. Finite particle size leads to electrostatic interactions that deviate from the point charge approximation, resulting in far field repulsion and near-field attraction, which in turn generate nontrivial particle trajectories and critical collision thresholds. For certain combinations of charge and size, the interplay between hydrodynamic and electrostatic forces creates strong radially inward particle relative velocities that substantially alter particle pair dynamics and modify the conditions required for contact. For uncharged particles, collision efficiency increases monotonically with particle size ratio. However, in the presence of electrostatic forces with high charge ratio values, the collision efficiency exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence, attaining a maximum at small size ratios and decreasing as the ratio increases, with a crossover beyond which larger particles become less favorable for collision. These results demonstrate that the same polarity charges on finite sized atmospheric particles do not necessarily inhibit collisions. Instead, they can enhance collisional growth for specific charge and size ratio combinations, revealing counterintuitive pathways relevant to cloud microphysical processes and volcanic ash aggregation in electrified atmospheric environments.</description>

      <title>Generalization Capability of Deep Learning for Predicting Drag Reduction in Pulsating Turbulent Pipe Flow with Arbitrary Acceleration and Deceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatiotemporal evolution of pulsating turbulent pipe flow was predicted by deep learning. A convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) were employed for long-term prediction by recursively predicting the local temporal evolution. To enhance prediction, physical components such as wall shear stress were informed into the training process. The datasets were obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS). The model was trained exclusively on a limited set of sinusoidal pulsating flows driven by pressure gradients defined by their period and amplitude. Subsequently, 36 pulsating flows with arbitrary non-sinusoidal acceleration and deceleration were predicted to evaluate the generalization capability, defined as the predictive performance on unseen data during training. The model successfully predicted drag reduction rates ranging from $-1\%$ to $86\%$, with a mean absolute error of 9.2. This predictive performance for unseen pulsations indicates that local temporal prediction plays a central role, rather than learning the global profile of the pulsating waveforms. This implication was quantitatively verified by analyzing the differences in periodic $C_f$--$Re_b$ trajectories between the training and test datasets, demonstrating that flows exhibiting local similarity to the training data are more predictable. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that flows exhibiting intermittent laminar--turbulent transition and relaminarization become predictable when such regimes are incorporated into the training data. The results indicate that accurate prediction is achievable provided that the training data sufficiently cover the local flow-state space, highlighting the importance of appropriate training data selection for generalized flow prediction.</description>

      <title>On Prats' problem with anomalous diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Prats' problem of flow instability in a horizontal porous channel saturated by a fluid subject to a buoyancy force is reconsidered. In the original formulation, the driving buoyancy force results from thermal diffusion. This study, however, substitutes thermal diffusion with mass diffusion. Furthermore, the usual scheme of mass diffusion is extended to comprehend also the anomalous phenomena of superdiffusion or subdiffusion. Such phenomena are modelled via a time-dependent mass diffusivity which yields a significant change in the formulation of the stability eigenvalue problem. In particular, the ordinary differential equations governing the time evolution of the perturbations acting on the base throughflow become non-autonomous. This makes a significant difference in the discussion of the conditions leading to instability, with a marked effect of the anomaly in the mass diffusion process. The transition from convective to absolute instability for subdiffusion processes is also addressed.</description>

      <title>Learning Temporally Consistent Turbulence Between Sparse Snapshots via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical accuracy of temporally interpolated spatiotemporal flow sequences between sparse, decorrelated snapshots of turbulent flow fields using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The developed method is presented as a proof-of-concept generative surrogate for reconstructing coherent turbulent dynamics between sparse snapshots, demonstrated on a 2D Kolmogorov Flow, and a 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI). We analyse the generated flow sequences through the lens of statistical turbulence, examining the time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy spectra over generated sequences, and temporal decay of turbulent structures. For the non-stationary Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability, we assess the ability of the proposed method to capture evolving flow statistics across the most strongly time-varying flow regime. We additionally examine instantaneous fields and physically motivated metrics at key stages of the KHI flow evolution.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the effect of centre-body geometry on the dynamics of an isothermal, non-reacting swirl combustor through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Two different central body shapes were considered in a lab-scale combustor configuration, modelled as transient, incompressible flow using the SST k-omega turbulence model. The numerical model was validated against experimental velocity data from literature to ensure accuracy. Cross-spectral analysis techniques were employed to characterise the coherent dynamics of the flow, providing insight into the influence of geometry on unsteady swirl dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interaction of a Vortex Pair with a Polymeric Fluid Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of vortical structures with boundaries has been extensively studied in Newtonian fluids, where conditions such as no slip walls, free surfaces, or contaminated surfaces dictate whether vortices rebound, dissipate, or generate secondary structures. In this work, we investigate a related but fundamentally different problem: the interaction of a vortex pair with a finite, non uniform layer of polymeric fluid. Numerical simulations employing the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic Peterlin model are used to examine the effects of polymer concentration, relaxation time, polymer layer thickness, and maximum polymer extension on the evolution of kinetic energy and enstrophy. The results show that, while the polymeric fluid dissipates vortical motion, vortex polymer layer interactions can also generate new coherent structures. In particular, the formation of secondary and tertiary vortices coincides with transient increases in kinetic energy, a behavior absent in the Newtonian case. Unlike classical vortex boundary interactions, where the primary vortex survives, we find that under certain conditions it completely dissipates upon interaction with the polymer layer. These findings emphasize that fluids with non-uniform polymer concentrations, act not only as dissipative agents but also as sources of vorticity, extending the traditional view of polymer induced drag reduction and providing new insight into vortex polymer interactions.</description>

      <title>Simulations of two-dimensional single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor Instability using front-tracking/ghost-fluid method: comparison to experiments and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) is simulated using an accurate and robust front-tracking/ghost-fluid method (FT/GFM) with high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme. We compare our numerical results with the single-mode RTI experiments of Renoult, Rosenblatt and Carles (2015). The time evolution of the interface between two immiscible fluids and the effects of surface tension on the growth of the amplitude and asymmetry of the perturbed interface are examined for the initial wavelength 1 cm and the Atwood number A=0.29. The important features of RTI flows such as interface profiles, bubble/spike penetration and velocities show good agreement between experiments and simulations of immiscible fluids with surface tension. The velocity vector fields for the bubble and spike in the linear and nonlinear regimes are consistent with the theory for the single wavelength perturbation.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Machine Learning of Lattice Boltzmann Collision Operators for Fluid Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We attempt the use of a unitary operator to approximate the lattice Boltzmann collision operator. We use a modified amplitude encoding to bypass the renormalization that would have required classical processing at every step (thus eroding any quantum advantage to be had). We describe the hard-wiring of the lattice Boltzmann symmetries into the quantum circuit and show that, for the specific case of the cavity flow, approximating the nonlinear system is limited to low velocities. These findings may help us understand better the possibilities of nonlinear simulations on a quantum computer, and also pave the way for a discussion on how quantum machine learning might be harnessed to address more complex problems.</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis of Disease Progression in Pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</title>

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive cardiopulmonary disease that leads to increased pulmonary pressures, vascular remodeling, and eventual right ventricular (RV) failure. Pediatric PAH remains understudied due to limited data and the lack of targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In this study, we developed and calibrated multi-scale, patient-specific cardiovascular models for four pediatric PAH patients using longitudinal MRI and catheterization data collected approximately two years apart. Using the CRIMSON simulation framework, we coupled three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models of the pulmonary arteries with zero-dimensional (0D) lumped-parameter heart and Windkessel models to simulate patient hemodynamics. An automated Python-based optimizer was developed to calibrate boundary conditions by minimizing discrepancies between simulated and clinical metrics, reducing calibration time from weeks to days. Model-derived metrics such as arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity, resistance, and compliance were found to align with clinical indicators of disease severity and progression. Our findings demonstrate that computational modeling can non-invasively capture patient-specific hemodynamic adaptation over time, offering a promising tool for monitoring pediatric PAH and informing future treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Bounds on dissipation in three-dimensional planar shear flows: reduction to two-dimensional problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bounds on turbulent averages in shear flows can be derived from the Navier--Stokes equations by a mathematical approach called the background method. Bounds that are optimal within this method can be computed at each Reynolds number Re by numerically optimizing subject to a spectral constraint, which requires a quadratic integral to be nonnegative for all possible velocity fields. Past authors have eased computations by enforcing the spectral constraint only for streamwise-invariant (2.5D) velocity fields, assuming this gives the same result as enforcing it for three-dimensional (3D) fields. Here we compute optimal bounds over 2.5D fields and then verify, without doing computations over 3D fields, that the bounds indeed apply to 3D flows. One way is to directly check that an optimizer computed using 2.5D fields satisfies the spectral constraint for all 3D fields. A second way uses a criterion we derive that is based on a theorem of Busse (ARMA 47:28, 1972) for energy stability analysis of models with certain symmetry. The advantage of checking this criterion, as opposed to directly checking the 3D constraint, is lower computational cost and natural extrapolation of the criterion to large Re. We compute optimal upper bounds on friction coefficients for the wall-bounded Kolmogorov flow known as Waleffe flow, and for plane Couette flow. This requires lower bounds on dissipation in the first model and upper bounds in the second. For Waleffe flow, all bounds computed using 2.5D fields satisfy our criterion, so they hold for 3D flows. For Couette flow, where bounds have been previously computed using 2.5D fields by Plasting &amp; Kerswell (JFM 477:363, 2003), our criterion holds only up to moderate Re, so at larger Re we directly verify the 3D spectral constraint. Over the Re range of our computations, this confirms the assumption by Plasting &amp; Kerswell that their bounds hold for 3D flows.</description>

      <title>Backward similarity solution of the Boussinesq groundwater equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer resting on a horizontal impermeable layer with a boundary condition of a rapid increase in the source water level is considered in this work. The newly introduced condition, referred to as the backward power-law head condition, represents a situation where the water level in the adjacent water body increases more rapidly than do conventional problems, which can only represent a situation akin to a traveling wave under rising water level conditions, given its consideration of infinite time. This problem admits the similarity transformation which allows the nonlinear partial differential equation to be converted into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation via the Boltzmann transformation. The reduced boundary value problem is interpreted as the initial value problem for a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE), which can be numerically solved via Shampine's method. The numerical solutions are in good agreement with Kalashinikov's special solution, which is also introduced into the Boussinesq equation. We find that the solution is consistent with the limit of the forward power-law head condition. The new approximate analytical solution and the associated wetting front position are derived by assuming that the solution has the form of quadratic polynomials, which enables the description of the time progression of a real front position. The obtained approximation is compared to Shampine's solution to check the accuracy. Furthermore, the finite element method is applied to the original partial differential equation (PDE), which validates Shampine's solution for use as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>GIMLET: Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for discovering constitutive relations in models of fluid flow and scalar transport. Under the assumption that velocity and/or scalar fields are measured, our approach infers unknown closure terms in the governing equations as neural networks. The target to be discovered is the constitutive relations only, while the temporal derivative, convective transport terms, and pressure-gradient term in the governing equations are prescribed. The formulation is rooted in a variational principle from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, where the dynamics is defined by a free-energy functional and a dissipation functional. The unknown constitutive terms arise as functional derivatives of these functionals with respect to the state variables. To enable a flexible and structured model discovery, the free-energy and dissipation functionals are parameterized using neural networks, while their functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation. This construction enforces thermodynamic consistency by design, guaranteeing monotonic decay of the total free energy and non-negative entropy production. The resulting method, termed GIMLET (Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics), avoids reliance on a predefined library of candidate functions, unlike sparse regression or symbolic identification approaches. The learned models are generalizable in that functionals identified from one dataset can be transferred to distinct datasets governed by the same underlying equations. Moreover, the inferred free-energy and dissipation functions provide direct physical interpretability of the learned dynamics. The framework is demonstrated on several benchmark systems, including the viscous Burgers equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <title>Electrode Geometry Optimization in Vortex-Type Seawater Magnetohydrodynamic Generators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) generators present a promising pathway for clean energy conversion by directly transforming conductive fluids' kinetic energy into electricity. This study investigates the impact of electrode geometry modifications on the performance of a vortex-type seawater MHD generator. Three electrode designs, partial, whole-area, and spiral, are analyzed through combined analytical and numerical simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. The study focuses on internal resistance reduction, current density distribution, and overall power output. The results indicate that electrode area and spacing are critical determinants of performance. The whole-area electrode achieves the highest output, with a 155 percent increase in power compared to the baseline partial electrode. The spiral electrode demonstrates reduced internal resistance and improved current flow but exhibits lower open-circuit voltage due to reduced electrode spacing. The simulations show strong agreement with theoretical models, with deviations of less than 4 percent in open-circuit voltage predictions. These findings highlight the importance of geometric optimization for advancing seawater-based MHD generators as sustainable and efficient energy conversion systems.</description>

      <title>Radiation forces and torques in optics and acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical action of various kinds of waves has been recognized for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the turn of the 20th century, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second surge occurred in the past several decades, driven by technological breakthroughs: the invention of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wave fields. This resulted in major discoveries, including optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic manipulation of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Nowadays, radiation forces and torques underpin numerous applications: optical and acoustic tweezers, acoustofluidic sorting of biological cells, optomechanical systems operating in both classical and quantum regimes, solar sails, quantum simulators, volumetric displays, etc. In this review, we present a unifying perspective on optical and acoustic forces and torques acting on various particles, addressing both their theoretical foundations and key applications. Our approach relies on the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities of wave fields and the principal forces and torques exerted on small particles. Moreover, we describe important cases of nontrivial (e.g., lateral and pulling) forces and complex (e.g., chiral and anisotropic) particles. We also highlight significant experimental achievements involving optical and acoustic manipulation in structured wave fields. Our aim is to illuminate the common fundamental origins and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and advancing the development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Deformation and organization of droplet-encapsulated soft beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many biological, culinary, and engineering processes lead to the co-encapsulation of several soft particles within a liquid interface. In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.</description>
