      <title>Coincident Learning for Beam-based RF Station Fault Identification Using Phase Information at the SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies in radio-frequency (RF) stations can result in unplanned downtime and performance degradation in linear accelerators such as SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Detecting these anomalies is challenging due to the complexity of accelerator systems, high data volume, and scarcity of labeled fault data. Prior work identified faults using beam-based detection, combining RF amplitude and beam-position monitor data. Due to the simplicity of the RF amplitude data, classical methods are sufficient to identify faults, but the recall is constrained by the low-frequency and asynchronous characteristics of the data. In this work, we leverage high-frequency, time-synchronous RF phase data to enhance anomaly detection in the LCLS accelerator. Due to the complexity of phase data, classical methods fail, and we instead train deep neural networks within the Coincident Anomaly Detection (CoAD) framework. We find that applying CoAD to phase data detects nearly three times as many anomalies as when applied to amplitude data, while achieving broader coverage across RF stations. Furthermore, the rich structure of phase data enables us to cluster anomalies into distinct physical categories. Through the integration of auxiliary system status bits, we link clusters to specific fault signatures, providing additional granularity for uncovering the root cause of faults. We also investigate interpretability via Shapley values, confirming that the learned models focus on the most informative regions of the data and providing insight for cases where the model makes mistakes. This work demonstrates that phase-based anomaly detection for RF stations improves both diagnostic coverage and root cause analysis in accelerator systems and that deep neural networks are essential for effective analysis.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency Plasma-Based Compressor for Ultrafast Soft X-ray Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of intense, femtosecond-scale X-ray pulses is crucial for probing matter under extreme temporal and field conditions. Current chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) techniques in free-electron lasers (FELs), however, face efficiency limitations in the soft X-ray regime due to the inherent constraints of conventional optical compressors. To address this challenge, we propose a high-efficiency plasma-based compressor utilizing highly ionized noble gas plasma. Exploiting strong refractive index dispersion near ionic resonances, this scheme achieves over 70% transmission efficiency around 5.2 nm, and is extendable to other highly charged ions for operation across discrete bands in the soft X-ray to vacuum ultraviolet. Simulations demonstrate that a 25 fs FEL pulse can be compressed to 1.4 fs with peak power boosted to over 100 GW, while maintaining high energy throughput. This approach overcomes the long-standing efficiency bottleneck of soft X-ray CPA and opens a scalable path toward compact, high-brightness attosecond FEL sources.</description>

      <title>Resonant photon scattering in the presence of external fields and its applications for the Gamma Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This theoretical study explores resonant elastic photon scattering in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, motivated by potential applications in storage ring experiments, such as the Gamma Factory project at CERN. In this framework, resonant scattering involves head-on collisions of relativistic ion beams and counter-propagating laser photons, leading to a strong enhancement of the external field strength due to the Lorentz transformation between ion rest and laboratory frame. Calculations for He-like Ca ions reveal a notable impact of the external fields on the scattering rate as well as the angular distribution and polarization of emitted photons. This opens interesting avenues for diverse applications for the Gamma Factory project, such as as resonance condition tuning, beam cooling, and polarization control.</description>
