      <title>Spiking Neural Network Accelerator Architecture for Differential-Time Representation using Learned Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have garnered attention over recent years due to their increased energy efficiency and advantages in terms of operational complexity compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Two important questions when implementing SNNs are how to best encode existing data into spike trains and how to efficiently process these spike trains in hardware. This paper addresses both of these problems by incorporating the encoding into the learning process, thus allowing the network to learn the spike encoding alongside the weights. Furthermore, this paper proposes a hardware architecture based on a recently introduced differential-time representation for spike trains allowing decoupling of spike time and processing time. Together these contributions lead to a feedforward SNN using only Leaky-Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons that surpasses 99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset while still being implementable on medium-sized FPGAs with inference times of less than 295us.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Evolutionary Game Theory for More Personalized Cancer Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized cancer treatment is revolutionizing oncology by leveraging precision medicine and advanced computational techniques to tailor therapies to individual patients. Despite its transformative potential, challenges such as limited generalizability, interpretability, and reproducibility of predictive models hinder its integration into clinical practice. Current methodologies often rely on black-box machine learning models, which, while accurate, lack the transparency needed for clinician trust and real-world application. This paper proposes the development of an innovative framework that bridges Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) to address these limitations. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs offer interpretable, edge-based neural architectures capable of modeling complex biological systems with unprecedented adaptability. Their integration into the EGT framework enables dynamic modeling of cancer progression and treatment responses. By combining KAN's computational precision with EGT's mechanistic insights, this hybrid approach promises to enhance predictive accuracy, scalability, and clinical usability.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-Art Transformer Models for Image Super-Resolution: Techniques, Challenges, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to recover a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart, which has been affected by a specific degradation process. This is achieved by enhancing detail and visual quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based methods have remolded image super-resolution by enabling high-quality reconstructions surpassing previous deep-learning approaches like CNN and GAN-based. This effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods, such as limited receptive fields, poor global context capture, and challenges in high-frequency detail recovery. Additionally, the paper reviews recent trends and advancements in transformer-based SR models, exploring various innovative techniques and architectures that combine transformers with traditional networks to balance global and local contexts. These neoteric methods are critically analyzed, revealing promising yet unexplored gaps and potential directions for future research. Several visualizations of models and techniques are included to foster a holistic understanding of recent trends. This work seeks to offer a structured roadmap for researchers at the forefront of deep learning, specifically exploring the impact of transformers on super-resolution techniques.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Orthogonal Convolution Scheme for Efficient and Flexible CNN Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal convolutional layers are the workhorse of multiple areas in machine learning, such as adversarial robustness, normalizing flows, GANs, and Lipschitzconstrained models. Their ability to preserve norms and ensure stable gradient propagation makes them valuable for a large range of problems. Despite their promise, the deployment of orthogonal convolution in large-scale applications is a significant challenge due to computational overhead and limited support for modern features like strides, dilations, group convolutions, and transposed convolutions.In this paper, we introduce AOC (Adaptative Orthogonal Convolution), a scalable method for constructing orthogonal convolutions, effectively overcoming these limitations. This advancement unlocks the construction of architectures that were previously considered impractical. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method produces expressive models that become increasingly efficient as they scale. To foster further advancement, we provide an open-source library implementing this method, available at https://github.com/thib-s/orthogonium.</description>

      <title>Many-Objective Neuroevolution for Testing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating tests for games is challenging due to the high degree of randomisation inherent to games and hard-to-reach program states that require sophisticated gameplay. The test generator NEATEST tackles these challenges by combining search-based software testing principles with neuroevolution to optimise neural networks that serve as test cases. However, since NEATEST is designed as a single-objective algorithm, it may require a long time to cover fairly simple program states or may even get stuck trying to reach unreachable program states. In order to resolve these shortcomings of NEATEST, this work aims to transform the algorithm into a many-objective search algorithm that targets several program states simultaneously. To this end, we combine the neuroevolution algorithm NEATEST with the two established search-based software testing algorithms, MIO and MOSA. Moreover, we adapt the existing many-objective neuroevolution algorithm NEWS/D to serve as a test generator. Our experiments on a dataset of 20 SCRATCH programs show that extending NEATEST to target several objectives simultaneously increases the average branch coverage from 75.88% to 81.33% while reducing the required search time by 93.28%.</description>

      <title>Set-based Neural Network Encoding Without Weight Tying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network weight encoding method for network property prediction that utilizes set-to-set and set-to-vector functions to efficiently encode neural network parameters. Our approach is capable of encoding neural networks in a model zoo of mixed architecture and different parameter sizes as opposed to previous approaches that require custom encoding models for different architectures. Furthermore, our \textbf{S}et-based \textbf{N}eural network \textbf{E}ncoder (SNE) takes into consideration the hierarchical computational structure of neural networks. To respect symmetries inherent in network weight space, we utilize Logit Invariance to learn the required minimal invariance properties. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{pad-chunk-encode} pipeline to efficiently encode neural network layers that is adjustable to computational and memory constraints. We also introduce two new tasks for neural network property prediction: cross-dataset and cross-architecture. In cross-dataset property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors generalize across model zoos trained on different datasets but of the same architecture. In cross-architecture property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors transfer to model zoos of different architecture not seen during training. We show that SNE outperforms the relevant baselines on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>TrIM, Triangular Input Movement Systolic Array for Convolutional Neural Networks: Architecture and Hardware Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern hardware architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), other than targeting high performance, aim at dissipating limited energy. Reducing the data movement cost between the computing cores and the memory is a way to mitigate the energy consumption. Systolic arrays are suitable architectures to achieve this objective: they use multiple processing elements that communicate each other to maximize data utilization, based on proper dataflows like the weight stationary and row stationary. Motivated by this, we have proposed TrIM, an innovative dataflow based on a triangular movement of inputs, and capable to reduce the number of memory accesses by one order of magnitude when compared to state-of-the-art systolic arrays. In this paper, we present a TrIM-based hardware architecture for CNNs. As a showcase, the accelerator is implemented onto a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to execute the VGG-16 and AlexNet CNNs. The architecture achieves a peak throughput of 453.6 Giga Operations per Second, outperforming a state-of-the-art row stationary systolic array up to ~3x in terms of memory accesses, and being up to ~11.9x more energy-efficient than other FPGA accelerators.</description>
