      <title>Causes of evolutionary divergence in prostate cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer progression involves the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations that cumulatively shape the tumour phenotype. In prostate cancer, tumours can follow divergent evolutionary trajectories that lead to distinct subtypes, but the causes of this divergence remain unclear. While causal inference could elucidate the factors involved, conventional methods are unsuitable due to the possibility of unobserved confounders and ambiguity in the direction of causality. Here, we propose a method that circumvents these issues and apply it to genomic data from 829 prostate cancer patients. We identify several genetic alterations that drive divergence as well as others that prevent this transition, locking tumours into one trajectory. Further analysis reveals that these genetic alterations may cause each other, implying a positive-feedback loop that accelerates divergence. Our findings provide insights into how cancer subtypes emerge and offer a foundation for genomic surveillance strategies aimed at monitoring the progression of prostate cancer.</description>

      <title>Integrating Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval Augmented Generation Enhances Rare Disease Diagnosis from Clinical Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.</description>

      <title>Computational identification of ketone metabolism as a key regulator of sleep stability and circadian dynamics via real-time metabolic profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metabolism plays a crucial role in sleep regulation, yet its effects are challenging to track in real time. This study introduces a machine learning-based framework to analyze sleep patterns and identify how metabolic changes influence sleep at specific time points. We first established that sleep periods in Drosophila melanogaster function independently, with no causal relationship between different sleep episodes. Using gradient boosting models and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, we quantified the influence of time-dependent sleep features. Causal inference and autocorrelation analyses further confirmed that sleep states at different times are statistically independent, providing a robust foundation for exploring metabolic effects on sleep. Applying this framework to flies with altered monocarboxylate transporter 2 expression, we found that changes in ketone transport modified sleep stability and disrupted transitions between day and night sleep. In an Alzheimers disease model, metabolic interventions such as beta hydroxybutyrate supplementation and intermittent fasting selectively influenced the timing of day to night transitions rather than uniformly altering sleep duration. Autoencoder based similarity scoring and wavelet analysis reinforced that metabolic effects on sleep were highly time dependent. This study presents a novel approach to studying sleep-metabolism interactions, revealing that metabolic states exert their strongest influence at distinct time points, shaping sleep stability and circadian transitions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Cox model with graph-structured variable selection priors for multi-omics biomarker identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important goal in cancer research is the survival prognosis of a patient based on a minimal panel of genomic and molecular markers such as genes or proteins. Purely data-driven models without any biological knowledge can produce non-interpretable results. We propose a penalized semiparametric Bayesian Cox model with graph-structured selection priors for sparse identification of multi-omics features by making use of a biologically meaningful graph via a Markov random field (MRF) prior to capturing known relationships between multi-omics features. Since the fixed graph in the MRF prior is for the prior probability distribution, it is not a hard constraint to determine variable selection, so the proposed model can verify known information and has the potential to identify new and novel biomarkers for drawing new biological knowledge. Our simulation results show that the proposed Bayesian Cox model with graph-based prior knowledge results in more trustable and stable variable selection and non-inferior survival prediction, compared to methods modeling the covariates independently without any prior knowledge. The results also indicate that the performance of the proposed model is robust to a partially correct graph in the MRF prior, meaning that in a real setting where not all the true network information between covariates is known, the graph can still be useful. The proposed model is applied to the primary invasive breast cancer patients data in The Cancer Genome Atlas project.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous inference for generalized linear models with unmeasured confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07261v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tens of thousands of simultaneous hypothesis tests are routinely performed in genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages. It begins by disentangling marginal and uncorrelated confounding effects to recover the latent coefficients. Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated through lasso-type optimization. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish the identification conditions of various effects and non-asymptotic error bounds. We show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are absent from the model.</description>
