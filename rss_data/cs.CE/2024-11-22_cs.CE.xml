      <title>Sentiment Analysis of Economic Text: A Lexicon-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an Economic Lexicon (EL) specifically designed for textual applications in economics. We construct the dictionary with two important characteristics: 1) to have a wide coverage of terms used in documents discussing economic concepts, and 2) to provide a human-annotated sentiment score in the range [-1,1]. We illustrate the use of the EL in the context of a simple sentiment measure and consider several applications in economics. The comparison to other lexicons shows that the EL is superior due to its wider coverage of domain relevant terms and its more accurate categorization of the word sentiment.</description>

      <title>Approximate Constrained Lumping of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaining insights from realistic dynamical models of biochemical systems can be challenging given their large number of state variables. Model reduction techniques can mitigate this by decreasing complexity by mapping the model onto a lower-dimensional state space. Exact constrained lumping identifies reductions as linear combinations of the original state variables in systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, preserving specific user-defined output variables without error. However, exact reductions can be too stringent in practice, as model parameters are often uncertain or imprecise -- a particularly relevant problem for biochemical systems. We propose approximate constrained lumping. It allows for a relaxation of exactness within a given tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$, while still working in polynomial time. We prove that the accuracy, i.e., the difference between the output variables in the original and reduced model, is in the order of $\varepsilon$. Furthermore, we provide a heuristic algorithm to find the smallest $\varepsilon$ for a given maximum allowable size of the lumped system. Our method is applied to several models from the literature, resulting in coarser aggregations than exact lumping while still capturing the dynamics of the original system accurately.</description>

      <title>A low-rank balanced truncation approach for large-scale RLCk model order reduction based on extended Krylov subspace and a frequency-aware convergence criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model order reduction (MOR) is essential in integrated circuit design, particularly when dealing with large-scale electromagnetic models extracted from complex designs. The numerous passive elements introduced in these models pose significant challenges in the simulation process. MOR methods based on balanced truncation (BT) help address these challenges by producing compact reduced-order models (ROMs) that preserve the original model's input-output port behavior. In this work, we present an extended Krylov subspace-based BT approach with a frequency-aware convergence criterion and efficient implementation techniques for reducing large-scale models. Experimental results indicate that our method generates accurate and compact ROMs while achieving up to x22 smaller ROMs with similar accuracy compared to ANSYS RaptorX ROMs for large-scale benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Spectral Element Methods for Electromagnetic Modeling of Complex Anisotropic Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research thesis presents a novel higher-order spectral element method (SEM) formulated in cylindrical coordinates for analyzing electromagnetic fields in waveguides filled with complex anisotropic media. In this study, we consider a large class of cylindrical waveguides: radially-bounded and radially-unbounded domains; homogeneous and inhomogeneous waveguides; concentric and non-concentric geometries; Hermitian and non-Hermitian anisotropic media tensors. This work explores different wave equation formulations for one-layer eccentric and multilayer cylindrical waveguides. For the first case, we can define a new normalized scalar Helmholtz equation for decoupling TM and TE modes, and for the second, a vectorial Helmholtz equation for hybrid modes in multilayered anisotropic structures. Additionally, we formulate a transformation optics (TO) framework to include non-symmetric and non-Hermitian media tensors for non-concentric multilayer waveguides. Lastly, we model excitation sources for logging sensors applied in geophysical problems using the fields obtained by SEM. We validate the proposed approach against analytical solutions, perturbation-based and mode-matching-based methods, finite-elements, and finite-integration numerical methods. Our technique obtains accurate results with fewer elements and degrees of freedom (DoF) than Cartesian-based SEM and ordinary finite-element approaches. To this end, we use higher-order two-dimensional basis functions associated with the zeros of the completed Lobatto polynomial to model the fields in each reference element. The convergence analysis demonstrates the absence of the Runge effect as the expansion order increases. Numerical results show that our formulation is efficient and accurate for modeling cylindrical waveguided geometries filled with complex media.</description>

      <title>A Dataset for Evaluating Online Anomaly Detection Approaches for Discrete Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</description>

      <title>MStableChain: Towards Multi-Native Stablecoins in EVM-Compatible Blockchain for Stable Fee and Mass Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional blockchain systems, such as Ethereum, typically rely on a \emph{single volatile cryptocurrency for transaction fees}. This leads to fluctuating transaction fee prices and limits the flexibility of users' payment options. To address these issues, we propose MStableChain, which leverage multiple stablecoins as native tokens for transaction fee settlements, thus ensuring stable transaction fees and flexible payment options. To address the challenges of mass adoption and practicality, we propose several core designs. To maintain compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for mass adoption while supporting multiple native stablecoins, MStableChain employs a multi-currency units, multi-type RPCs mechanism. This mechanism enables the system to handle multiple stablecoins without altering the EVM or requiring changes to user applications. Furthermore, an oracle-based gas fee adjustment mechanism is proposed to manage exchange rates between different stablecoins, ensuring equitable transaction costs across various currencies. The system also introduces a secure, on-chain voting-based management protocol for the administrative functions related to these stablecoins. Experimental results from a prototype implementation demonstrate that MStableChain provides stable transaction fee prices, high effectiveness, and good usability.</description>

      <title>Graph convolutional network as a fast statistical emulator for numerical ice sheet modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) provides numerical solutions for ice sheet dynamics using finite element and fine mesh adaption. However, considering ISSM is compatible only with central processing units (CPUs), it has limitations in economizing computational time to explore the linkage between climate forcings and ice dynamics. Although several deep learning emulators using graphic processing units (GPUs) have been proposed to accelerate ice sheet modeling, most of them rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for regular grids. Since they are not appropriate for the irregular meshes of ISSM, we use a graph convolutional network (GCN) to replicate the adapted mesh structures of the ISSM. When applied to transient simulations of the Pine Island Glacier (PIG), Antarctica, the GCN successfully reproduces ice thickness and velocity with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.997, outperforming non-graph models, including fully convolutional network (FCN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Compared to the fixed-resolution approach of the FCN, the flexible-resolution structure of the GCN accurately captures detailed ice dynamics in fast-ice regions. By leveraging 60-100 times faster computational time of the GPU-based GCN emulator, we efficiently examine the impacts of basal melting rates on the ice sheet dynamics in the PIG.</description>

      <title>A TVD neural network closure and application to turbulent combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trained neural networks (NN) have attractive features for closing governing equations. There are many methods that are showing promise, but all can fail in cases when small errors consequentially violate physical reality, such as a solution boundedness condition. A NN formulation is introduced to preclude spurious oscillations that violate solution boundedness or positivity. It is embedded in the discretized equations as a machine learning closure and strictly constrained, inspired by total variation diminishing (TVD) methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. The constraint is exactly enforced during gradient-descent training by rescaling the NN parameters, which maps them onto an explicit feasible set. Demonstrations show that the constrained NN closure model usefully recovers linear and nonlinear hyperbolic phenomena and anti-diffusion while enforcing the non-oscillatory property. Finally, the model is applied to subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling of a turbulent reacting flow, for which it suppresses spurious oscillations in scalar fields that otherwise violate the solution boundedness. It outperforms a simple penalization of oscillations in the loss function.</description>
