      <title>Electrostatic interactions between anisotropic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electrostatic interactions between two charged anisotropic conductors using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods. For widely separated particles, we employ the method of reflections to analyze the interactions. Although the formulation applies to conductors of arbitrary shapes, it is specifically implemented for spheroid-sphere systems to capture anisotropy effects in a simple configuration. In near-contact cases with axisymmetric configurations, the lubrication approximation is used to extend the analysis. Additionally, we develop a Boundary Integral Method (BIM) to study particle interactions at arbitrary separations, validating the results with asymptotic solutions for both near and far fields. We derive analytical expressions for the electrostatic force and torque on a spheroid due to another spheroid in the far-field regime. When combined with hydrodynamic effects, the electrostatic torque competes with the hydrodynamically favourable alignments of a pair of settling spheroids in certain regions while reinforcing them in others. Consequently, the inclusion of electrostatic effects may influence the instability observed in dilute suspensions of spheroids.</description>

      <title>Development and Comparison of Model-Based and Data-Driven Approaches for the Prediction of the Mechanical Properties of Lattice Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice structures have great potential for several application fields ranging from medical and tissue engineering to aeronautical one. Their development is further speeded up by the continuing advances in additive manufacturing technologies that allow to overcome issues typical of standard processes and to propose tailored designs. However, the design of lattice structures is still challenging since their properties are considerably affected by numerous factors. The present paper aims to propose, discuss, and compare various modeling approaches to describe, understand, and predict the correlations between the mechanical properties and the void volume fraction of different types of lattice structures fabricated by fused deposition modeling 3D printing. Particularly, four approaches are proposed: (i) a simplified analytical model; (ii) a semi-empirical model combining analytical equations with experimental correction factors; (iii) an artificial neural network trained on experimental data; (iv) numerical simulations by finite element analyses. The comparison among the various approaches, and with experimental data, allows to identify the performances, advantages, and disadvantages of each approach, thus giving important guidelines for choosing the right design methodology based on the needs and available data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Spreading Under Power Law Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the dynamic spreading of a dense overdamped suspension of particles under power law repulsive potentials, often called Riesz gases. That is, potentials that decay with distance as 1/r^k where k\in (-2,\infty]. Depending on the value of k relative to the system's spatial dimension $D$, the potentials are categorized as short-ranged for k &gt; D, and long-ranged when $k \leq D$. Such systems naturally occur in contexts involving particle suspensions, granular media, and charged systems, where interactions can be influenced by physical fields that decrease over distance. Our analytical findings reveal that the particles spread in a self-similar form, with the radius growing with time as t^1/(k+2). The theoretical predictions derived for a general dimension D, are verified by numerical simulations involving thousands of particles in free space, in both one and two dimensions. Furthermore, the simulations not only confirm our analytical results but also reveal a rich diversity of behaviors depending on the value of k. We demonstrate that the density profiles differ significantly depending on whether k is larger than, smaller than, or equal to D-2, where D is the dimension. For k&gt;D-2 the density is centered in the middle and we also notice a Wigner lattice emerging as a result of the repulsive interactions, for k = D-2, density is uniform and for k&lt;D-2, density is centered at the edges. This new classification indicates that the long/short-range classification is insufficient for predicting the density profile of the suspension. When k&lt;D-2, we observed an interesting phenomenon when two or more suspensions are placed near each other: a particle-free zone is formed where the two populations meet, resembling structures of bubbles.</description>

      <title>Cellular dynamics emerging from turbulent flows steered by active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a continuum theory to describe the collective dynamics of deformable epithelial cells, using two tensor order parameters to distinguish the force-generating active filaments in the cells from their shape. The theory demonstrates how active flows create nematic domains of anisotropic cells, drive active turbulence, and create topological defects. We show that the filament flow-aligning parameter, $\lambda_{\tens{Q}}$, a rheological quantity that determines the response of the filaments to velocity gradients in the active flows, plays a significant, to date unappreciated, role in determining the pattern of extensional and compressional active flows. In a contractile cell layer, local flows are expected to align elongated cells perpendicular to the active filaments. However, with increasing $\lambda_{\tens{Q}}$, long-range correlations in the active turbulent flow field lead to extended regions where this alignment is parallel, as recently observed in experiments on confluent MDCK cell layers. Further, the two order parameter formalism allows us to distinguish defects in the filament director field, which contribute to the active driving, and those in the shape director field, measured in experiments, which are advected by the active flows. By considering the relative orientations of shape and filaments we are able to explain the surprising observation of defects moving towards their heads in contractile cell layers.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Transition to Active Nematic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.</description>

      <title>A strong-coupling effective-field theory for asymmetrically charged plates with counterions only</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in rationalizing the phenomenon of like-charge attraction between charged bodies, such as a pair of colloids, in the strong coupling regime. The two colloids are modelled as uniformly charged parallel plates, neutralized by mobile counterions. In an earlier work [Palaia et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 126, 3143 (2022)], we developed an effective-field theory for symmetric plates, stemming from the ground-state description that holds at infinite couplings. Here, we generalize the approach to the asymmetric case, where the plates bear charges of the same sign, but of different values. In the symmetric situation, the mobile ions, which are localized in the vicinity of the two plates, share equally between both of them. Here, the sharing is non-trivial, depending both on the coupling parameter and the distance between the plates. We thus introduce a counterion occupation parameter, that is determined variationally to ensure minimum of the free energy. The resulting analytical results for the pressure as a function of the plate-plate distance $d$ agree well with our Monte Carlo data, in a large interval of strong and intermediate coupling constants $\Xi$. We show in particular that within this description, there exists a range of large distances at which the attractive pressure features a $1/d^2$ behavior.</description>

Abstract: Many biological and synthetic systems out of equilibrium can be viewed as ratchets that rectify environmental noise through measurements and information processing, like in Maxwell's prototypical demon. These systems pose a challenge to standard approaches because they are better described in terms of decision-making protocols similar to computer programs rather than force laws. Here, we study a many-body generalization of the Maxwell demon problem: a fluid composed of adaptive particles that achieve collective behavior by biasing noise-driven scattering events. Using a combination of information-theoretic, kinetic, and hydrodynamic tools, we elucidate how microscopic decision-making protocols, rather than microscopic forces, generate upon coarse-graining macroscopic non-equilibrium states such as flocking. We find that the signature of such microscopic choices is an 'informational activity' that selectively compresses phase space and causes departures from equilibrium scaling with the magnitude of environmental noise. We envision applications to noise-induced patterning performed by collections of microrobots or programmable phoretic colloids that exploit, rather than fight, fluctuating fields.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced First Order Transition to Collective Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the transition to collective motion in assemblies of aligning self-propelled particles remains a long-standing matter of debate. In this article, we focus on dry active matter and show that weak fluctuations suffice to generically turn second-order mean-field transitions into a `discontinuous' coexistence scenario. Our theory shows how fluctuations induce a density-dependence of the polar-field mass, even when this effect is absent at mean-field level. In turn, this dependency on density triggers a feedback loop between ordering and advection that ultimately leads to an inhomogeneous transition to collective motion and the emergence of inhomogeneous travelling bands. Importantly, we show that such a fluctuation-induced first order transition is present in both metric models, in which particles align with neighbors within a finite distance, and in `topological' ones, in which alignment is based on more complex constructions of neighbor sets. We compute analytically the noise-induced renormalization of the polar-field mass using stochastic calculus, which we further back up by a one-loop field-theoretical analysis. Finally, we confirm our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of fluctuating hydrodynamics as well as of topological particle models with either k-nearest neighbors or Voronoi alignment.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric order in nematic liquids: Flexoelectricity vs electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystalline phases marks a major breakthrough in soft matter research. An intermediate phase, often observed between the nonpolar and the ferroelectric nematic phase, shows a distinct antiferroelectric response to electric fields. However, its structure and formation mechanisms remain debated, with flexoelectric and electrostatics effects proposed as competing mechanisms. By controlling the magnitude of electrostatic forces through ion addition in two representative ferroelectric nematic materials, we show that the primary mechanism for the emergence of antiferroelectric order is the flexoelectric coupling between electric polarization and splay deformation of the nematic director. The addition of ions significantly expands the temperature range over which the antiferroelectric phase is observed, with this range increasing with increasing ion concentration. Polarizing optical microscopy studies and second harmonic generation microscopy reveal the splayed structure modulated in two dimensions, while SHG interferometry confirms its antiferroelectric character. We extend the model previously used to describe pretransitional behaviour by incorporating the electrostatic contribution of ions. The model shows qualitative agreement with the experiments, accurately reproducing the phase diagram and temperature-dependent evolution of the modulation period of the observed structure.</description>

      <title>Local Order Controls the Onset of Oscillations in the Nonreciprocal Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in the nonreciprocal Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying nontrivial spatiotemporal correlations. Long-lived states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium trapped states and a loss of ergodic behavior via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the nonreciprocal Ising model beyond the mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Percolation in semicontinuum geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study percolation problems of overlapping objects where the underlying geometry is such that in D-dimensions, a subset of the directions has a lattice structure, while the remaining directions have a continuum structure. The resulting semicontinuum problem describes the percolation of overlapping shapes in parallel layers or lanes with positional constraints for the placement of the objects along the discrete directions. Several semicontinuum percolation systems are analyzed like hypercuboids with a particular focus on 2D and 3D cases, disks, and parallelograms. Adapting the excluded volume arguments to the semicontinuum setting, we show that for the semicontinuum problem of hypercuboids, for fixed side-lengths of the hypercuboids along the directions in which a lattice structure is maintained, the percolation threshold is always independent of the side-lengths along the continuum directions. The result holds even when there is a distribution for the side-lengths along the continuum directions. Trends in the variation of the thresholds, as we vary the linear measure of the shapes along the continuum directions, are obtained for other semicontinuum models like disks and parallelograms in 2D. The results are compared with those of corresponding continuum and lattice models. For the 2D and 3D models considered, using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the excluded volume predictions for the trends and numerical values of the percolation thresholds. Very good agreement is seen between the predicted numerical values and the simulation results. The semicontinuum setting also allows us to establish a connection between the percolation problem of overlapping shapes in 2D continuum and the triangular lattice. We also verify that the isotropy of the threshold for anisotropic shapes and standard percolation universality class is maintained in the semicontinuum setting.</description>
