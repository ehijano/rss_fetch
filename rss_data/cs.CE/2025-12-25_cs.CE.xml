      <title>Assessing Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction using Angiography-based Data-driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), characterized by impaired regulation of blood flow in the coronary microcirculation, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease and is increasingly recognized as a contributor to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Despite its clinical importance, CMD remains underdiagnosed due to the reliance on invasive procedures such as pressure wire-based measurements of the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), which are costly, time-consuming, and carry procedural risks. To date, no study has sought to quantify CMD indices using data-driven approaches while leveraging the rich information contained in coronary angiograms. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel data-driven framework for inference of CMD indices based on coronary angiography. A physiologically validated multi-physics model was used to generate synthetic datasets for data-driven model training, consisting of CMD indices and computational angiograms with corresponding contrast intensity profiles (CIPs). Two neural network architectures were developed: a single-input-channel encoder-MLP model for IMR prediction and a dual-input-channel encoder-MLP model for CFR prediction, both incorporating epistemic uncertainty estimation to quantify prediction confidence. Results demonstrate that the data-driven models achieve high predictive accuracy when evaluated against physics-based synthetic datasets, and that the uncertainty estimates are positively correlated with prediction errors. Furthermore, the utility of CIPs as informative surrogates for coronary physiology is demonstrated, underscoring the potential of the proposed framework to enable accurate, real-time, image-based CMD assessment using routine angiography without the need for more invasive approaches.</description>

      <title>When Experts Speak:Sequential LLM-Bayesian Learning for Startup Success Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating startups is inherently challenging in entrepreneurial finance, where investors confront severe information asymmetry and limited quantitative data. Leveraging a novel expert network call data, we develop an LLM-Bayesian model that analyzes these conversations at the question-answer turn level, extracting semantic and evaluative signals via large language models (LLMs) and aggregating them in a sequential Bayesian architecture. The model dynamically updates beliefs as additional expert calls occur and attenuates contradictory assessments, which are absent from existing text-based screening tools. Empirically, our model outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by 6.691% in F1-score and increases portfolio-level Return on Investment by 15.255%. Attention and ablation analyses reveal that conversational cues are particularly informative for technologically complex startups, young firms, diverse founding teams, and firms with low public visibility. By converting expert dialogue into continually updated probabilities, our model advances research in entrepreneurial finance and information systems and offers policy implications for improving funding outcomes for informationally disadvantaged startups.</description>

      <title>Quantum Homotopy Algorithm for Solving Nonlinear PDEs and Flow Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A Mechanistic Analysis of Transformers for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>TOMATOES: Topology and Material Optimization for Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) systems are compelling candidates for energy storage, primarily owing to their high storage density. Improving their performance is crucial for developing the next-generation efficient and cost effective devices. Topology optimization (TO) has emerged as a powerful computational tool to design LHTES systems by optimally distributing a high-conductivity material (HCM) and a phase change material (PCM). However, conventional TO typically limits to optimizing the geometry for a fixed, pre-selected materials. This approach does not leverage the large and expanding databases of novel materials. Consequently, the co-design of material and geometry for LHTES remains a challenge and unexplored.
  To address this limitation, we present an automated design framework for the concurrent optimization of material choice and topology. A key challenge is the discrete nature of material selection, which is incompatible with the gradient-based methods used for TO. We overcome this by using a data-driven variational autoencoder (VAE) to project discrete material databases for both the HCM and PCM onto continuous and differentiable latent spaces. These continuous material representations are integrated into an end-to-end differentiable, transient nonlinear finite-element solver that accounts for phase change. We demonstrate this framework on a problem aimed at maximizing the discharged energy within a specified time, subject to cost constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through several illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>BeamformNet: Deep Learning-Based Beamforming Method for DoA Estimation via Implicit Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation has gained increasing popularity. A popular family of DoA estimation algorithms is beamforming methods, which operate by constructing a spatial filter that is applied to array signals. However, these spatial filters obtained by traditional model-driven beamforming algorithms fail under demanding conditions such as coherent sources and a small number of snapshots. In order to obtain a robust spatial filter, this paper proposes BeamformNet-a novel deep learning framework grounded in beamforming principles. Based on the concept of optimal spatial filters, BeamformNet leverages neural networks to approximately obtain the optimal spatial filter via implicit spatial signal focusing and noise suppression, which is then applied to received signals for spatial focusing and noise suppression, thereby enabling accurate DoA estimation. Experimental results on both simulated and real-world speech acoustic source localization data demonstrate that BeamformNet achieves state-of-the-art DoA estimation performance and has better robustness.</description>
