      <title>Graded differential groups, Cartan-Eilenberg systems and conjectures in Conley index theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cartan-Eilenberg systems play an prominent role in the homological algebra of filtered and graded differential groups and (co)chain complexes in particular. We define the concept of Cartan-Eilenberg systems of abelian groups over a poset. Our main result states that a filtered chain isomorphism between free, P-graded differential groups is equivalent to an isomorphism between associated Cartan-Eilenberg systems. An application of this result to the theory of dynamical systems addresses two open conjectures posed by J. Robbin and D. Salamon regarding uniqueness type questions for connection matrices. The main result of this paper also proves that three connection matrix theories in the literature are equivalent in the setting of vector spaces, as well as uniqueness of connection matrices for Morse-Smale gradient systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for optimal homology problems and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiscale simplicial flat norm (MSFN) of a d-cycle is a family of optimal homology problems indexed by a scale parameter {\lambda} &gt;= 0. Each instance (mSFN) optimizes the total weight of a homologous d-cycle and a bounded (d + 1)-chain, with one of the components being scaled by {\lambda}.We propose a min-cost flow formulation for solving instances of mSFN at a given scale {\lambda} in polynomial time in the case of (d + 1)-dimensional simplicial complexes embedded in {R^(d + 1)} and homology over Z. Furthermore, we establish the weak and strong dualities for mSFN, as well as the complementary slackness conditions. Additionally, we prove optimality conditions for directed flow formulations with cohomology over Z+.
  Next, we propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate through 2D examples that the flat norm distance can capture the variations of inputs more accurately than the commonly used Hausdorff distance. As a notion of stability, we also derive upper bounds on the flat norm distance between a simple 1D curve and its perturbed version as a function of the radius of perturbation for a restricted class of perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA. Our approach can be extended to validate synthetic networks created for multiple infrastructures such as transportation, communication, water, and gas networks.</description>

      <title>The Galois-equivariant $K$-theory of finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the $RO(G)$-graded equivariant algebraic $K$-groups of a finite field with an action by its Galois group $G$. Specifically, we show these $K$-groups split as the sum of an explicitly computable term and the well-studied $RO(G)$-graded coefficient groups of the equivariant Eilenberg--MacLane spectrum $H\underline{\mathbb Z}$. Our comparison between the equivariant $K$-theory spectrum and $H\underline{\mathbb Z}$ further shows they share the same Tate spectra and geometric fixed point spectra. In the case where $G$ has prime order, we provide an explicit presentation of the equivariant $K$-groups.</description>

      <title>Symmetric powers of null motivic Euler characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let k be a field of characteristic not 2. We conjecture that if X is a quasi-projective k-variety with trivial motivic Euler characteristic, then Sym$^n$X has trivial motivic Euler characteristic for all n. Conditional on this conjecture, we show that the Grothendieck--Witt ring admits a power structure that is compatible with the motivic Euler characteristic and the power structure on the Grothendieck ring of varieties. We then discuss how these conditional results would imply an enrichment of G\"ottsche's formula for the Euler characteristics of Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <title>Universal covers of non-negatively curved manifolds and formality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if the universal cover of a closed smooth manifold admitting a metric with non-negative Ricci curvature is formal, then the manifold itself is formal. We reprove a result of Fiorenza-Kawai-L\^e-Schwachh\"ofer, that closed orientable manifolds with a non-negative Ricci curvature metric and sufficiently large first Betti number are formal. Our method allows us to remove the orientability hypothesis; we further address some cases of non-closed manifolds.</description>

      <title>Filtration learning in exact multi-parameter persistent homology and classification of time-series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To analyze the topological properties of the given discrete data, one needs to consider a continuous transform called filtration. Persistent homology serves as a tool to track changes of homology in the filtration. The outcome of the topological analysis of data varies depending on the choice of filtration, making the selection of filtration crucial. Filtration learning is an attempt to find an optimal filtration that minimizes the loss function. Exact Multi-parameter Persistent Homology (EMPH) has been recently proposed, particularly for topological time-series analysis, that utilizes the exact formula of rank invariant instead of calculating it. In this paper, we propose a framework for filtration learning of EMPH. We formulate an optimization problem and propose an algorithm for solving the problem. We then apply the proposed algorithm to several classification problems. Particularly, we derive the exact formula of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the filtration parameter, which makes it possible to directly update the filtration without using automatic differentiation, significantly enhancing the learning process.</description>

      <title>Dimension and partial groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A partial group with $n+1$ elements is, when regarded as a symmetric simplicial set, of dimension at most $n$. This dimension is $n$ if and only if the partial group is a group. As a consequence of the first statement, finite partial groups are genuinely finite, despite being seemingly specified by infinitely much data. In particular, finite partial groups have only finitely many im-partial subgroups. We also consider dimension of partial groupoids.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of character stacks via TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of $G$-representation varieties and $G$-character stacks by means of a topological quantum field theory (TQFT). This TQFT is constructed as the composite of a so-called field theory and the 6-functor formalism of sheaves on topological stacks. We apply this framework to compute the cohomology of various $G$-representation varieties and $G$-character stacks of closed surfaces for $G = \text{SU}(2), \text{SO}(3)$ and $\text{U}(2)$. This work can be seen as a categorification of earlier work, in which such a TQFT was constructed on the level of Grothendieck groups to compute the corresponding Euler characteristics.</description>

      <title>Extremal simplicial distributions on cycle scenarios with arbitrary outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cycle scenarios are a significant class of contextuality scenarios, with the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) scenario being a notable example. While binary outcome measurements in these scenarios are well understood, the generalization to arbitrary outcomes remains less explored, except in specific cases. In this work, we employ homotopical methods in the framework of simplicial distributions to characterize all contextual vertices of the non-signaling polytope corresponding to cycle scenarios with arbitrary outcomes. Additionally, our techniques utilize the bundle perspective on contextuality and the decomposition of measurement spaces. This enables us to extend beyond scenarios formed by gluing cycle scenarios and describe contextual extremal simplicial distributions in these generalized contexts.</description>
