      <title>Oral exams in introductory statistics class with non-native English speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oral exams are a powerful tool for educators to gauge student's learning. This is particularly important in introductory statistics classes where many students struggle to grasp a deep meaning of topics like $p$-values, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and more. These challenges are only heightened in a context where students are learning in a second language. In this paper, I share my experience administering oral exams to an introductory statistics class of non-native English speakers at a Japanese university. I explain the context of the university and course that the exam was given in, before sharing details about the two exams. Despite the challenges the students (and I myself) faced, the exams seemed to truly test their statistical knowledge and not merely their English proficiency, as I found little relationship between a student's English ability and performance. I close with encouragements and recommendations for practitioners hoping to implement these exams, all while keeping an eye towards the unique difficulties faced by students not learning in their mother tongue.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Polychoric Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polychoric correlation is often an important building block in the analysis of rating data, particularly for structural equation models. However, the commonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to misspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through violations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that is designed to be robust to partial misspecification of the polychoric model, that is, the model is only misspecified for an unknown fraction of observations, for instance (but not limited to) careless respondents. In contrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type or degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation, is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed, and comes at no additional computational cost. We demonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in simulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration. In the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML differ substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the presence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.</description>
