      <title>Global Convergence of ESPRIT with Preconditioned First-Order Methods for Spike Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike deconvolution is the problem of recovering point sources from their convolution with a known point spread function, playing a fundamental role in many sensing and imaging applications. This paper proposes a novel approach combining ESPRIT with Preconditioned Gradient Descent (PGD) to estimate the amplitudes and locations of the point sources by a non-linear least squares. The preconditioning matrices are adaptively designed to account for variations in the learning process, ensuring a proven super-linear convergence rate. We provide local convergence guarantees for PGD and performance analysis of ESPRIT reconstruction, leading to global convergence guarantees for our method in one-dimensional settings with multiple snapshots, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Numerical simulations corroborate the performance of the proposed approach for spike deconvolution.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Aperture Array Based OAM High-Capacity Communication For Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extensive data interaction demands of an immersive metaverse necessitate the adoption of emerging technologies to enable high-capacity communication. Vortex electromagnetic waves with different orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes are spatially orthogonal, providing a novel spatial multiplexing dimension to achieve high-capacity communication. However, the number of orthogonal OAM modes based on a discrete uniform circular array (UCA) is limited by the number of array elements in the UCA, and traditional discrete channel models are unable to accurately capture the physical properties of vortex electromagnetic wave propagation. The continuous-aperture array (CAPA) is composed of densely packed electromagnetic excitation elements, capable of flexibly and efficiently generating the desired surface currents to produce an arbitrary number of mutually orthogonal OAM modes. From the perspective of electromagnetic information theory (EIT), we propose a CAPA-based OAM orthogonal transmission scheme to realize high-capacity communication. We design the surface currents of the CAPA using Fourier basis functions, derive the electromagnetic channel for vortex electromagnetic waves, and investigate the upper bound of the spectrum efficiency for CAPA-based OAM orthogonal transmission. This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for applying EIT to the orthogonal transmission of vortex electromagnetic waves, offering a novel solution for achieving CAPA-based efficient and high-capacity communication.</description>

      <title>Can TDD Be Employed in LEO SatCom Systems? Challenges and Potential Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-division duplexing (FDD) remains the de facto standard in modern low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems, such as SpaceX's Starlink, OneWeb, and Amazon's Project Kuiper. While time-division duplexing (TDD) is often regarded as superior in today's terrestrial networks, its viability in future LEO SatCom systems remains unclear. This article details how the long propagation delays and high orbital velocities exhibited by LEO SatCom systems impedes the adoption of TDD, due to challenges involving the frame structure and synchronization. We then present potential approaches to overcome these challenges, which vary in terms of resource efficiency and operational/device complexity and thus would likely be application-specific. We conclude by assessing the performance of these proposed approaches, putting into perspective the tradeoff between complexity and performance gains over FDD. Overall, this article aims to motivate future investigation into the prospects of TDD in LEO SatCom systems and solutions to enable such, with the goal of enhancing future systems and unifying them with terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>MovISAC: Coherent Imaging of Moving Targets with Distributed Asynchronous ISAC Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) devices can overcome the traditional resolution limitations imposed by the signal bandwidth, cooperating to produce high-resolution images of the environment. However, existing phase-coherent imaging approaches are not suited to imaging multiple moving targets, since the Doppler effect causes a phase rotation that degrades the image focus and biases the targets' locations. In this paper, we propose MovISAC, the first coherent imaging method for moving targets using distributed asynchronous ISAC devices. Our approach obtains a set of high-resolution images of the environment, in which each image represents only targets moving with a selected velocity. To achieve this, MovISAC performs over-the-air (OTA) synchronization to compensate for timing, frequency, and phase offsets among distributed ISAC devices. Then, to solve the prohibitive complexity of an exhaustive search over the targets' velocities, we introduce a new association algorithm to match the Doppler shifts observed by each ISAC device pair to the corresponding spatial peaks obtained by standard imaging methods. This gives MovISAC the unique capability of pre-compensating the Doppler shift for each target before forming the images, thus recasting it from an undesired impairment to image formation to an additional means for resolving the targets. We perform extensive numerical simulations showing that our approach achieves extremely high resolution, superior robustness to clutter thanks to the additional target separation in the Doppler domain, and obtains cm- and cm/s-level target localization and velocity estimation errors. MovISAC significantly outperforms existing imaging methods that do not compensate for the Doppler shift, demonstrating up to 18 times lower localization error and enabling velocity estimation.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Non-uniform Quantization for Enhanced ILC in Wideband Digital Pre-distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, it is identified that lowering the reference level at the vector signal analyzer can significantly improve the performance of iterative learning control (ILC). We present a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon, where the signals experience logarithmic transform prior to analogue-to-digital conversion, resulting in non-uniform quantization. This process reduces the quantization noise of low-amplitude signals that constitute a substantial portion of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, thereby improving ILC performance. Measurement results show that compared to setting the reference level to the peak amplitude, lowering the reference level achieves 3 dB improvement on error vector magnitude (EVM) and 15 dB improvement on normalized mean square error (NMSE) for 320 MHz WiFi OFDM signals.</description>

      <title>A crayfish-optimized wavelet filter and its application to fault diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial machine fault diagnosis ensures the reliability and functionality of the system, but identifying informative frequency bands in vibration signals can be challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), background noise, and random interferences. The wavelet filter is commonly used for this purpose, but its parameters are crucial for locating the informative frequency band to extract repetitive transients. This study utilizes a crayfish optimization algorithm (COA) to optimize the wavelet filter adaptively for extracting fault characteristics. COA uses correlated kurtosis (CK) as a fitness function while addressing issues related to inaccurate CK period through an updation process. The proposed methodology is applied to different industrial cases and compared with existing methods, demonstrating its superiority in extracting informative frequencies.</description>

      <title>Local damage detection in rolling element bearings based on a Single Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Single Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (SEEMD) is proposed for locating the damage in rolling element bearings. The SEEMD does not require a number of ensembles from the addition or subtraction of noise every time while processing the signals. The SEEMD requires just a single sifting process of a modified raw signal to reduce the computation time significantly. The other advantage of the SEEMD method is its success in dealing with non-Gaussian or non-stationary perturbing signals. In SEEMD, initially, a fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) is added to the raw signal to emphasize on high frequencies of the signal. Then, a convoluted white Gaussian noise is multiplied to the resulting signal which changes the spectral content of the signal which helps in extraction of the weak periodic signal. Finally, the obtained signal is decomposed by using a single sifting process. The proposed methodology is applied to the raw signals obtained from the mining industry. These signals are difficult to analyze since cyclic impulsive components are obscured by noise and other interference. Based on the results, the proposed method can effectively detect the fault where the signal of interest (SOI) has been extracted with good quality.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Converted Measurement Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report derives a generalized, converted measurement Kalman filter for the class of filtering problems with a linear state equation and nonlinear measurement equation, for which a bijective mapping exists between the state and measurement coordinate systems. For these problems, a procedure is developed for mapping the observed measurements and their covariance matrices from measurement coordinates to state coordinates, such that the converted measurements are unbiased and the converted measurement covariance matrices are independent of the states and observed measurements. In cases where not all measurement coordinates are observed, predicted measurements of these coordinates are introduced as substitutes, and the impact of these measurements on the filter is mitigated by an information zeroing operation on the corresponding rows and columns of the converted measurement inverse-covariance matrix. Filter performance is demonstrated on two well-known target-tracking problems and is compared with the performance of the standard extended and unscented Kalman filters for these problems. These examples show the proposed filter obtains lower mean squared error, better consistency, and less track loss than either the extended Kalman filter or the unscented Kalman filter.</description>

      <title>Semantic Learning for Molecular Communication in Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) provides a foundational framework for information transmission in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), where efficiency and reliability are crucial. However, the inherent limitations of molecular channels, such as low transmission rates, noise, and inter-symbol interference (ISI), limit their ability to support complex data transmission. This paper proposes an end-to-end semantic learning framework designed to optimize task-oriented molecular communication, with a focus on biomedical diagnostic tasks under resource-constrained conditions. The proposed framework employs a deep encoder-decoder architecture to efficiently extract, quantize, and decode semantic features, prioritizing task-relevant semantic information to enhance diagnostic classification performance. Additionally, a probabilistic channel network is introduced to approximate molecular propagation dynamics, enabling gradient-based optimization for end-to-end learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic framework improves diagnostic accuracy by at least 25% compared to conventional JPEG compression with LDPC coding methods under resource-constrained communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Power Allocation in OFDM ISAC for Time of Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resource allocation in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems is critical for balancing communication and sensing performance. This paper introduces a novel dynamic power allocation strategy for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC systems, optimizing communication capacity while adhering to Peak Side-lobe Level (PSL) and sensing accuracy constraints, particularly for Time of Arrival (ToA) estimation. Unlike conventional methods that address either PSL or accuracy in isolation, our approach dynamically allocates power to satisfy both constraints. Additionally, it prioritizes communication when sensing performance is insufficient, avoiding any loss in communication capacity. Numerical results validate the importance of considering both sensing constraints and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic power allocation strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Communication and Sensing (ICAS) is a key technology that enables sensing functionalities within the next-generation mobile communication (6G). Joint design and optimization of both functionalities could allow coexistence, therefore it advances toward joint signal processing and using the same hardware platform and common spectrum. Contributing to ICAS sensing, this paper presents the measurement and analysis of the micro-Doppler signature of Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) drones. Measurement is performed with an OFDM-like communication signal and bistatic constellation, which is a typical case in ICAS scenarios. This work shows that micro-Doppler signatures can be used to precisely distinguish flight modes, such as take-off, landing, hovering, transition, and cruising.</description>

      <title>LoRa Fine Synchronization with Two-Pass Time and Frequency Offset Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LoRa is currently one of the most widely used low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies. The physical layer leverages a chirp spread spectrum modulation to achieve long-range communication with low power consumption. Synchronization at long distances is a challenging task as the spread signal can lie multiple orders of magnitude below the thermal noise floor. Multiple research works have proposed synchronization algorithms for LoRa under different hardware impairments. However, the impact of sampling frequency offset (SFO) has mostly either been ignored or tracked only during the data phase, but it often harms synchronization. In this work, we extend existing synchronization algorithms for LoRa to estimate and compensate SFO already in the preamble and show that this early compensation has a critical impact on the estimation of other impairments such as carrier frequency offset and sampling time offset. Therefore it is critical to recover long-range signals.</description>

      <title>Flat-Top Beamforming with Efficient Array-Fed RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-top beam designs are essential for uniform power distribution over a wide angular sector for applications such as 5G/6G networks, satellite communications, radar systems, etc. Low sidelobe levels with steep transitions allow negligible cross sector illumination. Active array designs requiring amplitude taper suffer from poor power amplifier utilization. Phase only designs, e.g., Zadoff-Chu or generalized step chirp polyphase sequence methods, often require large active antenna arrays which in turns increases the hardware complexity and reduces the energy efficiency. In our recently proposed novel array-fed reflective intelligent surface (RIS) architecture, the small ($2 \times 2$) active array has uniform (principal eigenmode) amplitude weighting. We now present a pragmatic flat-top pattern design method for practical array (RIS) sizes, which outperforms current state-of-the-art in terms of design superiority, energy efficiency, and deployment feasibility. This novel design holds promise for advancing sustainable wireless technologies in next-generation communication systems while mitigating the environmental impact of high-energy antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Direction Finding for Software Defined Radios with Switched Uniform Circular Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation is critical for applications in robotics and communication, but high costs and complexity of coherent multi-channel receivers hinder accessibility. This work proposes a cost-effective DoA estimation system for continuous wave (CW) signals in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. A two-channel software-defined radio (SDR) with time-division multiplexing (TDM) enables pseudo-coherent sampling of an eight-element uniform circular array (UCA) with low hardware complexity. A central reference antenna mitigates phase jitter and sampling errors. The system applies an enhanced MUSIC algorithm with spatial smoothing to handle light multipath interference in indoor and outdoor environments. Experiments in an anechoic chamber validate accuracy under ideal conditions, while real-world tests confirm robust performance in multipath-prone scenarios. With 5 Hz DoA updates and post-processing to enhance tracking, the system provides an accessible and reliable solution for DoA estimation in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for PASS: Optimization-Based or Learning-Based?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS)-enabled downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) framework is proposed. PASS consists of multiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous low-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate signals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change both the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the novel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to adaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference mitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both optimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the optimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex complex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then invokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which enables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning dual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Tranformer algorithm is developed, which captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and channel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework significantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve over 30% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a millisecond-level response on modern GPUs.</description>

      <title>Decoding Neuronal Networks: A Reservoir Computing Approach for Predicting Connectivity and Functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03131v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of analyzing electrophysiological measurements in neuronal networks. Our computational model, based on the Reservoir Computing Network (RCN) architecture, deciphers spatio-temporal data obtained from electrophysiological measurements of neuronal cultures. By reconstructing the network structure on a macroscopic scale, we reveal the connectivity between neuronal units. Notably, our model outperforms common methods like Cross-Correlation and Transfer-Entropy in predicting the network's connectivity map. Furthermore, we experimentally validate its ability to forecast network responses to specific inputs, including localized optogenetic stimuli.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Load Forecasting with GAT-LSTM: Leveraging Grid and Temporal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate power load forecasting is essential for the efficient operation and planning of electrical grids, particularly given the increased variability and complexity introduced by renewable energy sources. This paper introduces GAT-LSTM, a hybrid model that combines Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. A key innovation of the model is the incorporation of edge attributes, such as line capacities and efficiencies, into the attention mechanism, enabling it to dynamically capture spatial relationships grounded in grid-specific physical and operational constraints. Additionally, by employing an early fusion of spatial graph embeddings and temporal sequence features, the model effectively learns and predicts complex interactions between spatial dependencies and temporal patterns, providing a realistic representation of the dynamics of power grids. Experimental evaluations on the Brazilian Electricity System dataset demonstrate that the GAT-LSTM model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving reductions of 21. 8% in MAE, 15. 9% in RMSE and 20. 2% in MAPE. These results underscore the robustness and adaptability of the GAT-LSTM model, establishing it as a powerful tool for applications in grid management and energy planning.</description>

      <title>DISC: a Dataset for Integrated Sensing and Communication in mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents DISC, a dataset of millimeter-wave channel impulse response measurements for integrated human activity sensing and communication. This is the first dataset collected with a software-defined radio testbed that transmits 60 GHz IEEE 802-11ay-compliant packets and estimates the channel response including scattered signals off the moving body parts of subjects moving in an indoor environment. The provided data consists of three parts, for more than 2 hours of channel measurements with high temporal resolution (0.27 ms inter-packet time). DISC contains the contribution of 7 subjects performing 5 different activities, and includes data collected from two distinct environments. Unlike available radar-based millimeter-wave sensing datasets, our measurements are collected using uniform packet transmission times and sparse traffic patterns from real Wi-Fi deployments. We develop, train, and release open-source baseline algorithms based on DISC to perform human sensing tasks. Our results demonstrate that DISC can serve as a multi-purpose benchmarking tool for machine learning-based human activity recognition, radio frequency gait analysis, and sparse sensing algorithms for next-generation integrated sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01138v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection and Monitoring using a Data-Driven Information-Based Strategy: Method, Theory, and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to detect when a system undergoes an incipient fault is of paramount importance in preventing a critical failure. Classic methods for fault detection (including model-based and data-driven approaches) rely on thresholding error statistics or simple input-residual dependencies but face difficulties with non-linear or non-Gaussian systems. Behavioral methods (e.g., those relying on digital twins) address these difficulties but still face challenges when faulty data is scarce, decision guarantees are required, or working with already-deployed models is required. In this work, we propose an information-driven fault detection method based on a novel concept drift detector, addressing these challenges. The method is tailored to identifying drifts in input-output relationships of additive noise models (i.e., model drifts) and is based on a distribution-free mutual information (MI) estimator. Our scheme does not require prior faulty examples and can be applied distribution-free over a large class of system models. Our core contributions are twofold. First, we demonstrate the connection between fault detection, model drift detection, and testing independence between two random variables. Second, we prove several theoretical properties of the proposed MI-based fault detection scheme: (i) strong consistency, (ii) exponentially fast detection of the non-faulty case, and (iii) control of both significance levels and power of the test. To conclude, we validate our theory with synthetic data and the benchmark dataset N-CMAPSS of aircraft turbofan engines. These empirical results support the usefulness of our methodology in many practical and realistic settings, and the theoretical results show performance guarantees that other methods cannot offer.</description>

      <title>Interference-Free Backscatter Communications for OFDM-Based Symbiotic Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based scheme to achieve interference-free backscatter communications (BC) in a symbiotic radio system. In specific, we propose three frequency shift keying (FSK) based backscatter modulation schemes to shift the primary signal, i.e., the OFDM symbols transmitted from a base station (BS), in the frequency domain to transmit its information. Symbiotically, the BS empties specific subcarriers within the band so that the received frequency-shifted signals from the backscatter device and the primary signal are always orthogonal. The first scheme relies on the combination of on-off keying (OOK) within the FSK modulation while the second and the third schemes are based on the conventional FSK modulation with different in-band null-subcarrier allocation. These schemes allow the use of non-coherent detection at the receiver which addresses the channel estimation challenge for the signals arriving from a backscatter device. We derive the bit-error rate performance of the detector theoretically. The comprehensive simulations show that the proposed approach achieves a lower bit-error rate up to 10-4 at 30 dB with BC by eliminating direct link interference.</description>

      <title>Joint 9D Receiver Localization and Ephemeris Correction with LEO and $5$G Base Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper leverages Fisher information to examine the interaction between low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and 5G base stations (BSs) in enabling 9D receiver localization and refining LEO ephemeris. First, we propose a channel model that incorporates all relevant links: LEO-receiver, LEO-BS, and BS-receiver.Then, we utilize the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to quantify the information available about the channel parameters in these links. By transforming these FIMs, we derive the FIM for 9D receiver localization parameters-comprising 3D position, 3D orientation, and 3D velocity-along with LEO position and velocity offsets. We present closed-form expressions for the FIM entries corresponding to these localization parameters. Our identifiability analysis based on the FIM reveals that: i) With a single LEO, three BSs, and three time slots are required to estimate the 9D localization parameters and correct the LEO position and velocity. ii) With two LEOs, the same configuration (three BSs and three time slots) suffices for both tasks. iii) With three LEOs, three BSs and four time slots are needed to achieve the same goal. A key insight from the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) analysis is that, under the configuration of one LEO, three BSs, and three time slots, the estimated errors for receiver positioning, velocity, and orientation, as well as LEO position and velocity offsets, are 0.1 cm, 1 mm/s, 0.001 rad, 0.01 m, and 1 m/s, respectively. The receiver localization parameters are estimated after 1 s while the LEO offset parameters are estimated after 20 s. Additionally, our CRLB analysis indicates that operating frequency has minimal impact on receiver orientation estimation accuracy, and the number of receive antennas has a negligible effect on LEO velocity estimation accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The frequency-diverse array (FDA) offers a time-varying beamforming capability without the use of phase shifters. The autoscanning property is achieved by applying a frequency offset between the antennas. This paper analyzes the performance of an FDA joint communication and sensing system with the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The performance of the system is evaluated against the scanning frequency, number of antennas and number of subcarriers. The utilized metrics; integrated sidelobe level (ISL) and error vector magnitude (EVM) allow for straightforward comparison with a standard single-input single-output (SISO) OFDM system.</description>

      <title>Beamforming with Oversampled Time-Modulated Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-modulated array (TMA) is a simple array architecture in which each antenna is connected via a multi-throw switch. The switch acts as a modulator switching state faster than the symbol rate. The phase shifting and beamforming is achieved by a cyclic shift of the periodical modulating signal across antennas. In this paper, the TMA mode of operation is proposed to improve the resolution of a conventional phase shifter. The TMAs are analyzed under constrained switching frequency being a small multiple of the symbol rate. The presented generic signal model gives insight into the magnitude, phase and spacing of the harmonic components generated by the quantized modulating sequence. It is shown that the effective phase-shifting resolution can be improved multiplicatively by the oversampling factor ($O$) at the cost of introducing harmonics. Finally, the array tapering with an oversampled modulating signal is proposed. The oversampling provides $O+1$ uniformly distributed tapering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Absorption-Based, Passive Range Imaging from Hyperspectral Thermal Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Passive hyperspectral longwave infrared measurements are remarkably informative about the surroundings. Remote object material and temperature determine the spectrum of thermal radiance, and range, air temperature, and gas concentrations determine how this spectrum is modified by propagation to the sensor. We introduce a passive range imaging method based on computationally separating these phenomena. Previous methods assume hot and highly emitting objects; ranging is more challenging when objects' temperatures do not deviate greatly from air temperature. Our method jointly estimates range and intrinsic object properties, with explicit consideration of air emission, though reflected light is assumed negligible. Inversion being underdetermined is mitigated by using a parametric model of atmospheric absorption and regularizing for smooth emissivity estimates. To assess where our estimate is likely accurate, we introduce a technique to detect which scene pixels are significantly influenced by reflected downwelling. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the importance of regularization, temperature differentials, and availability of many spectral bands. We apply our method to longwave infrared (8--13 $\mu$m) hyperspectral image data acquired from natural scenes with no active illumination. Range features from 15m to 150m are recovered, with good qualitative match to lidar data for pixels classified as having negligible reflected downwelling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FlexRDZ is an online, autonomous manager for radio dynamic zones (RDZ) that seeks to enable the safe operation of RDZs through real-time control of deployed test transmitters. FlexRDZ leverages Hierarchical Task Networks and digital twin modeling to plan and resolve RDZ violations in near real-time. We prototype FlexRDZ with GTPyhop and the Terrain Integrated Rough Earth Model (TIREM). We deploy and evaluate FlexRDZ within a simulated version of the Salt Lake City POWDER testbed, a potential urban RDZ environment. Our simulations show that FlexRDZ enables up to a 20 dBm reduction in mobile interference and a significant reduction in the total power of leaked transmissions while preserving the overall communication capabilities and uptime of test transmitters. To our knowledge, FlexRDZ is the first autonomous system for RDZ management.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the Sparsity-Diversity Trade-offs in Active Users Detection for mMTC with the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication systems must increasingly support a multitude of machine-type communications (MTC) devices, thus calling for advanced strategies for active user detection (AUD). Recent literature has delved into AUD techniques based on compressed sensing, highlighting the critical role of signal sparsity. This study investigates the relationship between frequency diversity and signal sparsity in the AUD problem. Single-antenna users transmit multiple copies of non-orthogonal pilots across multiple frequency channels and the base station independently performs AUD in each channel using the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. We note that, although frequency diversity may improve the likelihood of successful reception of the signals, it may also damage the channel sparsity level, leading to important trade-offs. We show that a sparser signal significantly benefits AUD, surpassing the advantages brought by frequency diversity in scenarios with limited temporal resources and/or high numbers of receive antennas. Conversely, with longer pilots and fewer receive antennas, investing in frequency diversity becomes more impactful, resulting in a tenfold AUD performance improvement.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on Ziv-Zakai Lower Bounds on the MMSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Bayesian lower bounds on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) that belong to the Ziv-Zakai (ZZ) family. The ZZ technique relies on connecting the bound to an M-ary hypothesis testing problem. Three versions of the ZZ bound (ZZB) exist: the first relies on the so-called valley-filling function (VFF), the second omits the VFF, and the third, i.e., the single-point ZZB (SZZB), uses a single point maximization. The first part of this paper provides the most general version of the bounds. First, it is shown that these bounds hold without any assumption on the distribution of the estimand. Second, the SZZB bound is extended to an M-ary setting and a version of it for the multivariate case is provided. In the second part, general properties of the bounds are provided. First, it is shown that all the bounds tensorize. Second, a complete characterization of the high-noise asymptotic is provided, which is used to argue about the tightness of the bounds. Third, the low-noise asymptotic is provided for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Specifically, in the low-noise, it is shown that the SZZB is not always tight. In the third part, the tightness of the bounds is evaluated. First, it is shown that in the low-noise regime the ZZB bound without the VFF is tight for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Second, for discrete inputs, the ZZB with the VFF is shown to be always sub-optimal, and equal to zero without the VFF. Third, unlike for the ZZB, an example is shown for which the SZZB is tight to the MMSE for discrete inputs. Fourth, sufficient and necessary conditions for the tightness of the bounds are provided. Finally, some examples are shown in which the bounds in the ZZ family outperform other well-known Bayesian bounds, i.e., the Cram\'er-Rao bound and the maximum entropy bound.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Target Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a distributed implementation for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) backed by a massive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) architecture without cells. Distributed multi-antenna access points (APs) simultaneously serve communication users (UEs) and emit probing signals towards multiple specified zones for sensing. The APs can switch between communication and sensing modes, and adjust their transmit power based on the network settings and sensing and communication operations' requirements. By considering local partial zero-forcing and maximum-ratio-transmit precoding at the APs for communication and sensing, respectively, we first derive closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs and the mainlobe-to-average-sidelobe ratio (MASR) of the sensing zones. Then, a joint operation mode selection and power control design problem is formulated to maximize the SE fairness among the UEs, while ensuring specific levels of MASR for sensing zones. The complicated mixed-integer problem is relaxed and solved via successive convex approximation approach. We further propose a low-complexity design, where AP mode selection is designed through a greedy algorithm and then power control is designed based on this chosen mode. Our findings reveal that the proposed scheme can consistently ensure a sensing success rate of $100\%$ for different network setups with a satisfactory fairness among all UEs.</description>

      <title>Regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>

Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to estimate regression coefficients relating environmental variables, such as the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and -- because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs -- errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimates from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we apply prediction-powered inference (PPI) to regression coefficient estimation. PPI generates unbiased estimates by using a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data to correct for bias in large-scale remote sensing map products. Applying PPI across multiple remote sensing use cases in regression coefficient estimation, we find that it results in estimates that are (1) more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and (2) have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Empirically, we observe effective sample size increases of up to 17-fold using PPI compared to only using ground truth data. This is the first work to estimate remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors.

      <title>Characterization of point-source transient events with a rolling-shutter compressed sensing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point-source transient events (PSTEs) - optical events that are both extremely fast and extremely small - pose several challenges to an imaging system. Due to their speed, accurately characterizing such events often requires detectors with very high frame rates. Due to their size, accurately detecting such events requires maintaining coverage over an extended field-of-view, often through the use of imaging focal plane arrays (FPA) with a global shutter readout. Traditional imaging systems that meet these requirements are costly in terms of price, size, weight, power consumption, and data bandwidth, and there is a need for cheaper solutions with adequate temporal and spatial coverage. To address these issues, we develop a novel compressed sensing algorithm adapted to the rolling shutter readout of an imaging system. This approach enables reconstruction of a PSTE signature at the sampling rate of the rolling shutter, offering a 1-2 order of magnitude temporal speedup and a proportional reduction in data bandwidth. We present empirical results demonstrating accurate recovery of PSTEs using measurements that are spatially undersampled by a factor of 25, and our simulations show that, relative to other compressed sensing algorithms, our algorithm is both faster and yields higher quality reconstructions. We also present theoretical results characterizing our algorithm and corroborating simulations. The potential impact of our work includes the development of much faster, cheaper sensor solutions for PSTE detection and characterization.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Low-Complexity Digital Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel low-complexity digital backpropagation (DBP) method, with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between backpropagation accuracy and complexity. The method combines a split step Fourier method (SSFM)-like structure with a simplified logarithmic perturbation method to obtain a high accuracy with a small number of DBP steps. Subband processing and asymmetric steps with optimized splitting ratio are also employed to further reduce the number of steps required to achieve a prescribed performance. The first part of the manuscript is dedicated to the derivation of a simplified logarithmic-perturbation model for the propagation of signal in an optical fiber, which serves for the development of the proposed coupled-band enhanced split step Fourier method (CB-ESSFM) and for the analytical calculation of the model coefficients. Next, the manuscript presents a DSP algorithm for the implementation of DBP based on a discrete-time version of the model and an overlap-and-save processing strategy. Practical approaches for the optimization of the coefficients used in the algorithm and of the splitting ratio of the asymmetric steps are also discussed. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity is presented. Finally, the performance and complexity of the proposed DBP method are investigated through simulations. In a five-channel 100 GHz-spaced wavelength division multiplexing system over a 15x80 km single-mode-fiber link, the proposed CB-ESSFM achieves a gain of about 1dB over simple dispersion compensation with only 15 steps (corresponding to 681 real multiplications per 2D symbol), with an improvement of 0.9 dB over conventional SSFM and almost 0.4dB over our previously proposed ESSFM. Significant gains and improvements are obtained also at lower complexity. A similar analysis is performed also for longer links, confirming the good performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Estimation Of Wave Direction For Unmanned Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have become critical tools for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and autonomous navigation. Accurate estimation of wave direction is essential for improving USV navigation and ensuring operational safety, but traditional methods often suffer from high costs and limited spatial resolution. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict wave direction using sensor data collected from USVs. Experimental results show the capability of the LSTM model to learn temporal dependencies and provide accurate predictions, outperforming simpler baselines.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.</description>
