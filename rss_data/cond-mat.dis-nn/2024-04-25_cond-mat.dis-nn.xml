      <title>Renormalization group of topological scattering networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring and understanding topological phases in systems with strong distributed disorder requires developing fundamentally new approaches to replace traditional tools such as topological band theory. Here, we present a general real-space renormalization group (RG) approach for scattering models, which is capable of dealing with strong distributed disorder without relying on the renormalization of Hamiltonians or wave functions. Such scheme, based on a block-scattering transformation combined with a replica strategy, is applied for a comprehensive study of strongly disordered unitary scattering networks with localized bulk states, uncovering a connection between topological physics and critical behavior. Our RG scheme leads to topological flow diagrams that unveil how the microscopic competition between reflection and non-reciprocity leads to the large-scale emergence of macroscopic scattering attractors, corresponding to trivial and topological insulators. Our findings are confirmed by a scaling analysis of the localization length (LL) and critical exponents, and experimentally validated. The results not only shed light on the fundamental understanding of topological phase transitions and scaling properties in strongly disordered regimes, but also pave the way for practical applications in modern topological condensed-matter and photonics, where disorder may be seen as a useful design degree of freedom, and no longer as a hindrance.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Spherical Spin Glasses in Total Variation via Algorithmic Stochastic Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of algorithmically sampling from the Gibbs measure of a mixed $p$-spin spherical spin glass. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that samples from the Gibbs measure up to vanishing total variation error, for any model whose mixture satisfies $$\xi''(s) &lt; \frac{1}{(1-s)^2}, \qquad \forall s\in [0,1).$$ This includes the pure $p$-spin glasses above a critical temperature that is within an absolute ($p$-independent) constant of the so-called shattering phase transition. Our algorithm follows the algorithmic stochastic localization approach introduced in (Alaoui, Montanari, Sellke, 20022). A key step of this approach is to estimate the mean of a sequence of tilted measures. We produce an improved estimator for this task by identifying a suitable correction to the TAP fixed point selected by approximate message passing (AMP). As a consequence, we improve the algorithm's guarantee over previous work, from normalized Wasserstein to total variation error. In particular, the new algorithm and analysis opens the way to perform inference about one-dimensional projections of the measure.</description>

      <title>Frustrated magnets in the limit of infinite dimensions: dynamics and disorder-free glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the statistical mechanics and the equilibrium dynamics of a system of classical Heisenberg spins with frustrated interactions on a $d$-dimensional simple hypercubic lattice, in the limit of infinite dimensionality $d \to \infty$. In the analysis we consider a class of models in which the matrix of exchange constants is a linear combination of powers of the adjacency matrix. This choice leads to a special property: the Fourier transform of the exchange coupling $J(\mathbf{k})$ presents a $(d-1)$-dimensional surface of degenerate maxima in momentum space. Using the cavity method, we find that the statistical mechanics of the system presents for $d \to \infty$ a paramagnetic solution which remains locally stable at all temperatures down to $T = 0$. To investigate whether the system undergoes a glass transition we study its dynamical properties assuming a purely dissipative Langevin equation, and mapping the system to an effective single-spin problem subject to a colored Gaussian noise. The conditions under which a glass transition occurs are discussed including the possibility of a local anisotropy and a simple type of anisotropic exchange. The general results are applied explicitly to a simple model, equivalent to the isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the $d$-dimensional fcc lattice with first and second nearest-neighbour interactions tuned to the point $J_{1} = 2J_{2}$. In this model, we find a dynamical glass transition at a temperature $T_{\rm g}$ separating a high-temperature liquid phase and a low temperature vitrified phase. At the dynamical transition, the Edwards-Anderson order parameter presents a jump demonstrating a first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Insights from number theory into the critical Kauffman model with connectivity one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kauffman model of genetic computation highlights the importance of criticality at the border of order and chaos. The model with connectivity one is of special interest because it is exactly solvable. But our understanding of its behavior is incomplete, and much of what we do know relies on heuristic arguments. Here, we show that the key quantities in the model are intimately related to aspects of number theory. Using these links, we derive improved bounds for the number of attractors as well as the mean attractor length, which is harder to compute. Our work suggests that number theory is the natural language for deducing many properties of the critical Kauffman model with connectivity one, and opens the door to further insight into this deceptively simple model.</description>

      <title>A model of randomly-coupled Pauli spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model of Pauli spin operators with all-to-all 4-local interactions by replacing Majorana fermions in the SYK model with spin operators. Equivalently, we replace fermions with hard-core bosons. We study this model numerically and compare the properties with those of the SYK model. We observe a striking quantitative coincidence between the spin model and the SYK model, which suggests that this spin model is strongly chaotic and, perhaps, can play some role in holography. We also discuss the path-integral approach with multi-local fields and the possibility of quantum simulations. This model may be an interesting target for quantum simulations because Pauli spins are easier to implement than fermions on qubit-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Amorphous quantum magnets in a two-dimensional Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous solids, i.e., systems which feature well-defined short-range properties but lack long-range order, constitute an important research topic in condensed matter. While their microscopic structure is known to differ from their crystalline counterpart, there are still many open questions concerning the emergent collective behavior in amorphous materials. This is particularly the case in the quantum regime, where the numerical simulations are extremely challenging. In this article, we instead propose to explore amorphous quantum magnets with an analog quantum simulator. To this end, we first present an algorithm to generate amorphous quantum magnets, suitable for Rydberg simulators of the Ising model. Subsequently, we use semiclassical approaches to get a preliminary insight of the physics of the model. In particular, for ferromagnetic interactions, we calculate mean-field phase diagrams, and use the linear-spin-wave theory to study localization properties and dynamical structure factors of the excitations. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we show that amorphous magnets exhibit a complex classical energy landscape by means of simulated annealing. Finally, we outline an experimental proposal based on Rydberg atoms in programmable tweezer arrays, thus opening the road towards the study of amorphous quantum magnets in regimes difficult to simulate classically.</description>
