      <title>Counting $N$ Queens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauss proposed the problem of how to enumerate the number of solutions for placing $N$ queens on an $N\times N$ chess board, so no two queens attack each other. The N-queen problem is a classic problem in combinatorics. We describe a variety of Monte Carlo (MC) methods for counting the number of solutions. In particular, we propose a quantile re-ordering based on the Lorenz curve of a sum that is related to counting the number of solutions. We show his approach leads to an efficient polynomial-time solution. Other MC methods include vertical likelihood Monte Carlo, importance sampling, slice sampling, simulated annealing, energy-level sampling, and nested-sampling. Sampling binary matrices that identify the locations of the queens on the board can be done with a Swendsen-Wang style algorithm. Our Monte Carlo approach counts the number of solutions in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>ROLCH: Regularized Online Learning for Conditional Heteroskedasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts, which yields the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized linear distributional models for conditional heteroskedasticity. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the adaptive estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Estimation of Large Probit Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probit models are useful for modeling correlated discrete responses in many disciplines, including discrete choice data in economics. However, the Gaussian latent variable feature of probit models coupled with identification constraints pose significant computational challenges for its estimation and inference, especially when the dimension of the discrete response variable is large. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating large probit models. Our work is distinct from existing methods in two important aspects. First, instead of simulation or sampling methods, we apply and customize expectation propagation (EP), a deterministic method originally proposed for approximate Bayesian inference, to estimate moments of the truncated multivariate normal (TMVN) in the E (expectation) step. Second, we take advantage of a symmetric identification condition to transform the constrained optimization problem in the M (maximization) step into a one-dimensional problem, which is solved efficiently using Newton's method instead of off-the-shelf solvers. Our method enables the analysis of correlated choice data in the presence of more than 100 alternatives, which is a reasonable size in modern applications, such as online shopping and booking platforms, but has been difficult in practice with probit models. We apply our probit estimation method to study ordering effects in hotel search results on Expedia.com.</description>

      <title>Computational Approaches for Exponential-Family Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a general factor analysis framework where the $n$-by-$p$ data matrix is assumed to follow a general exponential family distribution entry-wise. While this model framework has been proposed before, we here further relax its distributional assumption by using a quasi-likelihood setup. By parameterizing the mean-variance relationship on data entries, we additionally introduce a dispersion parameter and entry-wise weights to model large variations and missing values. The resulting model is thus not only robust to distribution misspecification but also more flexible and able to capture non-Gaussian covariance structures of the data matrix. Our main focus is on efficient computational approaches to perform the factor analysis. Previous modeling frameworks rely on simulated maximum likelihood (SML) to find the factorization solution, but this method was shown to lead to asymptotic bias when the simulated sample size grows slower than the square root of the sample size $n$, eliminating its practical application for data matrices with large $n$. Borrowing from expectation-maximization (EM) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we investigate three estimation procedures based on iterative factorization updates. Our proposed solution does not show asymptotic biases, and scales even better for large matrix factorizations with error $O(1/p)$. To support our findings, we conduct simulation experiments and discuss its application in three case studies.</description>
