      <title>Boundary-Driven Complex Brillouin Zone in Non-Hermitian Electric Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex-valued physical quantities, often non-conserved, represent key phenomena in non-Hermitian systems such as dissipation and localization. Recent advancements in non-Hermitian physics have revealed boundary-condition-sensitive band structures, characterized by a continuous manifold of complex-valued momentum known as the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). However, the ability to actively manipulate the GBZ and its associated topological properties has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a controllable manipulation of the GBZ by adjusting the boundary Hamiltonian and leveraging the boundary sensitivity in a circuit lattice. Our observations reveal that the GBZ forms multiple separated manifolds containing both decaying and growing wave functions, in contrast to the previously observed non-Hermitian skin effect under open boundary condition (OBC). By continuously deforming the GBZ, we observe the topological phase transitions of innate topological structure of GBZ that are enriched by complex properties of non-Hermitian physical variables. Notably, such topological phase transition is governed by boundary conditions rather than bulk properties, underscoring the extreme boundary sensitivity unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for Optimizing Wireless Communications -- Theory and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Controlled Mixed Modulation in Magnetoelectric Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric (ME) magnetic field sensors commonly rely on one of the two modulation principles: the nonlinear dependence of magnetostrictive strain on the applied field or the stress-induced change in magnetization susceptibility. While both effects coexist in any ME device, different readout schemes can be chosen to utilize one or the other effect for magnetic field sensing. This work demonstrates that both principles can be simultaneously implemented in a single electrically modulated ME sensor with inductive readout (a converse ME sensor). This mixed modulation approach significantly enhances low-frequency sensitivity while not affecting the sensitivity at higher frequencies. This leads to a nontrivial dependency of the sensor sensitivity on the frequency of the magnetic field to be measured and can effectively decrease the sensor bandwidth by up to an order of magnitude. We show that the contribution of the modulation from the nonlinearity of the magnetostrictive strain to the sensor sensitivity can be changed by applying a magnetic bias field, offering an additional dimension to the design of ME sensors, especially for potential applications in the unshielded environment.</description>

      <title>Photomolecular Effect as A Potential Explanation for The Cloud Absorption Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud absorption is acknowledged as the biggest source of uncertainty in the climate models. For over 70 years, many experiments have reported clouds absorbing more solar radiation than theory could predict. In the visible spectrum, simulations based on optical constants of water lead to negligible cloud absorption. This result had been explored by some experimentalists to calibrate the cloud absorption measurements. However, the author and his collaborators recently discovered that visible light can directly cleave off water molecular clusters at liquid-air interfaces (PNAS, e2312751120, 2023; e2320844121, 2024), which is named the photomolecular effect in analogy to the photoelectric effect. This discovery suggests that a crucial piece of physics has been missing in the existing theories: light can be absorbed at water-air interface. The photomolecular effect can be simulated by generalizing the boundary conditions for the Maxwell equations using Feibelman parameters that were derived in the past research on the surface photoelectric effect and surface plasmons. In this work, the author uses simulation to show that including the photomolecular effect at the air-water interface can potentially explain the cloud absorption anomaly. Although the lack of accurate Feibelman parameter values prevents a direct comparison of the current theory with experiments, this work points to an unexplored mechanism for explaining the cloud absorption anomaly and calls for further investigation on the impacts of photomolecular effect in the climate modeling.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Emitters in Flux Grown hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an emerging material for use in quantum technologies, hosting bright and stable single photon emitters (SPEs). The B-center is one promising SPE in hBN, due to the near-deterministic creation methods and regular emission wavelength. However, incorporation of B-centers in high-quality crystals remains challenging, typically relying on additional post-growth methods to increase creation efficiency. Here, we have demonstrated controlled carbon doping of hBN during growth, using a metal flux based method to increase the efficiency of B-center creation. Importantly, single B-centers with $g^{(2)}(0) &lt; 0.5$ were able to be generated in the as-grown hBN when carbon additions during growth exceeded 2.5 wt.% C. Resonant excitation measurements revealed linewidths of 3.5 GHz with only moderate spectral diffusion present, demonstrating the applicability of the as-grown hBN as a host for high quality B-centers.</description>

      <title>(111) Facet-engineered SnO2 as Electron Transport Layer for Efficient and Stable Triple-Cation Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the (111) facet-engineered cubic phase SnO2 (C-SnO2) as a novel electron transport layer (ETL) for triple-cation mixed-halide Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The C-SnO2 layer was prepared via a normal sol-gel process followed by the spin-coating technique. The (111) facet C-SnO2 layer provides a larger surface contact area with an adjacent perovskite layer, enhancing charge transfer dynamics at the interface. In addition, the well-matched overlapping band structures improve the charge extraction efficiency between the two layers. Using (111) facet C-SnO2 as ETLs, we obtain PSCs with a higher power conversion efficiency of 20.34% (0.09 cm2) than those employing tetragonal phase SnO2 ETL. The PSCs with C-SnO2 ETL retain over 81% of their initial efficiency even after 480 h. This work concludes with a brief discussion on recombination and charge transport mechanisms, providing ways to optimize C-SnO2 ETL to improve the PSCs' performance and stability.</description>

Abstract: We miniaturized the complex optical system responsible for the cooling, pumping and imaging of an on-chip based cold atom inertial sensor. This optical bench uses bonded miniature optics and includes all the necessary optical functions. The bench has a volume of 35x25x5~cm$^3$. We developed a laser frequency lock adapted to the optical bench using saturated absorption in a rubidium cell. The entire laser source based on frequency doubling of 1.56~$\mu$m fiber lasers, including the control system and the saturated absorption module, fits in a $5U$-rack. Using the miniaturized bench, we realized two and three dimensional magneto optical traps for Rubidium 87 atoms.</description>

      <title>Continual Person Identification using Footstep-Induced Floor Vibrations on Heterogeneous Floor Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Person identification is important for smart buildings to provide personalized services such as health monitoring, activity tracking, and personnel management. However, previous person identification relies on pre-collected data from everyone, which is impractical in many buildings and public facilities in which visitors are typically expected. This calls for a continual person identification system that gradually learns people's identities on the fly. Existing studies use cameras to achieve this goal, but they require direct line-of-sight and also have raised privacy concerns in public. Other modalities such as wearables and pressure mats are limited by the requirement of device-carrying or dense deployment. Thus, prior studies introduced footstep-induced structural vibration sensing, which is non-intrusive and perceived as more privacy-friendly. However, this approach has a significant challenge: the high variability of vibration data due to structural heterogeneity and human gait variations, which makes online person identification algorithms perform poorly. In this paper, we characterize the variability in footstep-induced structural vibration data for accurate online person identification. To achieve this, we quantify and decompose different sources of variability and then design a feature transformation function to reduce the variability within each person's data to make different people's data more separable. We evaluate our approach through field experiments with 20 people. The results show a 70% variability reduction and a 90% accuracy for online person identification.</description>

      <title>Mobility and Threshold Voltage Extraction in Transistors with Gate-Voltage-Dependent Contact Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mobility of emerging (e.g., two-dimensional, oxide, organic) semiconductors is commonly estimated from transistor current-voltage measurements. However, such devices often experience contact gating, i.e., electric fields from the gate modulate the contact resistance during measurements, which can lead conventional extraction techniques to estimate mobility incorrectly even by a factor &gt;2. This error can be minimized by measuring transistors at high gate-source bias, |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, but this regime is often inaccessible in emerging devices that suffer from high contact resistance or early gate dielectric breakdown. Here, we propose a method of extracting mobility in transistors with gate-dependent contact resistance that does not require operation at high |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, enabling accurate mobility extraction even in emerging transistors with strong contact gating. Our approach relies on updating the transfer length method (TLM) and can achieve &lt;10% error even in regimes where conventional techniques overestimate mobility by &gt;2$\times$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic response of topological insulator layer with metamaterial substrate induced by an electric point source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with unique surface conductive properties that distinguish them from normal insulators and have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in electronics and spintronics. However, their weak magnetic field response in traditional setups has limited their practical applications. Here, we show that integrating TIs with active metamaterial substrates can significantly enhance the induced magnetic field by more than $10^4$ times. Our results demonstrate that selecting specific permittivity and permeability values for the active metamaterial substrate optimizes the magnetic field at the interface between the TI layer and the metamaterial, extending it into free space. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods, where the magnetic field decayed rapidly. The findings reveal that the TI-metamaterial approach enhances the magnetic field response, unveiling new aspects of TI electromagnetic behavior and suggesting novel pathways for developing materials with tailored electromagnetic properties. The integration of metamaterials with TIs offers promising opportunities for advancements in materials science and various technological applications. Overall, our study provides a practical and effective approach to exploring the unique magnetic field responses of TIs, potentially benefiting other complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal multipole center for subwavelength acoustic scatterers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multipole expansion is a powerful framework for analyzing how subwavelength-size objects scatter waves in optics or acoustics. The calculation of multipole moments traditionally uses the scatterer's center of mass as the reference point. The theoretical foundation of this heuristic convention remains an open question. Here, we challenge this convention by demonstrating that a different, optimal multipole center can yield superior results. The optimal center is crucial -- it allows us to accurately express the scattering response while retaining a minimum number of multipole moments. Our analytical technique for finding the optimal multipole centers of individual scatterers, both in isolation and within finite arrays, is validated through numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that such an optimized positioning significantly reduces quadrupole contributions, enabling more accurate monopole-dipole approximations in acoustic calculations. Our approach also improves the computational efficiency of the T-matrix method, offering practical benefits for metamaterial design and analysis.</description>

      <title>Critical nonreciprocity in gyrotropic coupled-waveguide system for TE-mode optical isolator and circulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) increasingly require more advanced integrated functionalities and devices to meet the key application challenges. This evolution with the serial integration of optical functions in the same photonic circuit often results in internal reflections and optical feedback, which can specifically destabilize lasers. One solution to overcome this issue is to integrate an optical isolator at the output of the lasers. Among various proposed designs, magneto-optical-based isolators have significantly improved over the past decades in terms of compactness, insertion loss, isolation ratio, and spectral isolation bandwidth. Despite these improvements, the TE optical isolator still lacks in performance. This paper introduces a new operational principle for a TE optical isolator based on modal beating in a transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect (TMOKE) coupled-waveguide system. This approach combines evanescent-coupled silicon waveguides and the magneto-optical effect, resulting in a nonreciprocal propagation that can be optimized for optical isolation. This new concept shows promise in achieving a high-performing TE optical isolator, as it does not depend on resonance and is free from constraints associated with interferometers. Based on data from magneto-optical garnet materials, the simulated device has a length of 500 $\mu$m and its 20 dB-isolation bandwidth is as high as 35 nm. With broadband and high isolation, this simulated device opens possibilities for miniaturizing complex photonic circuits used in optical communication, data communication, and optical sensing.</description>
