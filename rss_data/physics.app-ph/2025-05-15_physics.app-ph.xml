      <title>Enhanced Spin Pumping and Magnetization dynamics in Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/MoS$_2$ stack via interface modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for realizing spin orbit torque (SOT) based magnetic memory devices. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for such appli cations because of their inherently high SOC strength. In this study, we investigate the spin pumping effect at the interface between a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (ML-MoS$_2$) and Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ (Py) thin films using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. FMR measurements reveal a notable enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping factor for the ML-MoS$_2$/Py (Pt = 0 nm) interface compared to the reference Py thin films, attributed to spin pumping across the ML-MoS$_2$/Py interface. To further quantify spin pumping efficiency, we introduce a high SOC platinum (Pt) interlayer at the ML-MoS$_2$/Py interface and systematically vary its thickness. This allows us to evaluate key spin transport parameters, including the enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping parameter, the effective spin mixing conductance that reflects the transfer of spin angular momentum from Py to ML-MoS$_2$ and the effective spin current density.</description>

      <title>Hydraulic performance study of hollow adaptive variable pitch tidal energy turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenges of bidirectional tidal energy utilization efficiency and operational reliability of tidal turbines under low-flow conditions, this paper presents a novel hollow adaptive variable-pitch tidal energy generator based on symmetric airfoil design.In this document, the hydrodynamic performance of the device is analyzed by CFD method, and the energy capture and thrust load characteristics of the turbine are analyzed and discussed. The simulation results show that the power coefficient of the three-bladed turbine is better than that of the four-bladed and five-bladed turbine in the range of 2-4 tip speed ratios at a pitch angle of 10{\deg}, and the optimum power coefficient is 36.8%, which is higher than that of the ordinary axisymmetric wing turbine in terms of its energy acquisition efficiency. Its optimal power coefficient is 36.8%, and its energy efficiency is higher than that of ordinary axial symmetrical wing turbines.</description>

      <title>On Frequency and Angle Stability of Anomalous Metasurface Reflectors Synthesized with Auxiliary Field and Power Conformal Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces (MSs) have recently become an efficient solution for controlling a spatial field distribution according to the demand of an electromagnetic device. In particular, anomalous reflectors based on impenetrable MSs can be realized by introducing a periodic spatial modulation of a local surface impedance defined on a flat or curvilinear surface. Two main methods to derive the profile of a purely reactive impedance that enable perfect anomalous reflection at an arbitrary angle are the power-flow conformal metasurface (PFCM) and auxiliary-field synthesis (AFS) methods. Both methods have been recently implemented with practical MS structures and have been successfully demonstrated in the experiments. However, the two methods assume drastically different synthesis algorithms and result in different impedance profiles. While the PFCM method is based on a direct analytical solution and does not require bounded wave excitation, the AFS method involves non-linear optimization of auxiliary bounded fields (surface waves) with rational selection of proper solutions. From a practical standpoint, the question of which method provides the most frequency-stabile solution becomes important to answer. Here we present a comprehensive analytical and numerical comparison of both methods applied to corrugated impedance surfaces in terms of the co-polarized anomalous reflection efficiency in a wide range of frequencies and corresponding scan angles. It is revealed that even though both methods can achieve imperceptible operational frequency bandwidths difference, the angular coverage of the frequency scan at larger reflection angles is up to 23$\deg$ wider for the PFCM method.</description>

      <title>Multimodal transformers with elemental priors for phase classification of X-ray diffraction spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying a crystalline solid's phase using X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a challenging endeavor, first because this is a poorly constrained problem as there are nearly limitless candidate phases to compare against a given experimental spectrum, and second because experimental signals are confounded by overlapping peaks, preferred orientations, and phase mixtures. To address this challenge, we develop Chem-XRD, a multimodal framework based on vision transformer (ViT) architecture with two defining features: (i) crystallographic data is constrained by elemental priors and (ii) phase is classified according to probabilities (not absolutes). Elemental information can be extracted from pre-synthesis precursors or post-synthesis elemental analysis. By combining structural and elemental modalities, Chem-XRD simultaneously predicts both the number and identity of phases of lead-halide perovskite materials and their decomposition products. Through integrated gradient calculations, we show that the model can adeptly adjust the contributions of structural and elemental modalities toward the final prediction of phase identification, achieving a level of interpretability beyond what self-attention mechanisms can achieve.</description>

      <title>Improving the low-dose performance of aberration correction in single sideband ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single sideband (SSB) framework of analytical electron ptychography can account for the presence of residual geometrical aberrations induced by the probe-forming lens. However, the accuracy of this aberration correction method is highly sensitive to noise, in part due to the necessity of phase unwrapping. In this work, we thus propose two strategies to improve aberration correction performance in low-dose conditions: confining phase unwrapping within the sidebands and selecting only well-unwrapped sidebands for calculating aberration coefficients. These strategies are validated through SSB reconstructions of both simulated and experimental 4D-STEM datasets of monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2). A comparison of results demonstrates significant improvements in Poisson noise tolerance, making aberration correction more robust and reliable for low-dose imaging.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature High-Purity Single Photon Emission from Carbon-Doped Boron Nitride Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an excellent host material for generating room temperature single photons exhibiting high brightness and spin-photon entanglement. However, challenges in improving purity, stability, and scalability limit its use in quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate highly pure and stable single photon emitters (SPEs) in hBN by directly growing carbon-doped, centimeter-scale hBN thin films using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. These SPEs exhibit room temperature operation with polarized emission, achieving a g(2)(0) value of 0.015, which is among the lowest reported for room temperature SPEs and the lowest achieved for hBN SPEs. It also exhibits high brightness ( around 0.5 million counts per second), remarkable stability during continuous operation (&gt; 15 minutes), and a Debye-Waller factor of 45%. First-principles calculations reveal unique carbon defects responsible for these properties, enabled by PLD's low-temperature synthesis and in-situ doping. Our results demonstrate an effective method for large-scale production of high-purity, stable SPEs in hBN, enabling robust quantum optical sources for various applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Modulated Electrical Switching in an Antiferromagnetic Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin version of transistor, where magnetism is used to influence electrical behaviors of the semiconductor, has been a long-pursued device concept in spintronics. In this work, we experimentally study a field-effect transistor with CrSBr, a van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnetic semiconductor, as the channel material. Unlike the weak magnetic tunability of in-plane currents previously reported in vdW magnets, the channel current of our transistor is efficiently tuned by both gate voltage and magnetic transitions, achieving a magnetoresistance ratio as high as 1500%. Combining measurement and theoretical modeling, we reveal magnetically modulated carrier concentration as the origin of the large magnetoresistance. The strategy of using both magnetic ordering and electric field in the same device to control ON/OFF states of a transistor opens a new avenue of energy-efficient spintronics for memory, logic and magnetic sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Spatial Offset of Excited States in Non-Hermitian Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of light-wave packets injected into
  non-Hermitian microcavity lattices under highly dissipative
  conditions. While all eigenstates of the lattice exhibit exponential
  decay, a specifically excited state maintains coherent propagation. In
  a one-dimensional lattice, this state undergoes a spatial
  displacement shift away from the injection position, which is
  a fundamental property of non-Hermitian systems with a point
  gap when the spectrum encircles a finite region in the
  complex plane. Extending such a shift to two-dimensional lattices reveals
  a geometrically anomalous V-shaped wave packet formation with orientation-tunable arms.
  Notably, this geometric control mechanism
  enables all-optical steering of non-Hermitian photonic states without
  requiring structural modifications.</description>

      <title>Harnessing self-sensitized scintillation by supramolecular engineering of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in dense mesoporous template nanospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite-based nanoscintillators, such as CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs), are emerging as promising candidates for ionizing radiation detection, thanks to their high emission efficiency, rapid response, and facile synthesis. However, their nanoscale dimensions - smaller than the mean free path of secondary carriers - and relatively low emitter density per unit volume, limited by their high molecular weight and reabsorption losses, restrict efficient secondary carrier conversion and hamper their practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a strategy to enhance scintillation performance by organizing NCs into densely packed domains within porous SiO2 mesospheres (MSNs). This engineered architecture achieves up to a 40-fold increase in radioluminescence intensity compared to colloidal NCs, driven by improved retention and conversion of secondary charges, as corroborated by electron release measurements. This approach offers a promising pathway toward developing next-generation nanoscintillators with enhanced performance, with potential applications in high-energy physics, medical imaging, and space technologies.</description>

      <title>Natural layered phlogopite dielectric for ultrathin two-dimensional optoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of high-dielectric-constant (high-$\kappa$) materials with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is promising to overcome performance limitations and reach their full theoretical potential. Here we show that naturally occurring phlogopite mica, exfoliated into ultrathin flakes, can serve as a robust high-$\kappa$ dielectric layer for transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D electronics and optoelectronics. Phlogopite's wide bandgap (~4.8 eV), high dielectric constant (~11), and large breakdown field (10 MVcm$^{-1}$) enable transistors with subthreshold swings down to 100 mVdec$^{-1}$, minimal hysteresis (30-60 mV) and interface trap densities comparable to state-of-the-art oxide dielectrics. Moreover, phototransistors built upon monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) and phlogopite exhibit responsivities up to 3.3x10$^{4}$ AW$^{-1}$ and detectivities near 10$^{10}$ Jones, surpassing devices based on conventional gate insulators. We further demonstrate the versatility of this natural dielectric by integrating phlogopite/MoS$_2$ heterostructures into NMOS inverters, showcasing robust voltage gains and low-voltage operation. Our findings establish phlogopite as a promising, earth-abundant dielectric for next-generation 2D transistor technologies and high-performance photodetection.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charge states at the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle in a liquid crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The liquid crystal with suspended ferroelectric nanoparticles is an interesting object for fundamental research of the long-range dipole-dipole interactions; as well as it is promising for optical, optoelectronic and electrochemical applications. Such suspensions can serve as basic elements for advanced nonvolatile memory cells and energy storage devices. The work studies the cells filled with a nematic liquid crystal 5CB and the cells containing 5CB with 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 24 nm. We analyzed the time dependences of the current flowing through the cells at constant applied voltage and the voltage dynamics in the no-load mode. The time dependences of the current and voltage show a slowing down decay rate. For the cells with BaTiO3 nanoparticles, the decrease in the decay time is characteristic. A possible physical reason for the retarding decay time rate is the indirect effect of screening charges, which cover ferroelectric nanoparticles, and slow ionic transport in the liquid crystal. To explain the dynamics of current and voltage, the finite element modeling of the polarization distribution, domain structure dynamics, and charge state of nanoparticles in a liquid crystal is performed using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. Theoretical results confirmed the leading role of screening charges, because the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle adsorbs an ionic-electronic charge that partially screens its spontaneous polarization in single-domain and/or poly-domain states. When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal with nanoparticles, it can release part of the screening charge (mainly due to the change in the polarization of the nanoparticle), which will lead to a decrease in decay time rate of the current and voltage dependences.</description>

      <title>Praseodymium doping effect on the superconducting properties of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ bulks under ambient and high-pressure growth conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A series of Pr-doped FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ (Fe$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Se$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$; $x = 0$ to 0.3) bulks are prepared by conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas pressure and high temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) methods. These bulks are well characterized by structural and microstructural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, transport, and magnetic measurements. The HP-HTS process of the parent bulks has enhanced the onset transition temperature ($T_c^{\rm onset}$) by 1.5 K and the critical current density ($J_c$) by two orders of magnitude compared to the CSP method. Pr-doped FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ up to 10% doping content prepared, either CSP or HP-HTS, slightly increases the unit cell volume, and high-pressure growth produces an almost pure superconducting phase, which confirms the successful Pr-doping at Fe sites. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations suggest the substitution of Pr-atoms in the interlayer spacing of Fe(Se,Te) lattice. High-pressure growth of Fe$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Se$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ also makes the sample less dense compared to the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Transport and magnetic measurements depict that Tconset is almost unaffected by Pr-doping, whereas $J_c$ of Pr-doped FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ is enhanced by one order of magnitude relative to the parent sample developed by CSP but lower than that of the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Hence, Pr-doping at Fe sites preserves $T_c^{\rm onset}$ and improves $J_c$ of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ regardless of the doping contents and growth conditions. These results are promising for the practical application of iron-based superconductors to improve $J_c$ properties without affecting $T_c^{\rm onset}$ through CSP process and congruent with discoveries from other superconductors, like cuprates and MgB$_2$.</description>

      <title>On Overlap Ratio in Defocused Electron Ptychography</title>

Abstract: Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D STEM) with data acquired using a defocused electron probe is a promising tool for characterising complex biological specimens and materials through a phase retrieval process known as Electron Ptychography (EP). The efficacy of 4D STEM acquisition and the resulting quality of EP reconstruction depends on the overlap ratio of adjacent illuminated areas. This paper demonstrates how the overlap ratio impacts the data redundancy and the quality of the EP reconstruction. We define two quantities as a function of the overlap ratio that are independent of both the object and the EP algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluate an EP algorithm for varying overlap ratios using simulated 4D STEM datasets. Notably, a 40% or greater overlap ratio yields stable, high-quality reconstructions.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Trap Design on the Scalability of Trapped-Ion Quantum Technologies</title>

Abstract: To increase the power of a trapped ion quantum information processor, the qubit number, gate speed, and gate fidelity must all increase. All three of these parameters are influenced by the trapping field which in turn depends on the electrode geometry. Here we consider how the electrode geometry affects the radial trapping parameters: trap height, harmonicity, depth, and trap frequency. We introduce a simple multi-wafer geometry comprising a ground plane above a surface trap and compare the performance of this trap to a surface trap and a multi-wafer trap that is a miniaturized version of a linear Paul trap. We compare the voltage and frequency requirements needed to reach a desired radial trap frequency and find that the two multi-wafer trap designs provide significant improvements in expected power dissipation over the surface trap design in large part due to increased harmonicity. Finally, we consider the fabrication requirements and the path towards integration of the necessary optical control. This work provides a basis to optimize future trap designs with scalability in mind.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Characterization of Al/AlxOy/Al Josephson Junctions at Room Temperature</title>

Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at cryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ characterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is essential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature techniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time consuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we show that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements, with proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the JJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial defect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage characteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can be distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by studying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able concept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From these studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields junctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full wafers, with a spread of less then 3$\,$%. The analysis also revealed a variation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a stoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we estimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 - 5000$\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density increased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching process applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to formation of interfacial trap state</description>
