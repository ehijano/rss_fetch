      <title>A Systematic Review of Lagrange Points Applications in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis conducts a systematic review of the applications of Lagrange points within the solar system, utilizing Systems Theory to frame these applications in terms of their interdependencies and potential for integration into broader space mission architectures. By analyzing various applications across domains such as astronomical research, space exploration, space resource utilizations, national defense, and space communication, this study identifies key areas where Lagrange points offer significant advantages. The research employs a qualitative analysis of existing literature combined with theoretical modeling to demonstrate how these points can be optimally utilized in future space missions. The finding suggests that a Systems Theory approach not only clarifies the roles and benefits of Lagrange points in space mission design but also reveals new pathways for enhancing mission efficiency and effectiveness. This thesis underscores the importance of a holistic view in the strategic planning of space missions and provides a foundational approach for integrating Lagrange points into future exploratory and operational frameworks.</description>

      <title>The Photochemical Plausibility of Warm Exo-Titans Orbiting M-Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun to spectrally characterize small exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf stars, but interpretation of these spectra is ambiguous, with stellar, instrumental, or atmospheric origins possible for apparent spectral features. Consequently, interpretation of JWST small exoplanet spectra follows a Bayesian approach, with less theoretically plausible interpretations facing a higher burden of proof. Here, we use photochemical modeling to evaluate the plausibility of warm exo-Titans, exoplanets with N$_2$-CH$_4$ atmospheres analogous to Titan but orbiting closer to their host stars. Consideration of warm exo-Titans is motivated by arguments from planet formation, as well as tentative evidence from observations. Using TRAPPIST-1e as a case study, we show that the higher instellation experienced by warm exo-Titans reduces their CH$_4$ lifetime $\tau_{\text{CH}_{4}}$ relative to true Titan by orders of magnitude, reducing the probability of observing them. We constrain the $\tau_{\text{CH}_{4}}$ on a warm exo-Titan to be $\leq0.1\times$ (and most likely $\leq0.02\times$) true Titan, implying the absolute probability of detecting a warm exo-Titan is $&lt;0.1$ and likely $&lt;0.01$. This finding is consistent with recent JWST nondetections of CH$_4$-dominated atmospheres on warm terrestrial exoplanets. The low prior probability means that the standard of proof required to claim a warm exo-Titan detection is high, and we offer specific suggestions towards such a standard of proof. Observation of oxidized carbon species would corroborate a putative warm exo-Titan detection. Confirmed detection of warm exo-Titans would signal the need to fundamentally rethink our understanding of the structure, dynamics, and photochemistry of Titan-like worlds.</description>

      <title>LEO-Vetter: Fully Automated Flux- and Pixel-Level Vetting of TESS Planet Candidates to Support Occurrence Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified several thousand planet candidates orbiting a wide variety of stars, and has provided an exciting opportunity for demographic studies. However, current TESS planet searches require significant manual inspection efforts to identify planets among the enormous number of detected transit-like signatures, which limits the scope of such searches. Demographic studies also require a detailed understanding of the relationship between observed and true exoplanet populations; a task for which current TESS planet catalogs are rendered unsuitable by the subjectivity of vetting by eye. We present LEO-Vetter, a publicly available and fully automated exoplanet vetting system designed after the Kepler Robovetter, which is capable of efficiently producing catalogs of promising planet candidates and making statistically robust TESS demographic studies possible. LEO-Vetter implements flux- and pixel-level tests against noise/systematic false positives and astrophysical false positives. The vetter achieves high completeness (91%) and high reliability against noise/systematic false alarms (97%) based on its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the vetter by searching ~200,000 M dwarf light curves, and reducing ~20,000 transit-like detections down to 172 uniformly vetted planet candidates. LEO-Vetter facilitates analyses that would otherwise be impractical to perform on all possible signals due to time constraints or computational limitations. Users will be able to efficiently produce their own TESS planet catalog starting with transit-like detections, as well as have the framework needed to characterize their catalog's completeness and reliability for occurrence rates.</description>

      <title>New constraint on Europa's ice shell: magnetic signature from the ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter's icy moons are believed to host subsurface liquid oceans, and among them, Europa stands out as one of the most promising candidates for extraterrestrial life. Yet, the processes driving oceanic flows beneath its ice shell, as well as the factors controlling the thickness of this ice, remain incompletely understood. One especially distinctive feature of Europa is that its salty ocean is electrically conducting and thus influenced by Jupiter's time-varying magnetic field, which is believed to drive a large-scale zonal flow. Here, we examine hos this magnetically-induced jet affects both the heat flux and the dynamics of the convective flow within Europa's ocean. We first show that the magnetically-driven jet efficiently transports heat in stably stratified regions near the top of the ocean, and may alter the expected convective scaling laws in deeper layers. Second, by analysing the latitudinal distribution of heat flux and relating it to ice-thickness variations, we make predictions that can be compared with current observations. In anticipation of the upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper missions, we discuss how improved measurement precision could help further constrain the ocean's properties and refine our model-based forecasts.</description>

      <title>Hydrocarbon Hazes on Temperate sub-Neptune K2-18b supported by data from the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K2-18b, a sub-Neptune orbiting in the habitable zone of an M dwarf, has attracted significant interest following observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and, more recently, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveal detectable atmospheric features. Previous studies have examined a wide range of possible compositions, focusing primarily in the near-infrared (0.8-5.2 $\mu$m) or mid-infrared (5-12 $\mu$m) wavelengths. We present a new interpretation of K2-18b's JWST transit spectra, combining an independent reduction of MIRI LRS data with previously published NIRISS/NIRSpec observations. We assess the impact of stellar parameter uncertainties on the inferred planetary properties and, using revised stellar parameters, derive a planetary density of $\rho_P = 3.34 \pm 1.44$ g cm$^{-3}$. We consider scattering and absorption from laboratory-produced haze analogues and perform free-chemistry Bayesian retrievals informed by equilibrium chemistry. Our results are consistent with an H$_2$-dominated mini-Neptune atmosphere with a mean molecular weight of $\mu \sim$2.4 Daltons, and support the presence of hydrocarbon hazes across 0.85-12 $\mu$m without requiring instrumental offsets. Our retrieved CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ abundances are broadly consistent between models but systematically lower than in haze-free studies, suggesting that haze reduces the need for high-$\mu$ solutions. While our retrievals tend to favour atmospheric temperatures $\sim$100-200 K warmer than previously reported, cooler solutions ($\sim$250 K) remain viable if the planetary mass is reduced towards the lower end of its uncertainty. We emphasise the need for follow-up self-consistent photochemical and microphysical modelling, alongside further mid-infrared observations to constrain key hydrocarbon species.</description>

      <title>Consistent Modeling of Non-equilibrium Dust Sublimation and the Interactions with Dust Evolution in the Inner Regions of Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are host to the sublimation of dust grains, a process traditionally modeled using equilibrium thermodynamics. We demonstrate through ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations that silicate dust sublimation is inherently a non-equilibrium kinetic process. The binding energies and vibrational frequencies governing desorption, calculated for MgSiO3 and other compositions, reveal that sublimation timescales far exceed local dynamical times, allowing grains to persist in a superheated state. This kinetic inhibition results in a broad, dynamic sublimation front whose location and morphology are strongly regulated by radial advection and dust coagulation. Our coupled simulations, integrating sublimation with advection and grain evolution, show that the front varies radially by a factor of four with accretion rate and exhibits a vertically stratified, bowl-shaped structure. These findings imply that the inner disk dust distribution, thermal structure, and subsequent planet formation are profoundly influenced by the kinematics and kinetics of dust grains, necessitating a departure from equilibrium prescriptions in disk models and interpretations of inner rim observations.</description>

      <title>Origin of the lunar farside highlands from Earthshine-induced global circulation in lunar magma ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lunar farside highlands, referred to as the lunar farside thicker crust compared with the nearside crust, presents a challenge to the theory of formation and evolution of the Moon. Here, we show that, after the Moon reached synchronous rotation, Earthshine could induce global circulation in lunar magma ocean due to the imposed surface temperature gradient generated by the hot, post-giant impact Earth. The global circulation, generating downwellings on the farside and a deeper return flow on the nearside, results that magmas flow from the nearside to the farside in the shallow magma ocean while the the direction of flow is opposite in the deep magma ocean. Such flow in the shallow magma ocean would transport anorthositic crystals formed in the nearside to the farside. Furthermore, since the lunar farside is cooler than the nearside, crystallization is much more efficient at the farside, resulting that farside magmas transported from the nearside produce anorthositic crystals rapidly. The theory proposed here may provide a natural way of explaining the origin of the lunar farside highlands.</description>

      <title>The Polar Orbit of TOI-2374 b, a Planet in the Neptunian Ridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``Neptunian ridge'' is a recently identified peak in the frequency of planets with sizes between that of Neptune and Saturn orbiting their host stars with periods between 3 and 6 days (A. Castro-Gonz\'alez et al. 2024). These planets may have formed similarly to their larger, hot Jupiter counterparts in the ``three-day pile-up'', through a dynamically excited migration pathway. The distribution of stellar obliquities in hot Neptune systems may therefore provide a vital clue as to their origin. We report a new stellar obliquity measurement for TOI-2374\,b, a planet in the Neptunian ridge ($P = 4.31$ days, $R_p = 7.5 R_\oplus$). We observed a spectroscopic transit of TOI-2374 b with the Keck Planet Finder, detecting the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) anomaly with an amplitude of 3 m/s, and measured a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda = {81^\circ}^{+23^\circ}_{-22^\circ}$, indicating an orbit significantly misaligned with the spin axis of its host star. A reloaded RM analysis of the cross-correlation functions confirms this misalignment, measuring $\lambda = {65^\circ}^{+32^\circ}_{-24^\circ}$. Additionally, we measured a stellar rotation period of $P_\mathrm{rot} = 26.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ days with photometry from the Tierras observatory, allowing us to deduce the three-dimensional stellar obliquity of $\psi = {85.9^\circ}^{+8.6^\circ}_{-9.2^\circ}$. TOI-2374 b joins a growing number of hot Neptunes on polar orbits. The high frequency of misaligned orbits for Neptunian ridge and desert planets, compared with their longer period counterparts, is reminiscent of patterns seen for the giant planets and may suggest a similar formation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Points and Surface Dynamics About Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small bodies in our Solar System are considered remnants of their early formation. Studying their physical and dynamic properties can provide insights into their evolution, stability, and origin. ESA's Rosetta mission successfully landed and studied comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) for approximately two years. In this work, the aim is to analyze the surface and orbital dynamics of comet 67P in detail, using a suitable 3-D polyhedral shape model. We applied the polyhedron method to calculate dynamic surface characteristics, including geometric height, surface tilt, surface slopes, geopotential surface, acceleration surface, escape speed, equilibrium points, and zero-velocity curves. The results show that the gravitational potential is predominant on the comet's surface due to its slow rotation. The escape speed has the maximum value in the Hapi region (the comet's neck). The surface slopes were analyzed to predict possible regions of particle motion and accumulation. The results show that most regions of the comet's surface have low slopes. Furthermore, we analyzed the slopes under the effects of Third-Body gravitational and Solar Radiation Pressure perturbations. Our results showed that the effects of Third-Body perturbations do not significantly affect the global behavior of slopes. Meanwhile, the Solar Radiation Pressure does not significantly affect particles across the surface of comet 67P with sizes $&gt;\sim10^{-3}$\,cm at apocenter and $&gt;\sim10^{-1}$\,cm at pericenter. We also identified four equilibrium points around comet 67P and one equilibrium point inside the body, where points E$_2$ and E$_5$ are linearly stable. In addition, we approximated the shape of comet 67P using the simplified Dipole Segment Model to study its dynamics, employing parameters derived from its 3-D polyhedral shape model. We found 12 families of planar symmetric periodic orbits around the body.</description>

      <title>Disentangling disc and atmospheric signatures of young brown dwarfs with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young brown dwarfs serve as analogues of giant planets and provide benchmarks for atmospheric and formation models. JWST has enabled access to near-infrared spectra of brown dwarfs with unprecedented sensitivity. We aim to constrain their chemical compositions, temperature structures, isotopic ratios, and disc emission. We perform retrievals and disc modelling on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution ($R \approx 2700$) spectra spanning 0.97--5.27 $\mu$m, combining radiative transfer, line-by-line opacities, parameterised temperature profiles, and flexible equilibrium chemistry. We include a disc ring with blackbody continuum and optically thin CO emission. We detect over twenty species, including $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, SiO, and hydrides. The CO band at 4.6 $\mu$m reveals $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O. Carbon isotope ratios are $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $79^{+14}_{-11}$ (TWA 27A) and $75^{+2}_{-2}$ (TWA 28); oxygen ratios are $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = $645^{+80}_{-70}$ and $681^{+53}_{-50}$. Both objects show excess infrared emission, consistent with warm ($\approx 650$ K) blackbody rings, and optically thin CO from hot gas ($\geq 1600$ K) needed to match the red spectra. The atmospheric C/O ratios are $0.54 \pm 0.02$ (TWA 27A) and $0.59 \pm 0.02$ (TWA 28), consistent with solar values. We characterise the atmospheres and discs of two young brown dwarfs through joint constraints on temperature, composition, isotopes, and discs, demonstrating JWST/NIRSpec's ability to probe young objects and circumplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Dust trapping in protoplanetary discs after stellar flybys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flybys are likely to be common in young star-forming regions and could be responsible for substructures observed in protoplanetary discs. Using three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, we study dust trapping in discs perturbed by parabolic coplanar flybys. We find that spiral structures are induced in the gas and dust discs for both prograde and retrograde encounters. By tracking individual dust particles within the flyby-induced substructures, we determine that they have a highly enhanced dust to gas ratio compared to particles in an unperturbed disc. We further find that the local dust to gas ratios in flyby-induced substructures are sufficiently high to trigger the streaming instability and hence facilitate planetesimal formation in young discs.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a gap in the envelope mass fraction of sub-Saturns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the core-accretion model, gas giants form via runaway accretion. This process starts when the mass of the accreted envelope becomes equal to the mass of the core. Here, we model a population of warm sub-Saturns to search for imprints of their formation history in their internal structure. Using the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), we calculate a grid of interior structure models on which we perform retrievals for our sample of 28 sub-Saturns to derive their envelope mass fractions ($f_{env}$). For each planet, we run three different retrievals assuming low (-2.0 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 0.5), medium ( 0.5 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 1.4), and high (1.4 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 1.7) atmospheric metallicity. The distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample is then compared to predictions of planet formation models. When compared to the outcomes of a planetesimal accretion model, we find that we require medium to high atmospheric metallicities to reproduce the simulated planet population. Additionally, we find a bimodal distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample with a gap that is located at different values of $f_{env}$ for different atmospheric metallicities. For the high atmospheric metallicity case, the gap in the $f_{env}$ distribution is located between 0.5 and 0.7, which is consistent with assumptions by the core-accretion model where runaway accretion starts when $M_{env} \approx M_{core}$ ($f_{env} \sim 0.5$). We also find a bimodal distribution of the hydrogen and helium mass fraction ($f_{H/He}$) with a gap at $f_{H/He} = 0.3$. The location of this gap is independent of the assumed atmospheric metallicity. Lastly, we compare the distributions of our sub-Saturns in the Neptunian savanna to a population of sub-Saturns in the Neptune desert and ridge. We find that the observed $f_{env}$ distribution of savanna and ridge sub-Saturns is consistent with the planets coming from the same underlying population.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Dust Evolution and Vertical Transport in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial is an introduction to observational studies of dust transport and evolution in protoplanetary disks. Spatially resolved observations of disks at multiple wavelengths can allow to infer the distribution of various dust grains and gas species. Combining these observations offers a more complete understanding of dust structure and properties across different disk locations. For example, by better characterizing the disk vertical structure, observations help to constrain the level of vertical settling and identify regions of high dust density, which are favorable for grain growth and planet formation. This tutorial describes various methodologies for inferring dust properties and vertical height of different tracers, as an introduction for beginners.</description>

      <title>Space Astrometry with Gaia: Advances in Understanding our Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia is a satellite mission of the European Space Agency which is creating a catalogue of extremely accurate positions, distances and space motions of two billion stars in our Galaxy, along with more than one hundred thousand solar system asteroids, and several million distant quasars, all on the same extragalactic reference system. Complementary information on each object's multi-epoch photometry and spectra provides a vast and unprecedented data base of (model-dependent) fundamental physical quantities, such as each star's mass, age, and chemical composition. I outline the field's historical context, and explain the key principles involved in these space measurements. This is followed by a broad review of the many areas of solar system science, stellar structure and evolution, and topics in Galactic structure, evolution, and dynamics, that are being derived from these data.</description>

      <title>Understanding variations of galactic energetic particles in the heliosphere: modelling and radiation hazard assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intensity and energy spectrum of energetic charged radiation in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by solar activity. This phenomenon is known as solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays.
  As interplanetary travel becomes a reality, missions in low Earth orbit become longer and more frequent. In low Earth orbit we need to estimate the influence of Earth's magnetosphere accurately to assess the radiation hazard experienced by astronauts during space missions, there is an emergent need for accurately depicting the space radiation environment and predicting the cosmic-ray flux in the heliosphere.
  Here we present a new effective and predictive model of solar modulation which incorporates fundamental physics processes of particle transport such as diffusion, convection, and adiabatic cooling to compute the energy spectrum; and temporal evolution of cosmic radiation in the inner heliosphere.
  Empowered by this model and a time-dependent effective description of the geomagnetic field, we will show our estimates of the dose rates experienced by astronauts over time, as they orbit Earth onboard the International Space Station and while travelling through interplanetary space.</description>

      <title>Stellar Obliquity Excitation via Disk Dispersal-Driven Resonances in Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stellar obliquity of a planetary system is often used to help constrain the system's formation and evolution. One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant ($\sim 300\;\mathrm{AU}$) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the $\sim 50\%$ binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between $60^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ for most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at $\sim 2\;\mathrm{AU}$, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Massive Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Long-term Evolution and Leaking Rates of Neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 Mean Motion Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current populations trapped in Neptune's main mean motion resonances in the Kuiper belt, Plutinos in the 3:2 and Twotinos in the 2:1, contain some of the best-characterized minor objects in the Solar System, given their dynamical importance. In particular, Twotinos may hide evidence of Neptune's early migration. However, these populations vary in time, declining at a rate that has not been previously clearly established. In this work, we use numerical simulations to study the long-term evolution of the Plutino and Twotino populations. We use two data sources: the most up-to-date observations and the theoretical debiased model of the Kuiper belt known as L7. In addition to studying the giant planets' effect on these populations over 4 Gyr, we analyze the additional impact produced by the ten most massive trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) trapped in these resonances, as well as the effect of Pluto on the 2:1 population. We find that the decay rate in each resonance can be modeled as a stochastic process well described by an exponential decay with an offset determined by an underlying long-term stable population. The most massive TNOs, particularly Pluto, influence this decay rate significantly, as expected for the 3:2 resonance. Remarkably, Pluto also strongly influences the 2:1 resonance's evolution.</description>

      <title>The vertical structure of debris discs and the role of disc gravity: A primer using a simplified model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Debris discs provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. Their structures are commonly attributed to planetary perturbations, serving as probes of as-yet-undetected planets. However, most studies of planet-debris disc interactions ignore the disc's gravity, treating it as a collection of massless planetesimals. Here, using an analytical model, we investigate how the vertical structure of a back-reacting debris disc responds to secular perturbations from an inner, inclined planet. Considering the disc's axisymmetric potential, we identify two dynamical regimes: planet-dominated and disc-dominated, which may coexist, separated by a secular-inclination resonance. In the planet-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\ll1$), we recover the classical result: a transient warp propagates outward until the disc settles into a box-like structure centered around the planetary orbit's initial inclination $I_p(0)$, with a distance-independent aspect ratio $\mathcal{H}(R)\approx I_p(0)$. In contrast, in the disc-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\gtrsim1$), the disc exhibits dynamical rigidity, remaining thin and misaligned, with significantly suppressed inclinations and a sharply declining aspect ratio, $\mathcal{H}(R)\propto I_p(0)R^{-7/2}$. In the intermediate regime ($M_d/m_p\lesssim1$), the system exhibits a secular-inclination resonance, leading to long-lived, warp-like structures and a bimodal inclination distribution, containing both dynamically hot and cold populations. We provide analytic formulae describing these effects as a function of system parameters. We also find that the vertical density profile is intrinsically non-Gaussian and recommend fitting observations with non-zero slopes of $\mathcal{H}(R)$. Our results may be used to infer planetary parameters and debris disc masses based on observed warps and scale heights, as demonstrated for HD 110058 and $\beta$ Pic.</description>

      <title>The star HIP 41378 potentially misaligned with its cohort of long-period planets</title>

Abstract: The obliquity between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit, detected via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, is a tracer of the formation history of planetary systems. While obliquity measurements have been extensively applied to hot Jupiters and short-period planets, they remain rare for cold and long-period planets due to observational challenges, particularly their long transit durations. We report the detection of the RM effect for the 19-hour-long transit of HIP 41378 f, a temperate giant planet on a 542-day orbit, observed through a worldwide spectroscopic campaign. We measure a slight projected obliquity of 21 $\pm$ 8 degrees and a significant 3D spin-orbit angle of 52 $\pm$ 6 degrees, based on the measurement of the stellar rotation period. HIP 41378 f is part of a 5-transiting planetary system with planets close to mean motion resonances. The observed misalignment likely reflects a primordial tilt of the stellar spin axis relative to the protoplanetary disk, rather than dynamical interactions. HIP 41378 f is the first non-eccentric long-period (P&gt;100 days) planet observed with the RM effect, opening new constraints on planetary formation theories. This observation should motivate the exploration of planetary obliquities across a longer range of orbital distances through international collaboration.</description>

      <title>A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</description>
