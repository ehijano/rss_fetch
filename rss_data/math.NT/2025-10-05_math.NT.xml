      <title>On the pro-\'etale cohomology of quotient stacks of Drinfeld spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}$ denote the $(n-1)$-dimensional Drinfeld space over a $p$-adic field $K$. We give an explicit description of the $\ell$-adic and $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of quotient stacks $[\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}/\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathcal{O}_K)]$ and $[\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}/\operatorname{GL}_n(K)]$, which are moduli stacks of special formal $\mathcal{O}_D$-modules. The computation makes use of the isomorphism between the Lubin-Tate tower and the Drinfeld tower due to Faltings and Scholze--Weinstein, as well as the $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of the Drinfeld spaces computed by Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol. As an application, we also compute the continuous group cohomology of $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ over duals of generalized Steinberg representations over $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</description>

      <title>Local newforms for generic representations of $p$-adic ${\rm SO}_{2n+1}$: Uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjectural theory of local newofmrs for the split $p$-adic group ${\rm SO}_{2n+1}$, proposed by Gross, predicts that the space of local newforms in a generic representation is one-dimensional. In this note, we prove that this space is at most one-dimensional and verify its expected arithmetic properties, conditional on existence. These results play an important role in our proof of the existence part of the newform conjecture.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping as a Morphism: An Arithmetic Geometry Approach to Asymptotically Faster Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a powerful paradigm for secure computation, but its practical adoption is severely hindered by the prohibitive computational cost of its bootstrapping procedure. The complexity of all current bootstrapping methods is fundamentally tied to the multiplicative depth of the decryption circuit, denoted $L_{dec}$, making it the primary performance bottleneck. This paper introduces a new approach to bootstrapping that completely bypasses the traditional circuit evaluation model. We apply the tools of modern arithmetic geometry to reframe the bootstrapping operation as a direct geometric projection. Our framework models the space of ciphertexts as an affine scheme and rigorously defines the loci of decryptable and fresh ciphertexts as distinct closed subschemes. The bootstrapping transformation is then realized as a morphism between these two spaces. Computationally, this projection is equivalent to solving a specific Closest Vector Problem (CVP) instance on a highly structured ideal lattice, which we show can be done efficiently using a technique we call algebraic folding. The primary result of our work is a complete and provably correct bootstrapping algorithm with a computational complexity of $O(d \cdot \text{poly}(\log q))$, where $d$ is the ring dimension and $q$ is the ciphertext modulus. The significance of this result lies in the complete elimination of the factor $L_{dec}$ from the complexity, representing a fundamental asymptotic improvement over the state of the art. This geometric perspective offers a new and promising pathway toward achieving truly practical and high-performance FHE.</description>

      <title>Selmer-Inspired Elliptic Curve Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is foundational to modern secure communication, yet existing standard curves have faced scrutiny for opaque parameter-generation practices. This work introduces a Selmer-inspired framework for constructing elliptic curves that is both transparent and auditable. Drawing from $2$- and $3$-descent methods, we derive binary quartics and ternary cubics whose classical invariants deterministically yield candidate $(c_4,c_6)$ parameters. Local solubility checks, modeled on Selmer admissibility, filter candidates prior to reconciliation into short-Weierstrass form over prime fields. We then apply established cryptographic validations, including group-order factorization, cofactor bounds, twist security, and embedding-degree heuristics. A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that the pipeline functions as a retry-until-success Las Vegas algorithm, with complete transcripts enabling independent verification. Unlike seed-based or purely efficiency-driven designs, our approach embeds arithmetic structure into parameter selection while remaining compatible with constant-time, side-channel resistant implementations. This work broadens the design space for elliptic curves, showing that descent techniques from arithmetic geometry can underpin trust-enhancing, standardization-ready constructions.</description>

      <title>The shrinking target and recurrence problem for non-autonomous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the shrinking target and recurrence set associated to non-autonomous measure-preserving systems on compact metric spaces, establishing zero-one criteria in the spirit of classical Borel-Cantelli results. Our first main theorem gives a quantitative shrinking target result for non-autonomous systems under a uniform mixing condition, providing asymptotics with an optimal error term. This general result is applicable to certain families of inner functions, yielding concrete applications such as digit patterns in multi-base expansions. Turning to recurrence, we establish new zero-measure laws for non-autonomous systems. In the autonomous case, we prove a zero-one criterion for recurrence sets of centred, one-component inner functions via Markov partitions and distortion estimates. Together, these results provide a unified framework for shrinking target and recurrence problems in both autonomous and non-autonomous dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical van der Waerden theorem asserts that, for sufficiently large $n$, every colouring of $[n]$ contains either a monochromatic or a rainbow arithmetic progression of length $k$ ($k$-AP, for short). In this paper, we determine the threshold at which the binomial random subset $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this canonical Ramsey type property. As an application, we show the existence of sets $A\subseteq [n]$ such that the $k$-APs in $A$ define a $k$-uniform hypergraph of arbitrarily high girth and yet any colouring of $A$ induces a monochromatic or rainbow $k$-AP.</description>

      <title>Brauer-Manin obstructions for homogeneous spaces of commutative affine algebraic groups over global fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Questions related to Brauer-Manin obstructions to the Hasse principle and weak approximation for homogeneous spaces of tori over a number field are well-studied, generally using arithmetic duality theorems, starting with works of Sansuc and of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene. In this article, we prove the analogous statements (and include obstructions to strong approximation over finite places) in the general case of a commutative affine group scheme $G$ of finite type over a global field in any characteristic. We also study finiteness of different variants of the second Tate-Shafarevich kernel (such as $S$-kernels and $\omega$-kernels) of the Cartier dual of $G$. All this is made possible by some recent theoretical advancements in positive characteristic, namely the finiteness theorems of B. Conrad and the generalized Tate duality of Z. Rosengarten.</description>

      <title>Classicality of derived Emerton--Gee stack II: generalised reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Tannakian formalism to define the Emerton--Gee stack for general groups. For a flat algebraic group G over Z_p, we are able to prove the associated Emerton--Gee stack is a formal algebraic stack locally of finite presentation over Spf(Z_p). We also define a derived stack of Laurent F-crystals with G-structure on the absolute prismatic site, whose underlying classical stack is proved to be equivalent to the Emerton--Gee stack.
  In the case of connected reductive groups, we show that the derived stack of Laurent F-crystals with G-structure is classical in the sense that when restricted to truncated animated rings, it is the \'etale sheafification of the left Kan extension of the Emerton--Gee stack along the inclusion from classical commutative rings to animated rings. Moreover, when G is a generalised reductive group, the classicality result still holds for a modified version of the Emerton--Gee stack. In particular, this completes the picture that the derived stack of local Langlands parameters for the Langlands dual group of a reductive group is classical.</description>

Abstract: The greatest integer that does not belong to a numerical semigroup $S$ is called the Frobenius number of $S$, and finding the Frobenius number is called the Frobenius problem. In this paper, we solve the Frobenius problem for the numerical semigroups generated by binomial coefficients. As applications, we provide some nontrivial identities among binomial coefficients, and we also connect the main results to the theory of $(s,s+1,s+p)$-core partitions of integers.</description>

      <title>Shapes of unit lattices in $D_p$-number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unit group of the ring of integers of a number field, modulo torsion, is a lattice via the logarithmic Minkowski embedding. We examine the shape of this lattice, which we call the unit shape, within the family of prime degree $p$ number fields whose Galois closure has dihedral Galois group $D_p$ and a unique real embedding. In the case $p = 5$, we prove that the unit shapes lie on a single hypercycle on the modular surface (in this case, the modular surface is the space of shapes of rank $2$ lattices). For general $p$, we show that the unit shapes are contained in a finite union of translates of periodic torus orbits in the space of shapes.</description>

      <title>Unit lattices of $D_4$-quartic number fields with signature $(2,1)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest on distributions of shapes of unit lattices in number fields, due to both their applications to number theory and the lack of known results.
  In this work we focus on $D_4$-quartic fields with signature $(2,1)$; such fields have a rank $2$ unit group. Viewing the unit lattice as a point of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$, we prove that every lattice which arises this way must correspond to a transcendental point on the boundary of a certain fundamental domain of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$. Moreover, we produce three explicit (algebraic) points of $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash \mathfrak{h}$ which are limit points of the set of (points associated to) unit lattices of $D_4$-quartic fields with signature $(2,1)$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Minkowski constants and a function involving $\varphi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1887, Minkowski determined the least common multiple of the orders of all finite subgroups of $GL_n(\mathbb{Q})$; we refer to this number as $M(n)$. In (Katznelson, 1994), Katznelson provides the asymptotic behaviour of $M(n)$, with a small error term. In this paper, we use elementary techniques to find explicit upper and lower bounds on $M(n)$ that improve on Katznelson's results; we also recover his asymptotic result. Our results immediately imply explicit bounds on functions closely related to $M(n)$, which appear in the study of abelian varieties (see, for example, (Silverberg, 1992), (Guralnick and Kedlaya, 2017) and (Ozeki, 2024)). Finally, we examine the function $\Phi(n)$, which also appears in (Ozeki, 2024), defined as the greatest positive integer $m$ for which $\varphi(m)$ divides $2n$. We provide explicit upper bounds on $\Phi(n)$.</description>

      <title>Parity of the partition function in quadratic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parity of the partition function $p(n)$ remains strikingly mysterious. Beyond a handful of fragmentary results, essentially nothing is known about the distribution of parity. We prove a uniform result on quadratic progressions. If $1&lt;D\equiv 23\pmod{24}$ is square-free and only divisible by primes $\ell\equiv 1, 7\pmod 8$, then both parities occur infinitely often among $$ p\left(\frac{Dm^2+1}{24}\right), $$ with $(m,6)=1.$ The argument takes place on the modular curve $X_0(6)$ and shows that parity along these thin orbits is \emph{not constant}. The proof connects classical identities for the partition generating function, through the method of (twisted) Borcherds products, to the arithmetic geometry of {\it ordinary} CM fibers on the Deligne-Rapoport model of $X_0(6)$ in characteristic 2. This result is a special case of a general theorem for the coefficients of suitable vector-valued weight 1/2 harmonic Maass forms that satisfy a "Heegner packet'' condition.</description>
