      <title>Mean-Variance Stackelberg Games with Asymmetric Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers two investors who perform mean-variance portfolio selection with asymmetric information: one knows the true stock dynamics, while the other has to infer the true dynamics from observed stock evolution. Their portfolio selection is interconnected through relative performance concerns, i.e., each investor is concerned about not only her terminal wealth, but how it compares to the average terminal wealth of both investors. We model this as Stackelberg competition: the partially-informed investor (the "follower") observes the trading behavior of the fully-informed investor (the "leader") and decides her trading strategy accordingly; the leader, anticipating the follower's response, in turn selects a trading strategy that best suits her objective. To prevent information leakage, the leader adopts a randomized strategy selected under an entropy-regularized mean-variance objective, where the entropy regularizer quantifies the randomness of a chosen strategy. The follower, on the other hand, observes only the actual trading actions of the leader (sampled from the randomized strategy), but not the randomized strategy itself. Her mean-variance objective is thus a random field, in the form of an expectation conditioned on a realized path of the leader's trading actions. In the idealized case of continuous sampling of the leader's trading actions, we derive a Stackelberg equilibrium where the follower's trading strategy depends linearly on the actual trading actions of the leader and the leader samples her trading actions from Gaussian distributions. In the realistic case of discrete sampling of the leader's trading actions, the above becomes an $\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Regulation or Competition:Major-Minor Optimal Liquidation across Dark and Lit Pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal liquidation problem in both lit and dark pools for investors facing execution uncertainty in a continuous-time setting with market impact. First, we design an optimal make--take fee policy for a large investor liquidating her position across both pools, interacting with small investors who pay trading fees. We explicitly characterize the large investor's optimal liquidation strategies in both lit and dark pools using BSDEs under a compensation scheme proposed by an exchange to mitigate market impact in the lit venue. Second, we consider a purely competitive model with major--minor traders in the absence of regulation. We provide explicit solutions to the associated HJB--Fokker--Planck system. Finally, we illustrate our results through numerical experiments, comparing market impact under a regulated market with a strategic large investor to that in a purely competitive market with both small and large investors.</description>

      <title>Model-free portfolio allocation in continuous-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-probabilistic, path-by-path framework for studying path-dependent (i.e., where weight is a functional of time and historical time-series), long-only portfolio allocation in continuous-time based on [Chiu &amp; Cont '23], where the fundamental concept of self-financing was introduced, independent of any integration theory. In this article, we extend this concept to a portfolio allocation strategy and characterize it by a path-dependent partial differential equation. We derive the general explicit solution that describes the evolution of wealth in generic markets, including price paths that may not evolve continuously or exhibit variation of any order. Explicit solution examples are provided.
  As an application of our continuous-time, path-dependent framework, we extend an aggregating algorithm of [Vovk '90] and the universal algorithm of [Cover '91] to continuous-time algorithms that combine multiple strategies into a single strategy. These continuous-time (meta) algorithms take multiple strategies as input (which may themselves be generated by other algorithms) and track the wealth generated by the best individual strategy and the best convex combination of strategies, with tracking error bounds in log wealth of order O(1) and O(ln t), respectively. This work extends Cover's theorem [Cover '91, Thm 6.1] to a continuous-time, model-free setting.</description>
