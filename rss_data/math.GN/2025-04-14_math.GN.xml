      <title>A Comprehensive Review of the Mapper Algorithm, a Topological Data Analysis Technique, and Its Applications Across Various Fields (2007-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mapper algorithm, a technique within topological data analysis (TDA), constructs a simplified graphical representation of high-dimensional data to uncover its underlying shape and structural patterns. The algorithm has attracted significant attention from researchers and has been applied across various disciplines. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no comprehensive review currently exists on the Mapper algorithm and its variants as applied across different fields of study between 2007 and 2025. This review addresses this gap and serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to apply or advance the algorithm. The reviewed literature comprises peer-reviewed articles retrieved from major academic databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, JSTOR, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore, using the keywords 'topological data analysis,' 'mapper algorithm,' and 'topological graph.' The study further provides an overview and a comparative analysis of the suitability of the most commonly used filter functions and clustering algorithms within the Mapper framework. Additionally, it examines current trends, identifies limitations, and proposes future research directions for the Mapper algorithm and its variants, emphasizing the need for developing effective methodologies to streamline the analysis of high-dimensional data in the age of big data proliferation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize those complete commutative positive linear ordered monoids $W$ such that whenever $f$ is a map from a Cauchy complete $W$-metric space to itself, the existence of a fixed point of $f$ is independent of the background model of set theory.</description>

      <title>MapperEEG: A Topological Approach to Brain State Clustering in EEG Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical potential scalp recordings (Electroencephalograms-EEGs) are a common tool used to investigate brain activity. EEG is routinely used in clinical applications as well as in research studies thanks to its noninvasive nature, relatively inexpensive equipment, and high temporal resolution. But, EEG is prone to contamination from movement artifacts and signals from external sources. Thus, it requires advanced signal processing and mathematical analysis methods in tasks requiring brain state identification. Recently, tools from topological data analysis have been used successfully across many domains, including brain research, however these uses have been limited to fMRI datasets. We introduce the topological tool MapperEEG (M-EEG) and provide an example of it's ability to separate different brain states during a simple finger tapping teaming task without any pre-labeling or prior knowledge. M-EEG uses the power spectral density applied to traditional EEG frequency bands combined with the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis to capture the underlying structure of the data and represent that structure as a graph in two-dimensional space. This tool provides clear separation (clustering) of states during different conditions of the experiment (syncopated vs. synchronized) and we demonstrate that M-EEG outperforms other clustering methods when applied to EEG data.</description>

      <title>Measure and dimension theory of permeable sets and its applications to fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study {\it permeable} sets. These are sets \(\Theta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) which have the property that each two points \(x,y\in \mathbb{R}^d\) can be connected by a short path \(\gamma\) which has small (or even empty, apart from the end points of \(\gamma\)) intersection with \(\Theta\). We investigate relations between permeability and Lebesgue measure and establish theorems on the relation of permeability with several notions of dimension. It turns out that for most notions of dimension each subset of \(\mathbb{R}^d\) of dimension less than \(d-1\) is permeable. We use our permeability result on the Nagata dimension to characterize permeability properties of self-similar sets with certain finiteness properties.</description>

      <title>What is Connectivity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a taxonomy of connectivity for space-like structures. It is inspired by isolating posets of connected pieces of a space and examining its embedding in the ambient space. The taxonomy includes in its scope all standard notions of connectivity in point-set and point-free contexts, such as connectivity in graphs and hypergraphs (as well as k-connectivity in graphs), connectivity and path-connectivity in topology, and connectivity of elements in a frame.</description>

      <title>Covering conditions for ideals in semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove prime avoidance for ringoids. We also generalize McCoy's and Davis' prime avoidance theorems in the context of semiring theory. Next, we proceed to define and characterize compactly packed semirings and show that a commutative semiring is compactly packed if and only if each prime ideal is the radical of a principal ideal. Finally, we calculate the set of zero-divisors of some monoid semimodules over compactly packed semirings in terms of their prime ideals.</description>
