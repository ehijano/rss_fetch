      <title>Towards More Economical Context-Augmented LLM Generation by Reusing Stored KV Cache</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across large language model (LLM) applications, we observe an emerging trend for reusing KV caches to save the prefill delays of processing repeated input texts in different LLM inputs. This has led to a broad design space, including colocating stored KV caches with (or close to) GPUs to various KV cache compression. However, a key question remains unanswered: can these delay reductions also be economically favorable? Specifically, we ask whether a developer can use public cloud services to store precomputed KV caches and reuse them to save delay without incurring more costs in terms of compute, storage, and network. To answer this question, we propose an validated analytical model for the cloud cost (in compute, storage, and network) of storing and reusing KV caches based on various workload parameters, such as reuse frequency, generated text lengths, model sizes, etc. Preliminary results show that KV cache reusing is able to save both delay and cloud cost across a range of workloads with long context. And we call more efforts on building more economical context augmented LLM by KV cache reusing.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Double-Reallocation Issue for IPv6 Lightweight Tunnel Encapsulations in the Linux Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight Tunnels (LWTs) in the Linux kernel enable efficient per-route tunneling and are widely used by protocols such as In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM), Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6), and Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). However, a performance issue was detected in their implementations, where a double-reallocation of socket buffers occurs under specific conditions, leading to significant throughput degradation. This paper investigates the root cause of the issue, which depends on the architecture of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the Network Interface Card (NIC). We propose a patch for the Linux kernel to fix this problem, replacing the double-reallocation with a single, efficient one. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the patch eliminates the inefficiency, improving forwarding rates by up to 28.8% for affected protocols.</description>

      <title>6GStarLab -- A CubeSat Mission to support the development and standardization of Non-Terrestrial Networks towards 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) concept in the last years has revolutionized the space industry. This novel network architecture composed of aircraft and spacecraft is currently being standardized by the 3GPP. This standardization process follows dedicated phases in which experimentation of the technology is needed. Although some missions have been conducted to demonstrate specific and service-centric technologies, a open flexible in-orbit infrastructure is demanded to support this standardization process. This work presents the 6GStarLab mission, which aims to address this gap. Specifically, this mission envisions to provide a 6U CubeSat as the main in-orbit infrastructure in which multiple technology validations can be uploaded. The concept of this mission is depicted. Additionally, this work presents the details of the satellite platform and the payload. This last one is designed to enable the experimentation in multiple radio-frequency bands (i.e. UHF, S-, X-, and Ka-bands) and an optical terminal. The launch of the satellite is scheduled for Q2 2025, and it will contribute to the standardization of future NTN architectures.</description>

      <title>A Robust Routing Protocol for 5G Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a novel routing protocol suitable for ad-hoc networks with dynamically changing topologies, such as DECT 2020 NR (NR+) systems, which often lead to missing links between the nodes and thus, incomplete or inefficient routes. A key point of the proposed protocol is the combination of network discovery and matrix completion techniques, which allow the nodes to establish communication paths efficiently and reliably. Additionally, multihop localization is performed to estimate the location of the nodes without needing to broadcast each node's geographical position, thus preserving privacy during the routing process and enabling nodes in the network to independently find potentially missing paths in a decentralized manner instead of flooding the whole network. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed technique in terms of the average number of hops of the obtained routes in different scenarios, with different network densities and amounts of incompleteness.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Based Beamformed Resource Allocation in Standalone Millimeter-Wave Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 3GPP New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), the new standard for next-generation vehicular networks, vehicles can autonomously select sidelink resources for data transmission, which permits network operations without cellular coverage. However, standalone resource allocation is uncoordinated, and is complicated by the high mobility of the nodes that may introduce unforeseen channel collisions (e.g., when a transmitting vehicle changes path) or free up resources (e.g., when a vehicle moves outside of the communication area). Moreover, unscheduled resource allocation is prone to the hidden node and exposed node problems, which are particularly critical considering directional transmissions. In this paper, we implement and demonstrate a new channel access scheme for NR V2X in Frequency Range 2 (FR2), i.e., at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, based on directional and beamformed transmissions along with Sidelink Control Information (SCI) to select resources for transmission. We prove via simulation that this approach can reduce the probability of collision for resource allocation, compared to a baseline solution that does not configure SCI transmissions.</description>

      <title>The Effects of iBGP Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing violations of forwarding properties is a classic networking problem. However, existing work is either tailored to the steady state -- and not to transient states during iBGP convergence -- or does analyze transient violations but with inaccurate proxies, like control-plane convergence, or without precise control over the different impact factors.
  We address this gap with a measurement framework that controllably and accurately measures transient violation times in realistic network deployments. The framework relies on a programmable switch to flexibly emulate diverse topologies and gain traffic visibility at all links -- enabling accurately inferring violation times of any forwarding property. Using the framework, we analyze 50 network scenarios on a topology with 12 real routers, and show how factors like the network configuration and BGP event affect transient violation times. Further, we shed light on less-known aspects of BGP convergence, including that transient violations can start before the trigger event, or that keeping a backup route advertised at all times can increase violation times.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Delay Forecasting in 5G Using Recurrent and Attention-Based Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of new application areas such as cyber-physical systems and human-in-the-loop applications ensuring a specific level of end-to-end network latency with high reliability (e.g., 99.9%) is becoming increasingly critical. To align wireless links with these reliability requirements, it is essential to analyze and control network latency in terms of its full probability distribution. However, in a wireless link, the distribution may vary over time, making this task particularly challenging. We propose predicting the latency distribution using state-of-the-art data-driven techniques that leverage historical network information. Our approach tokenizes network state information and processes it using temporal deep-learning architectures-namely LSTM and Transformer models-to capture both short- and long-term delay dependencies. These models output parameters for a chosen parametric density via a mixture density network with Gaussian mixtures, yielding multi-step probabilistic forecasts of future delays. To validate our proposed approach, we implemented and tested these methods using a time-synchronized, SDR-based OpenAirInterface 5G testbed to collect and preprocess network-delay data. Our experiments show that the Transformer model achieves lower negative log-likelihood and mean absolute error than both LSTM and feed-forward baselines in challenging scenarios, while also providing insights into model complexity and training/inference overhead. This framework enables more informed decision-making for adaptive scheduling and resource allocation, paving the way toward enhanced QoS in evolving 5G and 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Optimum Network Slicing for Ultra-reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) Services in Campus Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within 3GPP, the campus network architecture has evolved as a deployment option for industries and can be provisioned using network slicing over already installed 5G public network infrastructure. In campus networks, the ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) service category is of major interest for applications with strict latency and high-reliability requirements. One way to achieve high reliability in a shared infrastructure is through resource isolation, whereby network slicing can be optimized to adequately reserve computation and transmission capacity. This paper proposes an approach for vertical slicing the radio access network (RAN) to enable the deployment of multiple and isolated campus networks to accommodate URLLC services. To this end, we model RAN function placement as a mixed integer linear programming problem with URLLC-related constraints. We demonstrate that our approach can find optimal solutions in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, unlike existing solutions, our model considers the user traffic flow from a known source node on the network's edge to an unknown \textit{a priori} destination node. This flexibility could be explored in industrial campus networks by allowing dynamic placement of user plane functions (UPFs) to serve the URLLC.</description>

      <title>Transparent Attested DNS for Confidential Computing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confidential services running in hardware-protected Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) can provide higher security assurance, but this requires custom clients and protocols to distribute, update, and verify their attestation evidence. Compared with classic Internet security, built upon universal abstractions such as domain names, origins, and certificates, this puts a significant burden on service users and providers. In particular, Web browsers and other legacy clients do not get the same security guaranties as custom clients.
  We present a new approach for users to establish trust in confidential services. We propose attested DNS (aDNS): a name service that securely binds the attested implementation of confidential services to their domain names. ADNS enforces policies for all names in its zone of authority: any TEE that runs a service must present hardware attestation that complies with the domain-specific policy before registering keys and obtaining certificates for any name in this domain. ADNS provides protocols for zone delegation, TEE registration, and certificate issuance. ADNS builds on standards such as DNSSEC, DANE, ACME and Certificate Transparency. ADNS provides DNS transparency by keeping all records, policies, and attestations in a public append-only log, thereby enabling auditing and preventing targeted attacks.
  We implement aDNS as a confidential service using a fault-tolerant network of TEEs. We evaluate it using sample confidential services that illustrate various TEE platforms. On the client side, we provide a generic browser extension that queries and verifies attestation records before opening TLS connections, with negligible performance overhead, and we show that, with aDNS, even legacy Web clients benefit from confidential computing as long as some enlightened clients verify attestations to deter or blame malicious actors.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Purification of Entanglement States in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider problems of distributing high-fidelity entangled states across nodes of a quantum network. We consider a repeater-based network architecture with entanglement swapping (fusion) operations for generating long-distance entanglements, and purification operations that produce high-fidelity states from several lower-fidelity states. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, while there have been several works on fidelity-aware routing and incorporating purification into routing for generating EPs, this paper presents the first algorithms for optimal solutions to the high-fidelity EP distribution problem. We provide a dynamic programming algorithm for generating the optimal tree of operations to produce a high-fidelity EP, and an LP-based algorithm for generating an optimal collection of trees. Second, following the EP algorithms, this paper presents the first algorithms for the high-fidelity GHZ-state distribution problem and characterizes its optimality. We evaluate our techniques via simulations over NetSquid, a quantum network simulator.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with Harmonic Annealing Pruning for Dynamic Spectrum Access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has emerged as a powerful tool for optimizing decentralized decision-making systems in complex settings, such as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to their high computational cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a novel sparse recurrent MARL framework integrating gradual neural network pruning into the independent actor global critic paradigm. Additionally, we introduce a harmonic annealing sparsity scheduler, which achieves comparable, and in certain cases superior, performance to standard linear and polynomial pruning schedulers at large sparsities. Our experimental investigation demonstrates that the proposed DSA framework can discover superior policies, under diverse training conditions, outperforming conventional DSA, MADRL baselines, and state-of-the-art pruning techniques.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Medium Access with Distributed Belief Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication entails the timely transmission of updates related to a specific goal defined by the application. In a distributed setup with multiple sensors, each individual sensor knows its own observation and can determine its freshness, as measured by Age of Incorrect Information (AoII). This local knowledge is suited for distributed medium access, where the transmission strategies have to deal with collisions. We present Dynamic Epistemic Logic for Tracking Anomalies (DELTA), a medium access protocol that limits collisions and minimizes AoII in anomaly reporting over dense networks. Each sensor knows its own AoII, while it can compute the belief about the AoII for all other sensors, based on their Age of Information (AoI), which is inferred from the acknowledgments. This results in a goal-oriented approach based on dynamic epistemic logic emerging from public information. We analyze the resulting DELTA protocol both from a theoretical standpoint and with Monte Carlo simulations, showing that it is significantly more efficient and robust than classical random access, while outperforming state-of-the-art scheduled schemes by at least 30%, even with imperfect feedback.</description>

      <title>Enhancements to P4TG: Protocols, Performance, and Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: P4TG is a hardware-based traffic generator (TG) running on the Intel Tofino 1 ASIC and was programmed using the programming language P4. In its initial version, P4TG could generate up to 10x100 Gb/s of traffic and directly measure rates, packet loss, and other metrics in the data plane. Many researchers and industrial partners requested new features to be incorporated into P4TG since its publication in 2023. With the recently added features, P4TG supports the generation of packets encapsulated with a customizable VLAN, QinQ, VxLAN, MPLS, and SRv6 header. Further, generation of IPv6 traffic is added and P4TG is ported to the Intel Tofino 2 platform enabling a generation capability of up to 10x400 Gb/s. The improvement in user experience focuses on ease of operation. Features like automated ARP replies, improved visualization, report generation, and automated testing based on the IMIX distribution and RFC 2544 are added. Future work on P4TG includes NDP to facilitate IPv6 traffic, and a NETCONF integration to further ease the configuration.</description>

      <title>Rust Barefoot Runtime (RBFRT): Fast Runtime Control for the Intel Tofino</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17271v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data plane programming enables the programmability of network devices with domain-specific programming languages, like P4. One commonly used P4-programmable hardware target is the Intel Tofino switching ASIC. The runtime behavior of an implemented P4 program on Tofino can be configured with shell scripts or a Python library from Barefoot provided with the Tofino. Both are limited in their capabilities and usability. This paper introduces the Rust Barefoot Runtime (RBFRT), a Rust-based control plane library. The RBFRT provides a fast and memory-safe interface to configure the Intel Tofino. We showed that the RBFRT achieves a higher insertion rate for MAT entries and has a shorter response time compared to the Python library.</description>

Abstract: The vision of autonomous systems is becoming increasingly important in many application areas, where the aim is to replace humans with agents. These include autonomous vehicles and other agents' applications in business processes and problem-solving. For networks, the increasing scale and operation and management (O&amp;M) complexity drive the need for autonomous networks (AN). The technical objective of AN is to ensure trustworthy O&amp;M without human intervention for higher efficiency and lower operating costs. However, realizing AN seems more difficult than autonomous vehicles. It encounters challenges of networks' structural and functional complexity, which operate as distributed dynamic systems governed by various technical and economic constraints. A key problem lies in formulating a rigorous development methodology that facilitates a seamless transition from traditional networks to AN. Central to this methodology is the definition of a reference architecture for network agents, which specifies the required functionalities for their realization, regardless of implementation choices. This article proposes a reference architecture characterizing main functional features, illustrating its application with network use cases. It shows how artificial intelligence components can be used to implement the required functionality and its coordination. The latter is achieved through the management and generation of shared domain-specific knowledge stored in long-term memory, ensuring the overall consistency of decisions and their execution. The article concludes with a discussion of architecture specialization for building network layer agents. It also identifies the main technical challenges ahead, such as satisfying essential requirements at development or runtime, as well as the issue of coordinating agents to achieve collective intelligence in meeting overall network goals.</description>

      <title>SARLink: Satellite Backscatter Connectivity using Synthetic Aperture Radar</title>

Abstract: SARLink is a passive satellite backscatter communication system that uses existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging satellites to provide connectivity in remote regions. It achieves orders of magnitude more range than traditional backscatter systems, enabling communication between a passive ground node and a satellite in low earth orbit. The system is composed of a cooperative ground target, a SAR satellite, and a data processing algorithm. A mechanically modulating reflector was designed to apply amplitude modulation to ambient SAR backscatter signals by changing its radar cross section. These communication bits are extracted from the raw SAR data using an algorithm that leverages subaperture processing to detect multiple bits from a target in a single image dataset. A theoretical analysis of this communication system using on-off keying is presented, including the expected signal model, throughput, and bit error rate. The results suggest a 5.5 ft by 5.5 ft modulating corner reflector could send 60 bits every satellite pass, enough to support low bandwidth sensor data and messages. Using Sentinel-1A, a SAR satellite at an altitude of 693~km, we deployed static and modulating reflectors to evaluate the system. The results, successfully detecting the changing state of a modulating ground target, demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness for extracting bits, paving the way for ultra-long-range, low-power satellite backscatter communication.</description>

      <title>Optimized Distribution of Entanglement Graph States in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00222</link>

Abstract: Building large-scale quantum computers, essential to demonstrating quantum advantage, is a key challenge. Quantum Networks (QNs) can help address this challenge by enabling the construction of large, robust, and more capable quantum computing platforms by connecting smaller quantum computers. Moreover, unlike classical systems, QNs can enable fully secured long-distance communication. Thus, quantum networks lie at the heart of the success of future quantum information technologies. In quantum networks, multipartite entangled states distributed over the network help implement and support many quantum network applications for communications, sensing, and computing. Our work focuses on developing optimal techniques to generate and distribute multipartite entanglement states efficiently. Prior works on generating general multipartite entanglement states have focused on the objective of minimizing the number of maximally entangled pairs (EPs) while ignoring the heterogeneity of the network nodes and links as well as the stochastic nature of underlying processes. In this work, we develop a hypergraph based linear programming framework that delivers optimal (under certain assumptions) generation schemes for general multipartite entanglement represented by graph states, under the network resources, decoherence, and fidelity constraints, while considering the stochasticity of the underlying processes. We illustrate our technique by developing generation schemes for the special cases of path and tree graph states, and discuss optimized generation schemes for more general classes of graph states. Using extensive simulations over a quantum network simulator (NetSquid), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed techniques and show that they outperform prior known schemes by up to orders of magnitude.</description>
