      <title>Data-driven Modeling for Grid Edge IBRs: A Digital Twin Perspective of User-Defined Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Odessa disturbance events have brought attention to the challenges associated with the interaction between Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) and the transmission and distribution system. The NERC event diagnosis report has highlighted several issues, emphasizing the need for continuous performance monitoring of these IBRs by system operators. Key areas of concern include the mismatch of control and protection performance of IBRs between the original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-provided models and field measurements. The inability to replicate the realistic response can result in incorrect reliability and resilience studies. In this paper, we developed an approach on how to emulate the behavior of an IBR using measurement data obtained for system operators to utilize in real-time and long-term planning. Two experiments are conducted in the phasor domain and electromagnetic transients (EMT) domain to emulate the behavior for grid forming and grid following inverters under various operating conditions and the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated in terms of accuracy and ease of utilizing user-defined models (UDMs).</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Learning for Few-Shot Online Adaptation under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) seeks to improve the generalized performance of learning specific tasks, exploiting useful information incorporated in related tasks. As a promising area, this paper studies an MTL-based control approach considering Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Task compliance is measured via the Robustness Degree (RD) which is computed by using the STL semantics. A suitable methodology is provided to solve the learning and testing stages, with an appropriate treatment of the non-convex terms in the quadratic objective function and using Sequential Convex Programming based on trust region update. In the learning stage, an ensemble of tasks is generated from deterministic goals to obtain a strong initializer for the testing stage, where related tasks are solved with a larger impact of perturbation. The methodology demonstrates to be robust in two dynamical systems showing results that meet the task specifications in a few shots for the testing stage, even for highly perturbed tasks.</description>

      <title>Hidden Cyber-Physical Contingency Identification, Classification and Evaluation in Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced stochastic hybrid system modeling framework for modern power systems (MPS) to identify, classify, and evaluate hidden contingencies, which cannot be detected by normal observation sensors. The stochastic hybrid system (SHS) model is designed to capture the dynamics of the internal states of individual nodes, considering their structural properties, and coupling variables under various local and network-level contingencies. Hidden contingencies are identified using a probing approach that measures changes in the eigenvalues of the SHS model and detects deviations from normal operation. Next, contingencies are categorized into three distinct groups according to their impact on MPS: physical contingencies, control network contingencies, and sensing and measurement network contingencies. This classification enables a proactive evaluation of contingencies. The practicality and efficacy of the proposed methodology are validated through simulation experiments on the electrical network of two real-world systems. These simulations underscore the approach's capacity to enhance the resilience of power systems against a spectrum of hidden contingencies.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of High-Order Harmonic Generation in Electrical Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern power grid has seen a rise in the integration of non-linear loads, presenting a significant concern for operators. These loads introduce unwanted harmonics, leading to potential issues such as overheating and improper functioning of circuit breakers. In pursuing a more sustainable grid, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and photovoltaic (PV) systems in residential networks has increased. Understanding and examining the effects of high-order harmonic frequencies beyond $1.5$ kHz is crucial to understanding their impact on the operation and planning of electrical distribution systems under varying nonlinear loading conditions. This study investigates a diverse set of critical power electronic loads within a household modeled using PSCAD/EMTdc, analyzing their unique harmonic spectra. This information is utilized to run the time-series harmonic analysis program in OpenDSS on a modified IEEE 34 bus test system model. The impact of high-order harmonics is quantified using metrics that evaluate total harmonic distortion (THD), transformer harmonic-driven eddy current loss component, and propagation of harmonics from the source to the substation transformer.</description>

      <title>RF Power Transmission for Self-sustaining Miniaturized IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) wireless power transfer is a promising technology that has the potential to constantly power small Internet of Things (IoT) devices, enabling even battery-less systems and reducing their maintenance requirements. However, to achieve this ambitious goal, carefully designed RF energy harvesting (EH) systems are needed to minimize the conversion losses and the conversion efficiency of the limited power. For intelligent internet of things sensors and devices, which often have non-constant power requirements, an additional power management stage with energy storage is needed to temporarily provide a higher power output than the power being harvested. This paper proposes an RF wireless power energy conversion system for miniaturized IoT composed of an impedance matching network, a rectifier, and power management with energy storage. The proposed sub-system has been experimentally validated and achieved an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 30 % for an input power of -10 dBm and a peak efficiency of 57 % at 3 dBm.</description>

      <title>H-Watch: An Open, Connected Platform for AI-Enhanced COVID19 Infection Symptoms Monitoring and Contact Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel COVID-19 disease has been declared a pandemic event. Early detection of infection symptoms and contact tracing are playing a vital role in containing COVID-19 spread. As demonstrated by recent literature, multi-sensor and connected wearable devices might enable symptom detection and help tracing contacts, while also acquiring useful epidemiological information. This paper presents the design and implementation of a fully open-source wearable platform called H-Watch. It has been designed to include several sensors for COVID-19 early detection, multi-radio for wireless transmission and tracking, a microcontroller for processing data on-board, and finally, an energy harvester to extend the battery lifetime. Experimental results demonstrated only 5.9 mW of average power consumption, leading to a lifetime of 9 days on a small watch battery. Finally, all the hardware and the software, including a machine learning on MCU toolkit, are provided open-source, allowing the research community to build and use the H-Watch.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We collect papers forecasting wind turbine failures at least two days in advance. We examine the prediction time, methods, failed components, and dataset size. We investigate the effect of using standard SCADA data and data from additional sensors, such as those measuring vibration. We observe a positive correlation between dataset size and prediction time. In the considered cases, one may roughly expect a forecast for at least two days using a dataset of one turbine year and a forecast for two hundred days from a dataset of a hundred turbine years.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Functional Insufficiencies and Triggering Conditions to Improve the SOTIF of an MPC-based Trajectory Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21569v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated and autonomous driving has made a significant technological leap over the past decade. In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Reliability Benefits of Energy Storage as a Transmission Asset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing energy storage solutions to reduce the need for traditional transmission investments has been recognized by system planners and supported by federal policies in recent years. This work demonstrates the need for detailed reliability assessment for quantitative comparison of the reliability benefits of energy storage and traditional transmission investments. First, a mixed-integer linear programming expansion planning model considering candidate transmission lines and storage technologies is solved to find the least-cost investment decisions. Next, operations under the resulting system configuration are simulated in a probabilistic reliability assessment which accounts for weather-dependent forced outages. The outcome of this work, when applied to TPPs, is to further equalize the consideration of energy storage compared to traditional transmission assets by capturing the value of storage for system reliability.</description>

      <title>Optimal price signal generation for demand-side energy management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable Energy Sources play a key role in smart energy systems. To achieve 100% renewable energy, utilizing the flexibility potential on the demand side becomes the cost-efficient option to balance the grid. However, it is not trivial to exploit these available capacities and flexibility options profitably. The amount of available flexibility is a complex and time-varying function of the price signal and weather forecasts. In this work, we use a Flexibility Function to represent the relationship between the price signal and the demand and investigate optimization problems for the price signal computation. Consequently, this study considers the higher and lower levels in the hierarchy from the markets to appliances, households, and districts. This paper investigates optimal price generation via the Flexibility Function and studies its employment in controller design for demand-side management, its capability to provide ancillary services for balancing throughout the Smart Energy Operating System, and its effect on the physical level performance. Sequential and simultaneous approaches for computing the price signal, along with various cost functions are analyzed and compared. Simulation results demonstrate the generated price/penalty signal and its employment in a model predictive controller.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Abstractions via Binary-Tree Gaussian Processes for Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To advance formal verification of stochastic systems against temporal logic requirements for handling unknown dynamics, researchers have been designing data-driven approaches inspired by breakthroughs in the underlying machine learning techniques. As one promising research direction, abstraction-based solutions based on Gaussian process (GP) regression have become popular for their ability to learn a representation of the latent system from data with a quantified error. Results obtained based on this model are then translated to the true system via various methods. In a recent publication, GPs using a so-called binary-tree kernel have demonstrated a polynomial speedup w.r.t. the size of the data compared to their vanilla version, outcompeting all existing sparse GP approximations. Incidentally, the resulting binary-tree Gaussian process (BTGP) is characteristic for its piecewise-constant posterior mean and covariance functions, naturally abstracting the input space into discrete partitions. In this paper, we leverage this natural abstraction of the BTGP for formal verification, eliminating the need for cumbersome abstraction and error quantification procedures. We show that the BTGP allows us to construct an interval Markov chain model of the unknown system with a speedup that is polynomial w.r.t. the size of the abstraction compared to alternative approaches. We provide a delocalized error quantification via a unified formula even when the true dynamics do not live in the function space of the BTGP. This allows us to compute upper and lower bounds on the probability of satisfying reachability specifications that are robust to both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Decentralized and Uncoordinated Learning of Stable Matchings: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning stable matchings in a fully decentralized and uncoordinated manner. In this problem, there are $n$ men and $n$ women, each having preference over the other side. It is assumed that women know their preferences over men, but men are not aware of their preferences over women, and they only learn them if they propose and successfully get matched to women. A matching is called stable if no man and woman prefer each other over their current matches. When all the preferences are known a priori, the celebrated Deferred-Acceptance algorithm proposed by Gale and Shapley provides a decentralized and uncoordinated algorithm to obtain a stable matching. However, when the preferences are unknown, developing such an algorithm faces major challenges due to a lack of coordination. We achieve this goal by making a connection between stable matchings and learning Nash equilibria (NE) in noncooperative games. First, we provide a complete information game formulation for the stable matching problem with known preferences such that its set of pure NE coincides with the set of stable matchings, while its mixed NE can be rounded in a decentralized manner to a stable matching. Relying on such a game-theoretic formulation, we show that for hierarchical markets, adopting the exponential weight (EXP) learning algorithm for the stable matching game achieves logarithmic regret with polynomial dependence on the number of players, thus answering a question posed in previous literature. Moreover, we show that the same EXP learning algorithm converges locally and exponentially fast to a stable matching in general matching markets. We complement this result by introducing another decentralized and uncoordinated learning algorithm that globally converges to a stable matching with arbitrarily high probability, leveraging the weak acyclicity property of the stable matching game.</description>

      <title>Who should I trust? A Visual Analytics Approach for Comparing Net Load Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Net load forecasting is crucial for energy planning and facilitating informed decision-making regarding trade and load distributions. However, evaluating forecasting models' performance against benchmark models remains challenging, thereby impeding experts' trust in the model's performance. In this context, there is a demand for technological interventions that allow scientists to compare models across various timeframes and solar penetration levels. This paper introduces a visual analytics-based application designed to compare the performance of deep-learning-based net load forecasting models with other models for probabilistic net load forecasting. This application employs carefully selected visual analytic interventions, enabling users to discern differences in model performance across different solar penetration levels, dataset resolutions, and hours of the day over multiple months. We also present observations made using our application through a case study, demonstrating the effectiveness of visualizations in aiding scientists in making informed decisions and enhancing trust in net load forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Hyper parametric timed CTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperproperties enable simultaneous reasoning about multiple execution traces of a system and are useful to reason about non-interference, opacity, robustness, fairness, observational determinism, etc. We introduce hyper parametric timed computation tree logic (HyperPTCTL), extending hyperlogics with timing reasoning and, notably, parameters to express unknown values. We mainly consider its nest-free fragment, where temporal operators cannot be nested. However, we allow extensions that enable counting actions and comparing the duration since the most recent occurrence of specific actions. We show that our nest-free fragment with this extension is sufficiently expressive to encode properties, e.g., opacity, (un)fairness, or robust observational (non-)determinism. We propose semi-algorithms for model checking and synthesis of parametric timed automata (an extension of timed automata with timing parameters) against this nest-free fragment with the extension via reduction to PTCTL model checking and synthesis. While the general model checking (and thus synthesis) problem is undecidable, we show that a large part of our extended (yet nest-free) fragment is decidable, provided the parameters only appear in the property, not in the model. We also exhibit additional decidable fragments where parameters within the model are allowed. We implemented our semi-algorithms on top of the IMITATOR model checker, and performed experiments. Our implementation supports most of the nest-free fragments (beyond the decidable classes). The experimental results highlight our method's practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning In-Sensors: Computation-enabled Intelligent Sensors For Next Generation of IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart sensors are an emerging technology that allows combining the data acquisition with the elaboration directly on the Edge device, very close to the sensors. To push this concept to the extreme, technology companies are proposing a new generation of sensors allowing to move the intelligence from the edge host device, typically a microcontroller, directly to the ultra-low-power sensor itself, in order to further reduce the miniaturization, cost and energy efficiency. This paper evaluates the capabilities of a novel and promising solution from STMicroelectronics. The presence of a floating point unit and an accelerator for binary neural networks provide capabilities for in-sensor feature extraction and machine learning. We propose a comparison of full-precision and binary neural networks for activity recognition with accelerometer data generated by the sensor itself. Experimental results have demonstrated that the sensor can achieve an inference performance of 10.7 cycles/MAC, comparable to a Cortex-M4-based microcontroller, with full-precision networks, and up to 1.5 cycles/MAC with large binary models for low latency inference, with an average energy consumption of only 90 $\mu$J/inference with the core running at 5 MHz.</description>

      <title>CXSimulator: A User Behavior Simulation using LLM Embeddings for Web-Marketing Campaign Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Customer Experience (CX) Simulator, a novel framework designed to assess the effects of untested web-marketing campaigns through user behavior simulations. The proposed framework leverages large language models (LLMs) to represent various events in a user's behavioral history, such as viewing an item, applying a coupon, or purchasing an item, as semantic embedding vectors. We train a model to predict transitions between events from their LLM embeddings, which can even generalize to unseen events by learning from diverse training data. In web-marketing applications, we leverage this transition prediction model to simulate how users might react differently when new campaigns or products are presented to them. This allows us to eliminate the need for costly online testing and enhance the marketers' abilities to reveal insights. Our numerical evaluation and user study, utilizing BigQuery Public Datasets from the Google Merchandise Store, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Energy Management for Microgrid with Hybrid Hydrogen-Battery Energy Storage: A Prediction-Free Coordinated Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the long-term energy management of a microgrid coordinating hybrid hydrogen-battery energy storage. We develop an approximate semi-empirical hydrogen storage model to accurately capture the power-dependent efficiency of hydrogen storage. We introduce a prediction-free two-stage coordinated optimization framework, which generates the annual state-of-charge (SoC) reference for hydrogen storage offline. During online operation, it updates the SoC reference online using kernel regression and makes operation decisions based on the proposed adaptive virtual-queue-based online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm. We innovatively incorporate penalty terms for long-term pattern tracking and expert-tracking for step size updates. We provide theoretical proof to show that the proposed OCO algorithm achieves a sublinear bound of dynamic regret without using prediction information. Numerical studies based on the Elia and North China datasets show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the existing online optimization approaches by reducing the operational costs and loss of load by around 30% and 80%, respectively. These benefits can be further enhanced with optimized settings for the penalty coefficient and step size of OCO, as well as more historical references.</description>

      <title>A Simulative Study on Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) as a Control Tool for Practitioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.04596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an alternative to both classical PID-type and modern model-based approaches to solving control problems, active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) has gained significant traction in recent years. With its simple tuning method and robustness against process parameter variations, it puts itself forward as a valuable addition to the toolbox of control engineering practitioners. This article aims at providing a single-source introduction and reference to linear ADRC with this audience in mind. A simulative study is carried out using generic first- and second-order plants to enable a quick visual assessment of the abilities of ADRC. Finally, a modified form of the discrete-time case is introduced to speed up real-time implementations as necessary in applications with high dynamic requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.01044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To support the adoption of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) in industrial practice, this article aims at improving both understanding and implementation of ADRC using traditional means, in particular via transfer functions and a frequency-domain view. Firstly, to enable an immediate comparability with existing classical control solutions, a realizable transfer function implementation of continous-time linear ADRC is introduced. Secondly, a frequency-domain analysis of ADRC components, performance, parameter sensitivity, and tuning method is performed. Finally, an exact implementation of discrete-time ADRC using transfer functions is introduced for the first time, with special emphasis on practical aspects such as computational efficiency, low parameter footprint, and windup protection.</description>

      <title>Impact of data for forecasting on performance of model predictive control in buildings with smart energy storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data is required to develop forecasting models for use in Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemes in building energy systems. However, data is costly to both collect and exploit. Determining cost optimal data usage strategies requires understanding of the forecast accuracy and resulting MPC operational performance it enables. This study investigates the performance of both simple and state-of-the-art machine learning prediction models for MPC in multi-building energy systems using a simulated case study with historic building energy data. The impact on forecast accuracy of measures to improve model data efficiency are quantified, specifically for: reuse of prediction models, reduction of training data duration, reduction of model data features, and online model training. A simple linear multi-layer perceptron model is shown to provide equivalent forecast accuracy to state-of-the-art models, with greater data efficiency and generalisability. The use of more than 2 years of training data for load prediction models provided no significant improvement in forecast accuracy. Forecast accuracy and data efficiency were improved simultaneously by using change-point analysis to screen training data. Reused models and those trained with 3 months of data had on average 10% higher error than baseline, indicating that deploying MPC systems without prior data collection may be economic.</description>

      <title>A Concept for Semi-Automatic Configuration of Sufficiently Valid Simulation Setups for Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As simulation is increasingly used in scenario-based approaches to test Automated Driving Systems, the credibility of simulation results is a major concern. Arguably, credibility depends on the validity of the simulation setup and simulation models. When selecting appropriate simulation models, a trade-off must be made between validity, often connected to the model's fidelity, and cost of computation. However, due to the large number of test cases, expert-based methods to create sufficiently valid simulation setups seem infeasible. We propose using design contracts in order to semi-automatically compose simulation setups for given test cases from simulation models and to derive requirements for the simulation models, supporting separation of concerns between simulation model developers and users. Simulation model contracts represent their validity domains by capturing a validity guarantee and the associated operating conditions in an assumption. We then require the composition of the simulation model contracts to refine a test case contract. The latter contract captures the operating conditions of the test case in its assumption and validity requirements in its guarantee. Based on this idea, we present a framework that supports the compositional configuration of simulation setups based on the contracts and a method to derive runtime monitors for these simulation setups.</description>

      <title>Scalable Synthesis of Formally Verified Neural Value Function for Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis provides a formal method for guaranteeing safety in constrained control problems. It synthesizes a value function to represent a long-term safe set called feasible region. Early synthesis methods based on state space discretization cannot scale to high-dimensional problems, while recent methods that use neural networks to approximate value functions result in unverifiable feasible regions. To achieve both scalability and verifiability, we propose a framework for synthesizing verified neural value functions for HJ reachability analysis. Our framework consists of three stages: pre-training, adversarial training, and verification-guided training. We design three techniques to address three challenges to improve scalability respectively: boundary-guided backtracking (BGB) to improve counterexample search efficiency, entering state regularization (ESR) to enlarge feasible region, and activation pattern alignment (APA) to accelerate neural network verification. We also provide a neural safety certificate synthesis and verification benchmark called Cersyve-9, which includes nine commonly used safe control tasks and supplements existing neural network verification benchmarks. Our framework successfully synthesizes verified neural value functions on all tasks, and our proposed three techniques exhibit superior scalability and efficiency compared with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Full State Estimation of Continuum Robots from Tip Velocities: A Cosserat-Theoretic Boundary Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06130v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State estimation of robotic systems is essential to implementing feedback controllers, which usually provide better robustness to modeling uncertainties than open-loop controllers. However, state estimation of soft robots is very challenging because soft robots have theoretically infinite degrees of freedom while existing sensors only provide a limited number of discrete measurements. This work focuses on soft robotic manipulators, also known as continuum robots. We design an observer algorithm based on the well-known Cosserat rod theory, which models continuum robots by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) evolving in geometric Lie groups. The observer can estimate all infinite-dimensional continuum robot states, including poses, strains, and velocities, by only sensing the tip velocity of the continuum robot, and hence it is called a ``boundary'' observer. More importantly, the estimation error dynamics is formally proven to be locally input-to-state stable. The key idea is to inject sequential tip velocity measurements into the observer in a way that dissipates the energy of the estimation errors through the boundary. The distinct advantage of this PDE-based design is that it can be implemented using any existing numerical implementation for Cosserat rod models. All theoretical convergence guarantees will be preserved, regardless of the discretization method. We call this property ``one design for any discretization''. Extensive numerical studies are included and suggest that the domain of attraction is large and the observer is robust to uncertainties of tip velocity measurements and model parameters.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Wireless Communication Resource Allocation for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of novel industrial applications at the wireless edge, such as smart grids and vehicle networks, demands the advancement of cyber-physical systems. The performance of CPSs is closely linked to the last-mile wireless communication networks, which often become bottlenecks due to their inherent limited resources. Current CPS operations often treat wireless communication networks as unpredictable and uncontrollable variables, ignoring the potential adaptability of wireless networks, which results in inefficient and overly conservative CPS operations. Meanwhile, current wireless communications often focus more on throughput and other transmission-related metrics instead of CPS goals. In this study, we introduce the framework of goal-oriented wireless communication resource allocations, accounting for the semantics and significance of data for CPS operation goals. This guarantees optimal CPS performance from a cybernetic standpoint. We formulate a bandwidth allocation problem aimed at maximizing the information utility gain of transmitted data brought to CPS operation goals. Since the goal-oriented bandwidth allocation problem is a large-scale combinational problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer and greedy solution algorithm. The information utility gain is first approximately decomposed into marginal utility information gains and computed in a parallel manner. Subsequently, the bandwidth allocation problem is reformulated as a knapsack problem, which can be further solved greedily with a guaranteed sub-optimality gap. We further demonstrate how our proposed goal-oriented bandwidth allocation algorithm can be applied in four potential CPS applications, including data-driven decision-making, edge learning, federated learning, and distributed optimization.</description>

      <title>A Balanced Positional Control Architecture for a 12-DoF Quadruped Robot through Simulation-validation and Hardware Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06365v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multi-joint enabled robot requires extensive mathematical calculations to determine the end effector's position with respect to the other connective joints involved and their corresponding frames in a specific coordinate system. If a control architecture employs fewer positional constraints which cannot precisely determine the end effector's position in all quadrants of a 2D Cartesian plane then the robot is generally under-constrained, leading to challenges in accurate positioning to the end-effector across the entire plane. Consequently, only a subset of the end effector's degree of freedom (DoF) can be assigned for the robot's leg position for pose and trajectory estimation purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach and proposes an algorithm to consider a balanced control of the robot's leg position in a coordinate system so the robot's leg can be precisely determined and the DoF is not limited. Mathematical derivation of the joint angles is derived with forward and inverse kinematics, and Python-based simulation has been done to verify and simulate the robot's locomotion. Using Python-based code for serial communication with a micro-controller unit makes this approach more effective for demonstrating its application on a prototype leg its movement has been realized. The experimental prototype leg exhibits a commendable 78.9% accuracy with the simulated result, validating the robustness of our algorithm in practical scenarios. A comprehensive assessment of the control algorithm with random and continuous data point test has been conducted to ensure performance, so the algorithm can as well be deployed in a physical robot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vector autoregression (VAR) has been widely used in system identification, econometrics, natural science, and many other areas. However, when the state dimension becomes large the parameter dimension explodes. So rank reduced modelling is attractive and is well developed. But a fundamental requirement in almost all applications is stability of the fitted model. And this has not been addressed in the rank reduced case. Here, we develop, for the first time, a closed-form formula for an estimator of a rank reduced transition matrix which is guaranteed to be stable. We show that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically statistically efficient and illustrate it in comparative simulations.</description>

      <title>Slice-aware Resource Allocation and Admission Control for Smart Factory Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 5th generation (5G) and beyond network offers substantial promise as the ideal wireless technology to replace the existing inflexible wired connections in traditional factories of today. 5G network slicing allows for tailored allocation of resources to different network services, each with unique Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This paper presents a novel solution for slice-aware radio resource allocation based on a convex optimisation and control framework for applications in smart factory wireless networks. The proposed framework dynamically allocates minimum power and sub-channels to downlink mixed service type industrial users categorised into three slices: Capacity Limited (CL), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Time Sensitive (TS) slices. Given that the base station (BS) has limited transmission power, we enforce admission control by effectively relaxing the target rate constraints for current connections in the CL slice. This rate readjustment occurs whenever power consumption exceeds manageable levels. Simulation results show that our approach minimises power, allocates sub-channels to users, maintains slice isolation, and delivers QoS-specific communications to users in all the slices despite time-varying number of users and changing network conditions.</description>

      <title>Quaternion-based Adaptive Backstepping Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control for Quadrotor UAVs with Finite Time Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel quaternion-based approach for tracking the translation (position and linear velocity) and rotation (attitude and angular velocity) trajectories of underactuated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Quadrotor UAVs are challenging regarding accuracy, singularity, and uncertainties issues. Controllers designed based on unit-quaternion are singularity-free for attitude representation compared to other methods (e.g., Euler angles), which fail to represent the vehicle's attitude at multiple orientations. Quaternion-based Adaptive Backstepping Control (ABC) and Adaptive Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control (AFTSMC) are proposed to address a set of challenging problems. A quaternion-based ABC, a superior recursive approach, is proposed to generate the necessary thrust handling unknown uncertainties and UAV translation trajectory tracking. Next, a quaternion-based AFTSMC is developed to overcome parametric uncertainties, avoid singularity, and ensure fast convergence in a finite time. Moreover, the proposed AFTSMC is able to significantly minimize control signal chattering, which is the main reason for actuator failure and provide smooth and accurate rotational control input. To ensure the robustness of the proposed approach, the designed control algorithms have been validated considering unknown time-variant parametric uncertainties and significant initialization errors. The proposed techniques has been compared to state-of-the-art control technique.
