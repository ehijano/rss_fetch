      <title>Dynamic 3D Convex Hulls Revisited and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chan [JACM, 2010] gave a data structure for maintaining the convex hull of a dynamic set of 3D points under insertions and deletions, supporting extreme-point queries. Subsequent refinements by Kaplan, Mulzer, Roditty, Seiferth, and Sharir [DCG, 2020] and Chan [DCG, 2020] preserved the framework while improving bounds. The current best result achieves $O(\log^2 n)$ amortized insertion time, $O(\log^4 n)$ amortized deletion time, and $O(\log^2 n)$ worst-case query time. These techniques also yield dynamic 2D Euclidean nearest neighbor searching via duality, where the problem becomes maintaining the lower envelope of 3D planes for vertical ray-shooting queries. Using randomized vertical shallow cuttings, Kaplan et al. [DCG, 2020] and Liu [SICOMP, 2022] extended the framework to dynamic lower envelopes of general 3D surfaces, obtaining the same asymptotic bounds and enabling nearest neighbor searching under general distance functions. We revisit Chan's framework and present a modified structure that reduces the deletion time to $O(\log^3 n \log\log n)$, while retaining $O(\log^2 n)$ amortized insertion time, at the cost of increasing the query time to $O(\log^3 n / \log\log n)$. When the overall complexity is dominated by deletions, this yields an improvement of roughly a logarithmic factor over previous results.</description>

      <title>On Voronoi diagrams in the Funk Conical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forward and reverse Funk weak metrics are fundamental distance functions on convex bodies that serve as the building blocks for the Hilbert and Thompson metrics. In this paper we study Voronoi diagrams under the forward and reverse Funk metrics in polygonal and elliptical cones. We establish several key geometric properties: (1) bisectors consist of a set of rays emanating from the apex of the cone, and (2) Voronoi diagrams in the $d$-dimensional forward (or reverse) Funk metrics are equivalent to additively-weighted Voronoi diagrams in the $(d-1)$-dimensional forward (or reverse) Funk metrics on bounded cross sections of the cone. Leveraging this, we provide an $O\big(n^{\ceil{\frac{d-1}{2}}+1}\big)$ time algorithm for creating these diagrams in $d$-dimensional elliptical cones using a transformation to and from Apollonius diagrams, and an $O(mn\log(n))$ time algorithm for 3-dimensional polygonal cones with $m$ facets via a reduction to abstract Voronoi diagrams. We also provide a complete characterization of when three sites have a circumcenter in 3-dimensional cones. This is one of the first algorithmic studies of the Funk metrics.</description>

      <title>Structured Bitmap-to-Mesh Triangulation for Geometry-Aware Discretization of Image-Derived Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a template-driven triangulation framework that embeds raster- or segmentation-derived boundaries into a regular triangular grid for stable PDE discretization on image-derived domains. Unlike constrained Delaunay triangulation (CDT), which may trigger global connectivity updates, our method retriangulates only triangles intersected by the boundary, preserves the base mesh, and supports synchronization-free parallel execution. To ensure determinism and scalability, we classify all local boundary-intersection configurations up to discrete equivalence and triangle symmetries, yielding a finite symbolic lookup table that maps each case to a conflict-free retriangulation template. We prove that the resulting mesh is closed, has bounded angles, and is compatible with cotangent-based discretizations and standard finite element methods. Experiments on elliptic and parabolic PDEs, signal interpolation, and structural metrics show fewer sliver elements, more regular triangles, and improved geometric fidelity near complex boundaries. The framework is well suited for real-time geometric analysis and physically based simulation over image-derived domains.</description>

      <title>$L_1$-distortion of Earth Mover Distances and Transportation Cost Spaces on High Dimensional Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the distortion of any embedding into $L_1$ of the transportation cost space or earth mover distance over a $d$-dimensional grid $\{1,\dots m\}^d$ is $\Omega(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices and the implicit constant is universal (in particular, independent of dimension). This lower bound matches the universal upper bound $O(\log N)$ holding for any $N$-point metric space. Our proof relies on a new Sobolev inequality for real-valued functions on the grid, based on random measures supported on dyadic cubes.</description>

      <title>Fast and simple multiplication of bounded twin-width matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental task in almost all computational fields, including machine learning and optimization, computer graphics, signal processing, and graph algorithms (static and dynamic). Twin-width is a natural complexity measure of matrices (and more general structures) that has recently emerged as a unifying concept with important algorithmic applications. While the twin-width of a matrix is invariant to re-ordering rows and columns, most of its algorithmic applications to date assume that the input is given in a certain canonical ordering that yields a bounded twin-width contraction sequence. In general, efficiently finding such a sequence -- even for an approximate twin-width value -- remains a central and elusive open question.
  In this paper we show that a binary $n \times n$ matrix of twin-width $d$ can be preprocessed in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_d(n^2)$ time, so that its product with any vector can be computed in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_d(n)$ time. Notably, the twin-width of the input matrix need not be known and no particular ordering of its rows and columns is assumed. If a canonical ordering is available, i.e., if the input matrix is $d$-twin-ordered, then the runtime of preprocessing and matrix-vector products can be further reduced to $\mathcal{O}(n^2+dn)$ and $\mathcal{O}(dn)$.
  Consequently, we can multiply two $n \times n$ matrices in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2)$ time, when at least one of the matrices consists of 0/1 entries and has bounded twin-width. The results also extend to the case of bounded twin-width matrices with adversarial corruption. Our algorithms are significantly faster and simpler than earlier methods that involved first-order model checking and required both input matrices to be $d$-twin-ordered.</description>

      <title>The Contiguous Art Gallery Problem is in {\Theta}(n log n)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a natural variant of the Art Gallery problem, known as the \emph{Contiguous Art Gallery problem} was proposed. Given a simple polygon $P$, the goal is to partition its boundary $\partial P$ into the smallest number of contiguous segments such that each segment is completely visible from some point in $P$. Unlike the classical Art Gallery problem, which is NP-hard, this variant is polynomial-time solvable. At SoCG~2025, three independent works presented algorithms for this problem, each achieving a running time of $O(k n^5 \log n)$ (or $O(n^6\log n)$), where $k$ is the size of an optimal solution. Interestingly, these results were obtained using entirely different approaches, yet all led to roughly the same asymptotic complexity, suggesting that such a running time might be inherent to the problem.
  We show that this is not the case. In the real RAM-model, the prevalent model in computational geometry, we present an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm, achieving an $O(k n^4)$ factor speed-up over the previous state-of-the-art. We also give a straightforward sorting-based lower bound by reducing from the set intersection problem. We thus show that the Contiguous Art Gallery problem is in $\Theta(n \log n)$.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology via Finite Topological Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a functorial framework for persistent homology based on finite topological spaces and their associated posets. Starting from a finite metric space, we associate a filtration of finite topologies whose structure maps are continuous identity maps. By passing functorially to posets and to order complexes, we obtain persistence modules without requiring inclusion relations between the resulting complexes. We show that standard poset-level simplifications preserve persistent invariants and establish stability of the resulting persistence diagrams under perturbations of the input metric in a basic density-based instantiation, illustrating how stability arguments arise naturally in our framework. We further introduce a concrete density-guided construction, designed to be faithful to anchor neighborhood structure at each scale, and demonstrate its practical viability through an implementation tested on real datasets.</description>
