      <title>A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano- and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple example of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Fault-Tolerant State Preparation for Near-Term Quantum Error Correction: Automatic Synthesis Using Boolean Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure resilience against the unavoidable noise in quantum computers, quantum information needs to be encoded using an error-correcting code, and circuits must have a particular structure to be fault-tolerant. Compilation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits is thus inherently different from the non-fault-tolerant case. However, automated fault-tolerant compilation methods are widely underexplored, and most known constructions are obtained manually for specific codes only. In this work, we focus on the problem of automatically synthesizing fault-tolerant circuits for the deterministic initialization of an encoded state for a broad class of quantum codes that are realizable on current and near-term hardware.
  To this end, we utilize methods based on techniques from classical circuit design, such as satisfiability solving, resulting in tools for the synthesis of (optimal) fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for near-term quantum codes. We demonstrate the correct fault-tolerant behavior of the synthesized circuits using circuit-level noise simulations. We provide all routines as open-source software as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc.</description>

      <title>Teleportation and Entanglement Swapping of Continuous Quantum Variables of Microwave Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication is needed to build powerful quantum computers and establish reliable quantum networks. At its basis lies the ability to generate and distribute entanglement to separate quantum systems, which can be used to run remote quantum operations on them or teleport quantum states from one system to another with the help of classical channels. To this end, it is useful to harness the resource of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement since it can be efficiently and unconditionally produced by squeezing light in a nonlinear medium and can be easily manipulated, distributed, and measured using standard components. While various aspects of CV-based quantum communication have been successfully demonstrated in the optical domain, some key capabilities, such as entanglement swapping, have been lacking in the microwave domain. Here, we demonstrate three key elements of CV-based microwave quantum communication, (1) a Josephson mixer operating as nondegenerate two-mode entangler with maximum measured logarithmic negativity E_N=1.5, (2) a quantum teleportation apparatus, capable of teleporting vacuum and coherent states with a maximum fidelity of 73%, which exceeds the 50% classical limit and is mainly limited by intermediate losses in the setup, and (3) an entanglement swapping system which generates entanglement between two remote noninteracting modes via entanglement swapping operations applied to input vacuum and coherent states with maximum measured logarithmic negativity E_N=0.53. Such hardware-efficient CV entanglement building blocks that are based on nondegenerate Josephson mixers could enable wide-ranging applications in modular quantum computation, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Validate Quantum State Preparation Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key steps in quantum algorithms is to prepare an initial quantum superposition state with different kinds of features. These so-called state preparation algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to develop correctly and effectively. This paper presents Pqasm: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant, allowing us to certify our Pqasm tool to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors. The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition. The reduction allows the development of an effective testing framework for testing quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer - considered to be a hard problem with no clear solution until this point. We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to test state preparation programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using Pqasm; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing Approaches to Solving the Shipment Rerouting Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a shipment rerouting problem (SRP) which generalizes many NP-hard sequencing and packing problems. A SRP's solution has ample practical applications in vehicle scheduling and transportation logistics. Given a network of hubs, a set of goods must be delivered by trucks from their source-hubs to their respective destination-hubs. The objective is to select a set of trucks and to schedule these trucks' routes so that the total cost is minimized. The problem SRP is NP-hard; only classical approximation algorithms have been known for some of its NP-hard variants. In this work, we design classical algorithms and quantum annealing algorithms for this problem with various capacitated trucks. The algorithms that we design use novel mathematical programming formulations and new insights into solving sequencing and packing problems simultaneously. Such formulations take advantage of network infrastructure, shipments, and truck capacities. We conduct extensive experiments showing that in various scenarios, the quantum annealing solver generates near-optimal or optimal solutions much faster than the classical algorithm solver.</description>

      <title>Learning to Measure Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) has attracted growing attention, prompting extensive research into quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to solve diverse and complex problems. Designing high-performance QML models demands expert-level proficiency, which remains a significant obstacle to the broader adoption of QML. A few major hurdles include crafting effective data encoding techniques and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are crucial to the performance of QML models. Additionally, the measurement phase is frequently overlooked-most current QML models rely on pre-defined measurement protocols that often fail to account for the specific problem being addressed. We introduce a novel approach that makes the observable of the quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-learnable. Our method features an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, where the parameterized observable is trained alongside the ordinary quantum circuit parameters simultaneously. Using numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method can identify observables for variational quantum circuits that lead to improved outcomes, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby boosting the overall performance of QML models.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Enhanced Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolver for General Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a promising approach for achieving quantum advantage on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, their large-scale applications are significantly hindered by optimization challenges, such as the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon, local minima, and numerous iteration demands. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion models (DMs) to address these difficulties. The DM is trained on a few data points in the Heisenberg model parameter space and then can be guided to generate high-performance parameters for parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) tasks for general Hamiltonians. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DM-parameterized VQE can explore the ground-state energies of Heisenberg models with parameters not included in the training dataset. Even when applied to previously unseen Hamiltonians, such as the Ising and Hubbard models, it can generate the appropriate initial state to achieve rapid convergence and mitigate the BP and local minima problems. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method in improving optimization efficiency for general Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Parameter Estimation via Dynamical Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum theory, the inescapable interaction between a system and its surroundings would lead to a loss of coherence and leakage of information into the environment. An effective approach to retain the quantum characteristics of the system is to decouple it from the environment. However, things get complicated in quantum parameter estimation tasks, especially when the unknown parameter originates from the environment. Here, we propose a general dynamical modulation scheme that enables the enhancement of estimation precision irrespective of the origin of the parameters to be estimated. Notably, beyond the capability of dynamically decoupling the system from the environment, our proposal can select the effective frequency of the system and in turn manipulate the dynamics of the system, such as the steady-state probability and the decay rate, which are sensitive to the bath parameter. Therefore, the quantum Fisher information is dramatically increased, leading to superior estimation precision. Specifically, we elucidate the effectiveness of our proposal with prototypical examples of the Ramsey spectroscopy and quantum thermometer. Our findings offer an alternative route to enhance the precision of quantum estimation processes and may have potential applications in diverse branches of quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Myths around quantum computation before full fault tolerance: What no-go theorems rule out and what they don't</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this perspective article, we revisit and critically evaluate prevailing viewpoints on the capabilities and limitations of near-term quantum computing and its potential transition toward fully fault-tolerant quantum computing. We examine theoretical no-go results and their implications, addressing misconceptions about the practicality of quantum error mitigation techniques and variational quantum algorithms. By emphasizing the nuances of error scaling, circuit depth, and algorithmic feasibility, we highlight viable near-term applications and synergies between error mitigation and early fault-tolerant architectures. Our discussion explores strategies for addressing current challenges, such as barren plateaus in variational circuits and the integration of quantum error mitigation and quantum error correction techniques. We aim to underscore the importance of continued innovation in hardware and algorithmic design to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical utility, paving the way for meaningful quantum advantage in the era of late noisy intermediate scale and early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>The Extended Uncertainty Principle from an Operational Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the traditional inequalities of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) from the perspective of operational quantum mechanics. Instead of relying on purely wavefunction-based measures (e.g. the standard deviation $\sigma_x$), we introduce a apparatus-centred definition of positional uncertainty, such as a finite slit width $\Delta x$ or a spherical region of radius $R$. This choice anchors the theory directly in realistic measurement protocols and avoids ambiguities arising from wavefunction tails or boundary conditions. Using hermitian EUP momentum operators, we establish a rigorous new lower bound on the uncertainty product $\sigma_p \Delta x$. In particular, our first theorem shows that $\sigma_p \Delta x \ge \pi \hbar\,\Phi_\alpha(\Delta x/2)$, where $\Phi_\alpha(\cdot)$ encodes EUP corrections via the real parameter $\alpha \ge 0$. In the limit $\alpha \to 0$ one recovers the canonical momentum operator and the ordinary quantum mechanical inequality $\sigma_p \Delta x \ge \pi \hbar$. Extending these ideas to three (and $d$) dimensions, we also derive an analogous lower bound for systems confined in higher-dimensional spherical regions of radius $R$.</description>

      <title>Witnessing non-stationary and non-Markovian environments with a quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors offer exceptional sensitivity to nanoscale magnetic field fluctuations, where non-stationary effects such as spin diffusion and non-Markovian dynamics arising from coupling to few environmental degrees of freedom play critical roles. Here, we demonstrate how quantum sensors can characterize the statistical properties of noise sources, distinguishing between stationary and non-stationary behaviors, as well as Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a platform, we develop a physical noise model that analytically predicts Ramsey decay curves under different noise regimes. These predictions are experimentally validated by measuring Ramsey decay for NV centers subject to injected noise of each type. Our results showcase the capability of quantum sensors to unravel complex noise behaviors induced by nanoscale environments, shedding light on their physical origins and guiding the development of strategies to mitigate decoherence. This work deepens our understanding of noise dynamics at the nanoscale and lays the foundation for enhancing the performance and robustness of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Satellite-based communication for phase-matching measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of the phase-matching measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (PM-MDI QKD) protocol proposed by Lin and L\"utkenhaus for satellite-based quantum communication. The protocol's key rate, known to exceed the repeaterless bound, is evaluated in the asymptotic limit under noisy conditions typical of satellite communications, including loss-only scenarios. The setup involves two ground-based parties connected via fiber (lossonly or noisy) and a space-based third party linked to one of these two ground-based parties through free-space communication. Simulations using the elliptic-beam approximation model the average key rate (AKR) and its probability distribution (PDR) across varying zenith angles and fiber distances. Down-link free-space communication is assessed under day and night conditions, with intensity optimization for each graphical point. Dynamic configurations of satellite and ground stations are also considered. Results indicate that AKR decays more slowly under loss-only conditions, while PDR analysis shows higher key rates produce more concentrated distributions. These findings demonstrate the potential of PM-MDI QKD protocols for achieving reliable key rates in satellitebased quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Modified Conjugate Quantum Natural Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient optimization of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is critical for their successful application in quantum computing. The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method, which leverages the geometry of quantum state space, has demonstrated improved convergence compared to standard gradient descent [Quantum 4, 269 (2020)]. In this work, we introduce the Modified Conjugate Quantum Natural Gradient (CQNG), an optimization algorithm that integrates QNG with principles from the nonlinear conjugate gradient method. Unlike QNG, which employs a fixed learning rate, CQNG dynamically adjusts hyperparameters at each step, enhancing both efficiency and flexibility. Numerical simulations show that CQNG achieves faster convergence than QNG across various optimization scenarios, even when strict conjugacy conditions are not always satisfied -- hence the term ``Modified Conjugate.'' These results highlight CQNG as a promising optimization technique for improving the performance of VQAs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Nonreversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms can potentially solve a handful of problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts. In that context, it has been discussed that Markov chains problems could be solved significantly faster using quantum computing. Indeed, previous work suggests that quantum computers could accelerate sampling from the stationary distribution of reversible Markov chains. However, in practice, certain physical processes of interest are nonreversible in the probabilistic sense and reversible Markov chains can sometimes be replaced by more efficient nonreversible chains targeting the same stationary distribution. This study uses modern quantum algorithmic techniques and Markov chain theory to sample from the stationary distribution of nonreversible Markov chains with faster worst-case runtime and without requiring the stationary distribution to be computed up to a multiplicative constant. Such an up-to-exponential quantum speedup goes beyond the predicted quadratic quantum acceleration for reversible chains and is likely to have a decisive impact on many applications ranging from statistics and machine learning to computational modeling in physics, chemistry, biology and finance.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional quantum key distribution rates for multiple measurement bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the advantages of high-dimensional encoding for a quantum key distribution protocol. In particular, we address a BBM92-like protocol where the dimension of the systems can be larger than two and more than two mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) can be employed. Indeed, it is known that, for a system whose dimension $d$ is a prime or the power of a prime, up to $d+1$ MUBs can be found. We derive an analytic expression for the asymptotic key rate when $d+1$ MUBs are exploited and show the effects of using different numbers of MUBs on the performance of the protocol. Then, we move to the non-asymptotic case and optimize the finite key rate against collective and coherent attacks for generic dimension of the systems and all possible numbers of MUBs. In the finite-key scenario, we find that, if the number of rounds is small enough, the highest key rate is obtained by exploiting three MUBs, instead of $d+1$ as one may expect.</description>

      <title>Strain-enabled control of the vanadium qudit in silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium in silicon carbide is a promising spin photon interface candidate with optical transitions in the telecom range and a long lived electron spin, hosted in an advanced semiconductor platform. In this detailed investigation of the defect's 16-dimensional ground state spin manifold at millikelvin temperatures, a wide range of previously unreported transitions are observed which are accurately described using a theoretical model that includes strain. Using a superconducting microcoil we achieve Rabi frequencies exceeding 20 MHz and perform the first coherent manipulation of a direct hyperfine transition. These insights further underscore the defect's potential for strain engineering and sensing, as well as for fault-tolerant qudit encoding.</description>

      <title>Q-MAML: Quantum Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to solve optimization problems has become a key application. However, these algorithms face significant challenges, such as choosing an effective initial set of parameters and the limited quantum processing time that restricts the number of optimization iterations. In this study, we introduce a new framework for optimizing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) that employs a classical optimizer, inspired by Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) technique. This approach aim to achieve better parameter initialization that ensures fast convergence. Our framework features a classical neural network, called Learner}, which interacts with a PQC using the output of Learner as an initial parameter. During the pre-training phase, Learner is trained with a meta-objective based on the quantum circuit cost function. In the adaptation phase, the framework requires only a few PQC updates to converge to a more accurate value, while the learner remains unchanged. This method is highly adaptable and is effectively extended to various Hamiltonian optimization problems. We validate our approach through experiments, including distribution function mapping and optimization of the Heisenberg XYZ Hamiltonian. The result implies that the Learner successfully estimates initial parameters that generalize across the problem space, enabling fast adaptation.</description>

      <title>Witnessing global memory effects of multiqubit correlated noisy channels by Hilbert-Schmidt speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In correlated noisy channels, the global memory effects on the dynamics of a quantum system depend on both non-Markovianity of the single noisy channel (intrinsic memory) and classical correlations between multiple uses of the channel itself (correlation-based memory). We show that the Hilbert-Schmidt speed (HSS), a measure of non-Markovianity, serves as a reliable figure of merit for evaluating the role of this correlation-based memory on the global memory effects, for both unital and non-unital channels. The intensity of the correlation-based memory is ruled by a classical correlation strength between consecutive applications of the channel. We demonstrate that, for unital noisy channels, increasing the number of qubits of the system significantly weakens the sensitivity of the HSS to this classical correlation strength. Such a pattern indicates that the state evolution of large quantum systems may be less prone to be affected by classical correlations between noisy channels. Moreover, assuming the qubits are affected by independent or classically correlated local non-Markovian unital channels, we observe that, as the number of qubits increases, the collective behavior of the multiqubit system inhibits the non-Markovian features of the overall system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of parity-symmetry-protected phenomena in the quantum Rabi model with a trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is crucial for gaining insights into the fundamental properties of physical systems, bringing possibilities in studying exotic phenomena such as quantum phase transitions and ground state entanglement. Here, we experimentally simulate a highly controllable extended quantum Rabi model, capable of tuning into the ultra-strong or deep coupling regime, in a spin-motion-coupled trapped ion. We observe that the phonon driven by such a model with parity symmetry preserved (broken) would experience double (single) excitation in the ultra-strong coupling regime. Quantum phenomena such as strong ground state entanglement and quantum superposition in systems occur with parity symmetry, and these phenomena disappear following the symmetry breaking. We also find sensitive responses for the two-level system entropy and phonon Wigner function in the deep coupling regime, depending on the parameter across the symmetry transition point. This work offers the prospect of exploring symmetry-controlled quantum phenomena and their applications in high-precision quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>SimOS: A Python Framework for Simulations of Optically Addressable Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source simulation framework for optically detected magnetic resonance, developed in Python. The framework allows users to construct, manipulate, and evolve multipartite quantum systems that consist of spins and electronic levels. We provide an interface for efficient time-evolution in Lindblad form as well as a framework for facilitating simulation of spatial and generalized stochastic dynamics. Further, symbolic operator construction and propagation is supported for simple model systems making the framework also ideal for use in classroom instruction of magnetic resonance. Designed to be backend-agnostic, the library leverages existing Python libraries as computational backends. We introduce the most important functionality and illustrate the syntax on a series of examples. These include systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and photo-generated spin-correlated radical pairs for which our library offers system-specific sub-modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central challenges for a practical fault-tolerant quantum computer is scalability. A three-dimensional structure of optical tweezer arrays offers the potential for scaling up neutral atom processors. However, coherent local operations, essential for quantum error correction, have yet to be explored for this platform. Here, we demonstrate plane-by-plane initialization of nuclear spin qubits of ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ atoms in a three-dimensional atom array and execute local coherent qubit rotations that act only on specific planes, by exploiting the plane-selective excitation of the atoms from the ${}^1S_0$ to the ${}^3P_2$ state. This plane-selective manipulation technique paves the way for quantum computing and quantum simulation in three-dimensional multilayer architectures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transition in a cluster spin chain coupled with free spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Dissipating quartets of excitations in a superconducting circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, autonomous stabilization of bosonic qubits has emerged as a promising approach for hardware-efficient protection of quantum information. However, applying these techniques to more complex encodings than the Schr\"odinger cat code requires exquisite control of high-order wave mixing processes. The challenge is to enable specific multiphotonic dissipation channels while avoiding unintended non-linear interactions. In this work, we leverage a genuine six-wave mixing process enabled by a near Kerr-free Josephson element to enforce dissipation of quartets of excitations in a high-impedance superconducting resonator. Owing to residual non-linearities stemming from stray inductances in our circuit, this dissipation channel is only effective when the resonator holds a specific number of photons. Applying it to the fourth excited state of the resonator, we show an order of magnitude enhancement of the state decay rate while only marginally impacting the relaxation and coherence of lower energy states. Given that stray inductances could be strongly reduced through simple modifications in circuit design and that our methods can be adapted to activate even higher-order dissipation channels, these results pave the way toward the dynamical stabilization of four-component Schr\"odinger cat qubits and even more complex bosonic qubits.</description>

      <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to QSP pre-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) relies on a historically costly pre-processing step, "QSP-processing/phase-factor finding." QSP-processing is now a developed topic within quantum algorithms literature, and a beginner accessible review of QSP-processing is overdue. This work provides a whirlwind tour through QSP conventions and pre-processing methods, beginning from a pedagogically accessible QSP convention. We then review QSP conventions associated with three common polynomial types: real polynomials with definite parity, sums of reciprocal/anti-reciprocal Chebyshev polynomials, and complex polynomials. We demonstrate how the conventions perform with respect to three criteria: circuit length, polynomial conditions, and pre-processing methods.
  We then review the recently introduced Wilson method for QSP-processing and give conditions where it can succeed with bound error. Although the resulting bound is not computationally efficient, we demonstrate that the method succeeds with linear error propagation for relevant target polynomials and precision regimes, including the Jacobi-Anger expansion used in Hamiltonian simulation algorithms. We then apply our benchmarks to three QSP-processing methods for QSP circuits and show that a method introduced by Berntson and S\"underhauf outperforms both the Wilson method and the standard optimization strategy for complex polynomials.</description>

      <title>Free temporal evolution of a superbandwidth wave packet: The quantum tale of the hare and the tortoise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can the interplay between quantum mechanics and classical optics offer new perspectives on wavepacket dynamics? Building on this connection, we show that local momenta with both super-oscillatory and suboscillatory characteristics can arise during the free propagation of a quantum particle. This behavior is mathematically analogous to the propagation of a superbandwidth laser pulse in a dispersive medium, where the instantaneous frequencies of the electric field exhibit similar sub- and super-oscillatory features. This analogy is rooted in the equivalence between the wave description of light in classical optics and the formalism of quantum mechanics. In addition, we explore the phenomenon of wavepacket localization during free propagation within a bounded region. This localization is directly linked to the distribution of local momenta within the confined wavepacket region. To complement our quantum mechanical analysis, we also perform a classical analysis to provide further insights into this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that both the emergence of local momenta with sub- and super-oscillatory features and the wavepacket localization occur within a distinct timescale, which we define as the interference time.</description>

Abstract: We simulate the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using the Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on a neutral atom quantum computer. We test the ground-state energy of spin systems with up to 15 spins. Two different encoding schemes are used: an individual spin encoding where each spin is represented by one qubit, and an efficient Gray code encoding scheme which only requires a number of qubits that scales with the logarithm of the number of spins. This more efficient encoding, together with zero noise extrapolation techniques, is shown to improve the fidelity of the simulated energies with respect to exact solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating large-scale coupled-oscillator systems presents substantial computational challenges for classical algorithms, particularly when pursuing first-principles analyses in the thermodynamic limit. Motivated by the quantum algorithm framework proposed by Babbush et al., we present and implement a detailed quantum circuit construction for simulating one-dimensional spring-mass systems. Our approach incorporates key quantum subroutines, including block encoding, quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), and amplitude amplification, to realize the unitary time-evolution operator associated with simulating classical oscillators dynamics. In the uniform spring-mass setting, our circuit construction requires a gate complexity of $\mathcal{O}\bigl(\log_2^2 N\,\log_2(1/\varepsilon)\bigr)$, where $N$ is the number of oscillators and $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy of the approximation. For more general, heterogeneous spring-mass systems, the total gate complexity is $\mathcal{O}\bigl(N\log_2 N\,\log_2(1/\varepsilon)\bigr)$. Both settings require $\mathcal{O}(\log_2 N)$ qubits. Numerical simulations agree with classical solvers across all tested configurations, indicating that this circuit-based Hamiltonian simulation approach can substantially reduce computational costs and potentially enable larger-scale many-body studies on future quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general non-perturbative method to determine the exact perturbed steady state of open quantum systems, in terms of the eigenmodes of the unperturbed system. The perturbation may be time-independent or periodic, and of arbitrarily large amplitude. Using a generalized inverse and two diagonalizations, we construct an operator that generates the entire dependence of the steady state on the perturbation parameter. The approach also enables exact analytic operations-such as differentiation, integration, and ensemble averaging-with respect to the parameter, even when the steady state is computed numerically. We apply the method to three non-trivial open quantum systems, showing that it achieves exact results, with a computational speedup for calculations requiring large sampling, such as ensemble averaging, compared to sampling-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Hidden entanglement in twin beams generated through optical parametric amplification in hot alkali atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper characterization of quantum correlations in a multimode optical state is critical for applications in quantum information science; however, the most common entanglement measurements can lead to an incomplete state reconstruction. This is the case for the ubiquitous spectral measurement of field quadratures for which a full characterization of the quantum correlations between optical beams is not possible. We demonstrate this effect in twin beams generated through parametric amplification by four-wave mixing in hot rubidium vapor, showing the role of a frequency dependent gain response. We implement a resonator-based measurement that reveals entanglement between beams that is otherwise hidden by usual spectral measurements. Additionally, this system shows how the phase shifts between the carrier and the sidebands on the involved fields affect the observation of entanglement for different entanglement witnesses, demonstrating the relevance of making a complete state tomography.</description>

      <title>Supercharging Single-Atom Traps by Collisional Blockade</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of trapped single atoms are an excellent platform for the simulation of many-body physics and the realisation of high-fidelity quantum gates. The confinement of atoms is often achieved with focussed laser beams acting as optical dipole-force traps that allow for both static and dynamic positioning of atoms. In these traps, light-assisted collisions -- enhancing the two-atom loss rate -- ensure that single atom occupation of traps can be realised. However, the time-averaged probability of trapping a single atom is limited to $0.5$ when loading directly from a surrounding cloud of laser-cooled atoms, preventing deterministic filling of large arrays. In this work, we demonstrate that increasing the depth of a static, optical dipole trap enables the transition from fast loading on a timescale of $2.1\,$s to an extended trap lifetime of $7.9\,$s. This method demonstrates an achievable filling ratio of $(79\pm2)\,\%$ without the need of rearranging atoms to fill vacant traps.</description>

      <title>Faster quantum chemistry simulations on a quantum computer with improved tensor factorization and active volume compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations of molecular systems are among the most promising applications for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) in quantum chemistry and drug design. However, while recent algorithmic advancements such as qubitization and Tensor Hypercontraction (THC) have significantly reduced the complexity of such calculations, they do not yet achieve computational runtimes short enough to be practical for industrially relevant use cases. In this work, we introduce several advances to electronic structure calculation for molecular systems, resulting in a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup of estimated runtimes over prior-art algorithms run on comparable quantum devices. One of these advances is a novel framework for block-invariant symmetry-shifted Tensor Hypercontraction (BLISS-THC), with which we achieve the tightest Hamiltonian factorizations reported to date. We compile our algorithm for an Active Volume (AV) architecture, a technical layout that has recently been proposed for fusion-based photonic quantum hardware. AV compilation contributes towards a lower runtime of our computation by eliminating overheads stemming from connectivity issues in the underlying surface code. We present a detailed benchmark of our approach, focusing primarily on the computationally challenging benchmark molecule P450. Leveraging a number of hardware tradeoffs in interleaving-based photonic FTQC, we estimate runtimes for the electronic structure calculation of P450 as a function of the device footprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of non-Markovian classical noise on single-qubit randomized benchmarking experiments, in a manner that explicitly models the realization of each gate via realistic finite-duration pulses. Our new framework exploits the random nature of each gate sequence to derive expressions for the full survival probability decay curve which are non-perturbative in the noise strength. In the presence of non-Markovian noise, our approach shows that the decay curve can exhibit a strong dependence on the implementation method, with regimes of both exponential and power law decays. We discuss how these effects can complicate the interpretation of a randomized-benchmarking experiment, but also how to leverage them to probe non-Markovianty.</description>

      <title>Measuring Non-Gaussian Magic in Fermions: Convolution, Entropy, and the Violation of Wick's Theorem and the Matchgate Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically hard to simulate quantum states, or "magic states", are prerequisites to quantum advantage, highlighting an apparent separation between classically and quantumly tractable problems. Classically simulable states such as Clifford circuits on stabilizer states, free bosonic states, free fermions, and matchgate circuits are all in some sense Gaussian. While free bosons and fermions arise from quadratic Hamiltonians, recent works have demonstrated that bosonic and qudit systems converge to Gaussians and stabilizers under convolution. In this work, we similarly identify convolution for fermions and find efficient measures of non-Gaussian magic in pure fermionic states. We demonstrate that three natural notions for the Gaussification of a state, (1) the Gaussian state with the same covariance matrix, (2) the fixed point of convolution, and (3) the closest Gaussian in relative entropy, coincide by proving a central limit theorem for fermionic systems. We then utilize the violation of Wick's theorem and the matchgate identity to quantify non-Gaussian magic in addition to a SWAP test.</description>

      <title>Algebraic solutions for $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems: generic statistical ensembles and a mesoscopic system application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solutions of generic $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems are obtained through systematic manipulations of quartic polynomial equations. An {\em ansatz} for constructing separable and entangled eigenstate basis, depending on the quartic equation coefficients, is proposed. Besides the quantum concurrence for pure entangled states, the associated thermodynamic statistical ensembles, their partition function, quantum purity and quantum concurrence are shown to be straightforwardly obtained. Results are specialized to a $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ structure emulated by lattice-layer degrees of freedom of the Bernal stacked graphene, in a context that can be extended to several mesoscopic scale systems for which the onset from $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonians has been assumed.</description>

      <title>Skein Construction of Balanced Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of tensor categories has found applications across various fields, including representation theory, quantum field theory (conformal in 2 dimensions, and topological in 3 and 4 dimensions), quantum invariants of low-dimensional objects, topological phases of matter, and topological quantum computation. In essence, it is a categorification of the classical theory of algebras and modules. In this analogy, the Deligne tensor product $\boxtimes$ is to the linear tensor $\otimes_{\mathbb{C}}$ as the balanced tensor product $\boxtimes_C$ is to the tensor over algebra $\otimes_A$, where $\mathbb{C}$ is a field, $A$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, and $C$ is a tensor category.
  Before this work, several algebraic constructions for balanced tensor products were known, including categories of modules, internal Hom spaces, and generalized categorical centers. In this paper, we introduce a topological construction based on skein theory that offers a better mix of algebra and topology. This approach not only works for products of multiple module categories, but also provides the missing key to proving that the Turaev-Viro state sum model naturally arises from the 3-functor in the classification of fully extended field theories. Building on this result, we establish this long-anticipated proof in an upcoming work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two complex SYK models entangled in a thermofield double (TFD) state and investigate the effect of one-sided projective measurements. As measurement operator we choose single site charge operators. Performing a measurement results in a non-zero $U(1)$ charge. The entropy curve differs from the previously studied SYK model due to a thermodynamic phase transition that takes place after a certain charge is reached. We also match our results to a dual bulk description. Finally, a teleportation protocol is provided to support the notion of a traversable wormhole being formed.</description>

Abstract: Single-time and two-time correlators are computed exactly in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model after a quench to zero temperature and on a periodic chain of finite length $N$, using a simple analytical continuation technique. Besides the general confirmation of finite-size scaling in non-equilibrium dynamics, this allows to test the scaling behaviour of the plateau height $C_{\infty}^{(2)}$ to which the two-time auto-correlator converges, when deep into the finite-size regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a compound sample consisting from a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) system non-linearly coupled with a leaking single-mode micro-resonator is theoretically investigated. The focus is on the resonance condition when the transition frequency of the double quantum dot equals to the doubled resonator frequency, respectively, and the resulting interplay among the involved phonon or photon channels. As a result, the steady-state quantum dynamics of this complex non-linear system exhibits a variety of possible effects that have been demonstrated here. Particularly, we have found the relationship among the electrical current through the double quantum dot and the microwave field inside the resonator that is nonlinearly coupled to it, with a corresponding emphasizing on their critical behaviors. Additionally, the quantum correlations of the photon flux generated into the resonator mode vary from super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics, leading to single-qubit lasing phenomena at microwave frequencies.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a systematic analysis of cavity effects on the decay dynamics of an open magnonic system. The Purcell effect on the magnon oscillator decay is thoroughly examined for both driven and non-driven scenarios. Analytical conditions are determined to distinguish between strong and weak coupling regimes, corresponding to oscillatory and pure decay behaviors respectively. Additionally, our theory also predicts the decay of the photon mode within the cavity-magnonic open system, demonstrating excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Our findings and methodologies can provide valuable insights for advancing research in cavity magnonic quantum control, quantum information processing, and the development of magnonic quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the surface paradox: Buried perovskite quantum dots in wide-bandgap perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are an exciting platform for on-demand quantum, and classical optoelectronic and photonic devices. However, their potential success is limited by the extreme sensitivity and low stability arising from their weak intrinsic lattice bond energy and complex surface chemistry. Here we report a novel platform of buried perovskite quantum dots (b-PQDs) in a three-dimensional perovskite thin-film, fabricated using one-step, flash annealing, which overcomes surface related instabilities in colloidal perovskite dots. The b-PQDs demonstrate ultrabright and stable single-dot emission, with resolution-limited linewidths below 130 {\mu}eV, photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.1), no blinking, suppressed spectral diffusion, and high photon count rates of 10^4/s, consistent with unity quantum yield. The ultrasharp linewidth resolves exciton fine-structures (dark and triplet excitons) and their dynamics under a magnetic field. Additionally, b-PQDs can be electrically driven to emit single photons with 1 meV linewidth and photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.4). These results pave the way for on-chip, low-cost single-photon sources for next generation quantum optical communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Avalanches in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-preserving Interacting Ising Majorana Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical works have revealed the instability of many-body localized (MBL) phase in disordered quantum many-body systems with finite system sizes and over finite timescales. This instability arises from Griffith regions that occur at the thermodynamic limit, which rapidly thermalize and affect the surrounding typical MBL regions, introducing an avalanche mechanism into the system. Here, we consider the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-preserving interacting Ising Majorana chain model, which exhibits a more complex phase diagram, where an ergodic phase emerges between two MBL phases with different long-range order properties. We calculate the dynamic characteristics of the model when coupled to an infinite bath under perturbation, and through scaling behavior of the slowest thermalization rate, we find how critical disorder strengths in finite-size systems are affected by the avalanche mechanism. We also employe the embedded inclusion model and use the time evolution of mutual information between each spin and the artificial Griffith region to probe the diffusion of the thermal bubble. We observe that in finite-sized systems, the critical disorder strength gradually drifts away from the central. Our work demonstrate that both MBL paramagnetic phase and MBL spin-glass phase are unstable at finite sizes.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum statistical mechanics of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In contrast, the quantum theory of many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. We relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum RP resonances converge inside the unit disk. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions. Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We identify the exact RP resonances in the RPM and prove that the same RP resonances are obtained from operator truncation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance. Finally, we demonstrate how conservation laws, many-body localization, and nonlocal interactions merge the leading RP resonance into the unit circle, thereby suppressing anomalous relaxation.</description>

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is one of the main techniques employed in artificial intelligence. We introduce an algorithm for quantum-assisted unsupervised data clustering using the self-organizing feature map, a type of artificial neural network. The complexity of our algorithm scales as O(LN), in comparison to the classical case which scales as O(LMN), where N is the number of samples, M is the number of randomly sampled cluster vectors, and L is the number of the shifts of cluster vectors. We perform a proof-of-concept demonstration of one of the central components on the IBM quantum computer and show that it allows us to reduce the number of calculations in the number of clusters. Our algorithm exhibits exponential decrease in the errors of the distance matrix with the number of runs of the algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of the individuality interpretation of quantum theory (QT), the basic equations of QT cannot be derived from the basic equations of classical mechanics (CM). The unbridgeable gap between CM and QT is given by the fact that a certain system which is described in CM by a finite number of degrees of freedom requires an infinite number in QT. The standard quantization method, which is conceptually closely linked to the individuality interpretation, is limited to finding structural similarities between observables and operators. The fundamental question \emph{why} one must move from a finite number to an infinite number of degrees of freedom, remains unanswered. This gap can only be closed if probabilistic aspects are already taken into account in the classical area. This may be done by taking the uncertainty in initial conditions into account. In this probabilistic version of mechanics (PM), a system is mathematically described as an ensemble, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, thus bridging the gap mentioned above. This step then enables the reconstruction of QT, in particular the derivation of the Schr\"odinger equation, from PM. This work is the third in a series of works in which this program is carried out. The method used here differs from the previous one and allows a better understanding of the structural differences between classical physics and QT. The derivation of the Schr\"odinger equation essentially takes place in two steps: a projection from phase space to configuration space and a linearization. Some contradictions of the individuality interpretation are analyzed and eliminated from the point of view of the ensemble interpretation.</description>

      <title>Selection and improvement of product formulae for best performance of quantum simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulation of Hamiltonian evolution are often based on product formulae. The fractal methods give a systematic way to find arbitrarily high-order product formulae, but result in a large number of exponentials. On the other hand, product formulae with fewer exponentials can be found by numerical solution of simultaneous nonlinear equations. It is also possible to reduce the cost of long-time simulations by processing, where a kernel is repeated and a processor need only be applied at the beginning and end of the simulation. In this work, we found thousands of new product formulae, and numerically tested these formulae, together with many formulae from prior literature. We provide methods to fairly compare product formulae of different lengths and different orders. For the case of 8th order, we have found new product formulae with exceptional performance, about two orders of magnitude better accuracy than prior work, both in the processed and non-processed cases. The processed product formula provides the best performance due to being shorter than the non-processed product formula. It outperforms all other tested product formulae over a range of many orders of magnitude in system parameters $T$ (time) and $\epsilon$ (allowable error). That includes reasonable combinations of parameters to be used in quantum algorithms, where the size of the simulation is large enough to be classically intractable, but not so large it takes an impractically long time on a quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negativity in certain quasiprobability representations is a necessary condition for a quantum computational advantage. Here we define a new quasiprobability representation exhibiting this property with respect to quantum computations in the magic state model. It is based on generalized Jordan-Wigner transformations, and it has a close connection to the probability representation of universal quantum computation based on the $\Lambda$ polytopes. For each number of qubits, it defines a polytope contained in the $\Lambda$ polytope with some shared vertices. It leads to an efficient classical simulation algorithm for magic state quantum circuits for which the input state is positively represented, and it outperforms previous representations in terms of the states that can be positively represented.</description>

Abstract: For a simple quantum system weakly interacting with the environment Wigner's 1932 formulation of quantum physics can be used to derive coupling to the environment using simple algebra. We show that the correct expressions, using coupling terms of `Lindblad form', are forced upon us. This is remarkable given that it took several decades before Lindblad's result was found in 1976.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau states of electrons with orbital angular momentum in magnetic fields are important in the quantum theories of metals and of synchrotron radiation at storage rings, in relativistic astrophysics of neutron stars, and in many other areas. In realistic scenarios, electrons are often born inside the field or injected from a field-free region, requiring nonstationary quantum states to account for boundary or initial conditions. This study presents nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) states in a longitudinal magnetic field, characterizing vortex electrons after their transfer from vacuum to the field. Comparisons with Landau states and calculations of observables such as mean energy and r.m.s. radius show that the r.m.s. radius of the electron packet in the NSLG state oscillates in time around a significantly larger value than that of the Landau state. This quantum effect of oscillations is due to boundary conditions and can potentially be observed in various problems, particularly when using magnetic lenses of electron microscopes and linear accelerators. Analogies are drawn between a quantum wave packet and a classical beam of many particles in phase space, including the calculation of mean emittance of the NSLG state as a measure of their quantum nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the first quantum computing framework for Stochastic Quantum Power Flow (SQPF) analysis in power systems. The proposed method leverages quantum states to encode power flow distributions, enabling the use of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling to efficiently assess the probability of line overloads. Our approach significantly reduces the required sample size compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods, making it particularly suited for risk assessments in scenarios involving high uncertainty, such as renewable energy integration. We validate the method on two test systems, demonstrating the computational advantage of quantum algorithms in reducing sample complexity while maintaining accuracy. This work represents a foundational step toward scalable quantum power flow analysis, with potential applications in future power system operations and planning. The results show promising computational speedups, underscoring the potential of quantum computing in addressing the increasing uncertainty in modern power grids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of efficient quantum communication technologies depends on the innovation in multiple layers of its implementation, a challenge we address from the fundamental properties of the physical system at the nano-scale to the instrumentation level at the macro-scale. We select a promising near infrared quantum emitter, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in 4H-SiC, and integrate it, at an ensemble level, with nanopillar structures that enhance photon collection efficiency into an objective lens. Moreover, changes in collection efficiency in pillars compared to bulk can serve as indicators of color center orientation in the lattice. To characterize NV center properties at the unprecedented sub-2 Kelvin temperatures, we incorporate compatible superconducting nanowire single photon detectors inside the chamber of an optical cryostat and create the ICECAP, the Integrated Cryogenic system for Emission, Collection And Photon-detection. ICECAP measurements show no significant linewidth broadening of NV ensemble emission and up to 14-fold enhancement in collected emission. With additional filtering, we measure emitter lifetimes of NV centers in a basal ($hk$) and an axial ($kk$) orientation unveiling their cryogenic values of 2.2 ns and 2.8 ns.</description>

      <title>Quantum error mitigation by layerwise Richardson extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely used method for mitigating errors in noisy quantum computers is Richardson extrapolation, a technique in which the overall effect of noise on the estimation of quantum expectation values is captured by a single parameter that, after being scaled to larger values, is eventually extrapolated to the zero-noise limit. We generalize this approach by introducing \emph{layerwise Richardson extrapolation (LRE)}, an error mitigation protocol in which the noise of different individual layers (or larger chunks of the circuit) is amplified and the associated expectation values are linearly combined to estimate the zero-noise limit. The coefficients of the linear combination are analytically obtained from the theory of multivariate Lagrange interpolation. LRE leverages the flexible configurational space of layerwise unitary folding, allowing for a more nuanced mitigation of errors by treating the noise level of each layer of the quantum circuit as an independent variable. We provide numerical simulations demonstrating scenarios where LRE achieves superior performance compared to traditional (single-variable) Richardson extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Recursive Quantum Relaxation for Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimization methods use a continuous degree-of-freedom of quantum states to heuristically solve combinatorial problems, such as the MAX-CUT problem, which can be attributed to various NP-hard combinatorial problems. This paper shows that some existing quantum optimization methods can be unified into a solver to find the binary solution which is most likely measured from the optimal quantum state. Combining this finding with the concept of quantum random access codes (QRACs) for encoding bits into quantum states on fewer qubits, we propose an efficient recursive quantum relaxation method called recursive quantum random access optimization (RQRAO) for MAX-CUT. Experiments on standard benchmark graphs with several hundred nodes in the MAX-CUT problem, conducted in a fully classical manner using a tensor network technique, show that RQRAO not only outperforms the Goemans-Williamson and recursive QAOA methods, but also is comparable to state-of-the-art classical solvers. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ToyotaCRDL/rqrao}.</description>

      <title>Commitments are equivalent to statistically-verifiable one-way state generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03220v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-way state generators (OWSG) are natural quantum analogs to classical one-way functions. We consider statistically-verifiable OWSGs (sv-OWSG), which are potentially weaker objects than OWSGs. We show that O(n/log(n))-copy sv-OWSGs (n represents the input length) are equivalent to poly(n)-copy sv-OWSGs and to quantum commitments. Since known results show that o(n/log(n))-copy OWSGs cannot imply commitments, this shows that O(n/log(n))-copy sv-OWSGs are the weakest OWSGs from which we can get commitments (and hence much of quantum cryptography).
  Our construction follows along the lines of Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin and Luby, who obtained classical pseudorandom generators (PRG) from classical one-way functions (OWF), however with crucial modifications. Our construction, when applied to the classical case, provides an alternative to the classical construction to obtain a classical mildly non-uniform PRG from any classical OWF. Since we do not argue conditioned on the output $f(x)$, our construction and analysis is arguably simpler and may be of independent interest. For converting a mildly non-uniform PRG to a uniform PRG, we can use the classical construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the competition between light-mediated and intrinsic matter-matter interactions in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. For this, we couple a superconducting transmission line to a model magnetic material, made of organic free radical molecules with a spin $S=1/2$ and a $g_{S}$ factor very close to that of a free electron. The microwave transmission has been measured in a wide range of temperatures ($0.013$ K $\leq T \leq 2$ K), magnetic fields ($0\leq B \leq 0.5$ T) and frequencies ($0 \leq \omega/2 \pi \leq 14$ GHz). We find that molecules belonging to one of the two crystal sublattices form one-dimensional spin chains. Temperature then controls the intrinsic correlations along these chains in a continuous and monotonic way. In the paramagnetic region ($T &gt; 0.7$ K), the microwave transmission shows evidences for the collective coupling of quasi-identical spins to the propagating photons, with coupling strengths that reach values close to the dissipation rates. As $T$ decreases, the growth of spin correlations, combined with the anisotropy in the spin-spin exchange constants, tend to suppress the collective spin-photon coupling. In this regime, the spin visibility in transmission reflects also a gradual change in the nature of the dominant spin excitations, from single spin flips to bosonic magnons.</description>

Abstract: Even a minor boost in solving combinatorial optimization problems can greatly benefit multiple industries. Quantum computers, with their unique information processing capabilities, hold promise for delivering such enhancements. The Filtering Variational Quantum Eigensolver (F-VQE) is a variational hybrid quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems on existing quantum computers with limited qubit number, connectivity, and fidelity. In this work we employ Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial circuits as our parameterized quantum circuits. We propose a hardware-efficient implementation that respects limited qubit connectivity and show that they halve the number of circuits necessary to evaluate the gradient with the parameter-shift rule. To assess the potential of this protocol in the context of combinatorial optimization, we conduct extensive numerical analysis. We compare the performance against three classical baseline algorithms on weighted MaxCut and the Asymmetric Traveling Salesperson Problem (ATSP). We employ noiseless simulators for problems encoded on 13 to 29 qubits, and up to 37 qubits on the IBMQ real quantum devices. The ATSP encoding employed reduces the number of qubits and avoids the need of constraints compared to the standard QUBO / Ising model. Despite some observed positive signs, we conclude that significant development is necessary for a practical advantage with F-VQE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stark systems in which a linear gradient field is applied across a many-body system have recently been proposed for quantum sensing. Here, we explore sensing capacity of Stark probes, in both single-particle and many-body interacting systems, for estimating nonlinear forms of the gradient fields. Our analysis reveals that, this estimation can achieve super-Heisenberg scaling precision that grows linearly by increasing the nonlinearity. Specifically, we find a universal algebraic relation between the scaling of the precision and the degree of the nonlinearity. This universal behavior remains valid in both single-particle and many-body interacting probes and reflects itself in the properties of the phase transition from an extended to a localized phase, obtained through establishing a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. Considering a parabolic gradient potential composed of both linear and nonlinear fields, we used multi-parameter estimation methodology to estimate the components of the gradient potential. The phase diagram of the system is determined in terms of both linear and nonlinear gradient fields showing how the nonlocalized phase turns into a localized one as the Stark fields increase. The sensing precision of both linear and nonlinear Stark fields follows the same universal algebraic relation that was found for the case of single parameter sensing. We demonstrate that simple and experimentally available measurements can reach the theoretical precision bounds. Finally, we show that quantum enhanced sensitivity is still achievable even when we incorporate the preparation time of the probe into our resource analysis.</description>

      <title>Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify ($\textit{herald}$) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the validity of the equivalence principle in the quantum regime, we argue that one of the assumptions of the usual definition of quantum mechanics, namely separation between the ``classical'' detector and the ``quantum'' system, must be relaxed. We argue, therefore, that if both the equivalence principle and quantum mechanics continue to survive experimental tests, that this favors ``epistemic'' interpretations of quantum mechanics (where formalism is built around relations between observables) over ``ontic ones'' (assuming the reality of states and wavefunctions). In particular, we show that relational type interpretations can readily accomodate the equivalence principle via a minor modification of the assumptions used to justify the formalism.
  We qualitatively speculate what a full generally covariant quantum dynamics could look like, and comment on experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Coherent feedback control for cavity optomechanical systems with a frequency-dependent mirror</title>

Abstract: Ground-state cooling of mechanical resonators is a prerequisite for the observation of various quantum effects in optomechanical systems and thus has always been a crucial task in quantum optomechanics. In this paper, we study how to realize ground-state cooling of the mechanical mode in a Fano-mirror optomechanical setup, which allows for enhanced effective optomechanical interaction but typically works in the (deeply) unresolved-sideband regime. We reveal that for such a two-sided cavity geometry with very different decay rates at the two cavity mirrors, it is possible to cool the mechanical mode down to its ground state within a broad range of parameters by using an appropriate single-sided coherent feedback. This is possible even if the total optical loss is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the mechanical frequency and the feedback efficiency is relatively low. Importantly, we show that a more standard double-sided feedback scheme is not appropriate to cooperate with a Fano-mirror system.</description>

Abstract: The standard way to generate many-body quantum correlations is via a dynamical protocol: an initial product state is transformed by interactions that generate non-classical correlations at later times. Here, we show that many-body Bell correlations are inherently present in the eigenstates of a variety of spin-1/2 chains. In particular, we show that the eigenstates and thermal states of the collective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model possess many-body Bell correlations. We demonstrate that the Bell correlations can take on quantized values that change discontinuously with variations in the total magnetization. Finally, we show that these many-body Bell correlations persist even in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder.</description>

      <title>Generating multipartite nonlocality to benchmark quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that quantum computers can be used for producing large $n$-partite nonlocality, thereby providing a method to benchmark them. The main challenges to overcome are as follows: (i) The interaction topology might not allow arbitrary two-qubit gates. (ii) Noise limits the Bell violation. (iii) The number of combinations of local measurements grows exponentially with $n$. To overcome (i), we point out that graph states that are compatible with the two-qubit connectivity of the computer can be efficiently prepared. To mitigate (ii), we note that for specific graph states, there are $n$-partite Bell inequalities whose resistance to white noise increases exponentially with $n$. To address (iii) for any $n$ and any connectivity, we introduce an estimator that relies on random sampling. As a result, we propose a method for producing $n$-partite Bell nonlocality with unprecedented large $n$. This allows one, in return, to benchmark nonclassical correlations regardless of the number of qubits or the connectivity. We test our approach by using a simulation for a noisy IBM quantum computer, which predicts $n$-partite Bell nonlocality for at least $n=24$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Minimal operational theories: classical theories with quantum features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of probabilistic theories, termed Minimal Strongly Causal Operational Probabilistic Theories (MSOPTs), where system dynamics are constrained to the minimal set of operations consistent with the set of states and permitting conditional tests. Specifically, allowed instruments are limited to those derived from compositions of preparations, measurements, swap transformations, and conditional operations. We demonstrate that minimal theories with conditioning and a spanning set of non-separable states satisfy two quantum no-go theorems: no-information without disturbance and no-broadcasting. As a key example, we construct Minimal Strongly Causal Bilocal Classical Theory (MSBCT), a classical toy-theory that lacks incompatible measurements, preparation uncertainty relations, and is noncontextual (both Kochen-Specker and generalised), yet exhibits irreversibility of measurement disturbance, no-information without disturbance, and no-broadcasting. Therefore, the latter three properties cannot be understood $per se$ as signatures of non-classicality. We further explore distinctions between a theory and its minimal strongly causal counterpart, showing that while the minimal strongly causal version of quantum theory diverges from full quantum theory, the same does not hold for classical theory. Additionally, we establish the pairwise independence of the properties of simpliciality, strong causality, and local discriminability.</description>

      <title>Flow of non-classical correlations in cluster states due to projective measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the flow of quantum correlations in cluster states defined on ladder type graphs as measurements are done on qubits located on the nodes of the cluster. We focus on three qubits at the end of the ladder and compute the non-classical correlations between two of the three qubits as measurements are done on the remaining qubits. We compute both the entanglement between the two qubits as well as the quantum discord between them after the measurements. We see that after all but three qubits are measured, the non-classical correlations developed between two of them show a trend of being stronger with the length of the ladder. It is also seen that measurements on to the basis states of operators belonging to the Clifford group do not produce such correlations or entanglement. The non-classical correlations produced depend only on the number, location and nature of preceding non-Clifford measurements. Our results not only throw light on the dynamics of quantum correlations while an algorithm proceeds step-by-step in the Measurement-based Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) model but it also reveals how the last two qubits, treated as an open quantum system, can have increasing entanglement or other non-classical correlations as its immediate environment is interrogated through random measurements.</description>

      <title>Global Minimization of Electronic Hamiltonian 1-Norm via Linear Programming in the Block Invariant Symmetry Shift (BLISS) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cost of encoding a system Hamiltonian in a digital quantum computer as a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) grows with the 1-norm of the LCU expansion. The Block Invariant Symmetry Shift (BLISS) technique reduces this 1-norm by modifying the Hamiltonian action on only the undesired electron-number subspaces. Previously, BLISS required a computationally expensive nonlinear optimization that was not guaranteed to find the global minimum. Here, we introduce various reformulations of this optimization as a linear programming problem, which guarantees optimality and significantly reduces the computational cost. We apply BLISS to industrially-relevant homogeneous catalysts in active spaces of up to 76 orbitals, finding substantial reductions in both the spectral range of the modified Hamiltonian and the 1-norms of Pauli and fermionic LCUs. Our linear programming techniques for obtaining the BLISS operator enable more efficient Hamiltonian simulation and, by reducing the Hamiltonian's spectral range, offer opportunities for improved LCU groupings to further reduce the 1-norm.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced transitions for interacting fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effect of measurements on interacting fermionic systems with particle-number conservation, whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, is studied. We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified approach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations. Within this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model (NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce generating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly in the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM, we determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables. Crucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its symmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First, this leads to the "information-charge separation": charge cumulants get decoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the volume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$, the interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge cumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction, there are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions, for which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations using time-dependent variational principles for matrix product states, which, in particular, confirm the separation of information and charge as a hallmark of the delocalized phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of many-body quantum states in open systems is commonly numerically simulated by unraveling the density matrix into pure-state trajectories. In this work, we introduce a new unraveling strategy that can adaptively minimize the averaged entanglement in the trajectory states. This enables a more efficient classical representation of trajectories using matrix product decompositions. Our new approach is denoted non-unitarity maximizing unraveling (NUMU). It relies on the idea that adaptively maximizing the averaged non-unitarity of a set of Kraus operators leads to a more efficient trajectory entanglement destruction. Compared to other adaptive entanglement lowering algorithms, NUMU is computationally inexpensive. We demonstrate its utility in large-scale simulations with random quantum circuits. NUMU lowers runtimes in practical calculations, and it also provides new insight on the question of classical simulability of quantum dynamics. We show that for the quantum circuits considered here, unraveling methods are much less efficient than full matrix product density operator simulations, hinting to a still large potential for finding more advanced adaptive unraveling schemes.</description>

      <title>Scalable and shallow quantum circuits encoding probability distributions informed by asymptotic entanglement analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encoding classical data in a quantum state is a key prerequisite of many quantum algorithms. Recently matrix product state (MPS) methods emerged as the most promising approach for constructing shallow quantum circuits approximating input functions, including probability distributions, with only linear number of gates. We derive rigorous asymptotic expansions for the decay of entanglement across bonds in the MPS representation depending on the smoothness of the input function, real or complex. We also consider the dependence of the entanglement on localization properties and function support. Based on these analytical results we construct an improved MPS-based algorithm yielding shallow and accurate encoding quantum circuits. By using Tensor Cross Interpolation we are able to construct utility-scale quantum circuits in a compute- and memory-efficient way. We validate our methods on heavy-tailed distributions important in finance, including on L\'evy distributions. We test the performance of the resulting quantum circuits by executing and sampling from them on IBM quantum devices, for up to 64 qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Linear Multistep Method for Using a Quantum Oracle with Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential equations are a crucial mathematical tool used in a wide range of applications. If the solution to an initial value problem (IVP) can be transformed into an oracle, it can be utilized in various fields such as search and optimization, achieving quadratic speedup with respect to the number of candidates compared to its classical counterpart. In the past, attempts have been made to implement such an oracle using the Euler method. In this study, we propose a quantum linear multistep method (QLMM) that applies the linear multistep method, commonly used to numerically solve IVPs on classical computers, to generate a numerical solution of the IVP for use in a quantum oracle. We also propose a method to find the optimal form of QLMM for a given IVP. Finally, through computer simulations, we derive the QLMM formulation for an example IVP and show that the solution from the optimized QLMM can be used in an optimization problem.</description>

      <title>Operator Spreading in Random Unitary Circuits with Unitary-invariant Gate Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random unitary circuits have become a model system to investigate information scrambling in quantum systems. In the literature, mostly random circuits with Haar-distributed gate operations have been considered. In this work, we investigate operator spreading in random unitary circuits in which the elementary gate operations are drawn from general unitary-invariant ensembles, which include the well-studied Haar-distributed random unitary circuits as a special case. Similar to the Haar-distributed case, the long-time behavior of operator spreading with the more general unitary-invariant gate distribution is governed by drift-diffusion equations characterized by the butterfly velocity $v_{\rm B}$ and a diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}$. Differences with the Haar-random case are (i) that it takes a finite time $\tau_{\rm b}$ until ensemble-averaged Pauli-string weights take a ``binary'' form, in which they depend only on whether Pauli operators inside the support of the Pauli strong are equal to the identity matrix, and (ii) that the operator spreading is characterized by a finite ``domain-wall width'' $n_{\rm DW}$ separating regions with a random-matrix-like Pauli-string distribution. To illustrate these findings, we perform explicit calculations for random unitary circuits distributed according to the Poisson kernel, which interpolates between the trivial and Haar-distributed circuits.</description>

      <title>Generalized Zurek's bound on the cost of an individual classical or quantum computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06838v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the minimal thermodynamic cost of an individual computation, where a single input $x$ is mapped to a single output $y$. In prior work, Zurek proposed that this cost was given by $K(x\vert y)$, the conditional Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ given $y$ (up to an additive constant which does not depend on $x$ or $y$). However, this result was derived from an informal argument, applied only to deterministic computations, and had an arbitrary dependence on the choice of protocol (via the additive constant). Here we use stochastic thermodynamics to derive a generalized version of Zurek's bound from a rigorous Hamiltonian formulation. Our bound applies to all quantum and classical processes, whether noisy or deterministic, and it explicitly captures the dependence on the protocol. We show that $K(x\vert y)$ is a minimal cost of mapping $x$ to $y$ that must be paid using some combination of heat, noise, and protocol complexity, implying a tradeoff between these three resources. Our result is a kind of "algorithmic fluctuation theorem" with implications for the relationship between the Second Law and the Physical Church-Turing thesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how time-dependent energy fluctuations impact the dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a noisy ramped quench of the transverse magnetic field in a quantum Ising chain. By numerically solving the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation of the mode-decoupled fermionic Hamiltonian of the problem, we identify two generic scenarios: Depending on the amplitude of the noise and the rate of the ramp, the expected periodic sequence of noiseless DQPTs may either be uniformly shifted in time or else replaced by a disarray of closely spaced DQPTs. Guided by an exact noise master equation, we trace the phenomenon to the interplay between noise-induced excitations which accumulate during the quench and the near-adiabatic dynamics of the massive modes of the system. Our analysis generalizes to any 1D fermionic two-band model subject to a noisy quench.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legendre transform between thermodynamic quantities such as the Helmholtz free energy and entropy plays a key role in the formulation of the canonical ensemble. In the standard treatment, the transform exchanges the independent variable from the system's internal energy to its conjugate variable -- the inverse temperature of the heat reservoir. In this article, we formulate a microscopic version of the transform between the free energy and Shannon entropy of the system, where the conjugate variables are the microstate probabilities and the energies (scaled by the inverse temperature). The present approach gives a non-conventional perspective on the connection between information-theoretic measure of entropy and thermodynamic entropy. We focus on the exact differential property of Shannon entropy, utilizing it to derive central relations within the canonical ensemble. Thermodynamics of a system in contact with the heat reservoir is discussed in this framework. Other approaches, in particular, Jaynes' maximum entropy principle is compared with the present approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report, for the first time, an implementation of fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) using matrix product state (MPS) trial wavefunctions, dubbed MPS-AFQMC. Calculating overlaps between an MPS trial and arbitrary Slater determinants up to a multiplicative error, a crucial subroutine in MPS-AFQMC, is proven to be #P-hard. Nonetheless, we tested several promising heuristics in successfully improving fermionic phaseless AFQMC energies. We also proposed a way to evaluate local energy and force bias evaluations free of matrix product operators. This allows for larger basis set calculations without significant overhead. We showcase the utility of our approach on one- and two-dimensional hydrogen lattices, even when the MPS trial itself struggles to obtain high accuracy. Our work offers a new set of tools that can solve currently challenging electronic structure problems with future improvements.</description>

      <title>Production and stabilization of a spin mixture of ultracold dipolar Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in quantum system driven by heavy-tailed stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomena when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>

      <title>Integration of Cobalt Ferromagnetic Control Gates for Electrical and Magnetic Manipulation of Semiconductor Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes however strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate FD-SOI nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.</description>

      <title>Formations of generalized Wannier-Stark ladders: Theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) is a basic concept, supporting periodic oscillation, widely used in many areas of physics. In this paper, we investigate the formations of WSL in generalized systems, including strongly correlated and non-Hermitian systems. We present a theorem on the existence of WSL for a set of general systems that are translationally symmetric before the addition of a linear potential. For a non-Hermitian system, the WSL becomes complex but maintains a real energy level spacing. We illustrate the theorem using 1D extended Bose-Hubbard models with both real and imaginary hopping strengths. It is shown that the Bloch-Zener oscillations of correlated bosons are particularly remarkable under resonant conditions. Numerical simulations for cases with boson numbers $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ are presented. Analytical and numerical results for the time evolution of the $n$-boson-occupied initial state indicate that all evolved states exhibit quasi periodic oscillations, but with different profiles, depending on the Hermiticity and interaction strength.</description>
