      <title>Multi wavefunction overlap and multi entropy for topological ground states in (2+1) dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-wavefunction overlaps -- generalizations of the quantum mechanical inner product for more than two quantum many-body states -- are valuable tools for studying many-body physics. In this paper, we investigate the multi-wavefunction overlap of (2+1)-dimensional gapped ground states, focusing particularly on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. We demonstrate how these overlaps can be calculated using the bulk-boundary correspondence and (1+1)-dimensional edge theories, specifically conformal field theory. When applied to SPT phases, we show that the topological invariants, which can be thought of as discrete higher Berry phases, can be extracted from the multi-wavefunction overlap of four ground states with appropriate symmetry actions. Additionally, we find that the multi-wavefunction overlap can be expressed in terms of the realignment of reduced density matrices. Furthermore, we illustrate that the same technique can be used to evaluate the multi-entropy -- a quantum information theoretical quantity associated with multi-partition of many-body quantum states -- for (2+1)-dimensional gapped ground states. Combined with numerics, we show that the difference between multi-entropy for tripartition and second R\'enyi entropies is bounded from below by $(c_{{\it tot}}/4)\ln 2$ where $c_{{\it tot}}$ is the central charge of ungappable degrees of freedom. To calculate multi-entropy numerically for free fermion systems (such as Chern insulators), we develop the correlator method for multi-entropy.</description>

      <title>Universality Class Transition Across the Helimagnetic Ordering in Te-doped Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ is a multiferroic insulating chiral magnet which exhibits various magnetic orderings at different conditions. The positions of these magnetic phase transitions are known to be sensitive to chemical substitution. Here, we present a universality class analysis of the Cu$_2$OSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$O$_3$ with $(0\leq x \leq 0.1)$. Tellurium is a non-magnetic ion which, upon substitution into the selenium positions of the structure, applies a positive chemical pressure and expands the crystal lattice. Our SANS and magnetometry data indicate that Te inclusion lowers the paramagnetic to helical ordering temperature and the critical field required for the conical to field polarised phase transition. By using the Heat-map Modified Iteration Method that evaluates critical behaviour on both sides of the transition, we show that the Heisenberg to Ising universality class transition of the initial ordering is robust to internal chemical pressure. Additionally, we attribute the decreases with doping in both critical temperature and critical field to be due to decreases in the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Symmetric Exchange Interactions.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study on heavy-fermion behavior in LiV$_2$O$_4$: Role of Hund's coupling and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiV$_2$O$_4$ is a member of the so-called $3d$ heavy fermion compounds, with effective electron mass exceeding 60 times the free electron mass, comparable to $4f$ heavy fermion compounds. The origin of the strong electron correlation in combination with its metallic character have been a subject of intense theoretical and experimental discussion, with Kondo-like physics and Mott-physics being suggested as its physical origin. Here we report state-of-the art \textit{ab initio} Density Functional Theory + dynamical mean-field theory calculations for LiV$_2$O$_4$ for the full three orbital V $t_\mathrm{2g}$ manifold, and present temperature-dependent spectral properties. We map out the phase diagram for a representative 3-orbital model system as a function of doping and interaction strength, which indicates that LiV$_2$O$_4$ is located between two orbital-selective Mott phases, giving rise to a robust strongly correlated Hund's metal behavior. At low temperature we find the emergence of a strongly renormalized sharp quasi-particle peak a few meV above the Fermi level of V $a_\mathrm{1g}$ character, in agreement with experimental reports.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic electronic phase separation and competition between $G$-type, $C$-type and $CE$-type charge and orbital ordering modes in Hg$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel series of hole-doped quadruple manganite perovskites Hg$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ (HNMO) has been synthesized and its charge and orbital order behavior investigated through high-resolution synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction techniques. Through careful Rietveld refinements of structural models $via$ symmetry-motivated approaches, we show that the ground state of HNMO compositions adopts a polar $G$-type charge and orbital ordered state, which is rare in manganite perovskites, and is robust as a sole phase up to a critical doping level. Upon this critical doping, coincident with that in which colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is maximal in canonical manganite perovskites, electronic phase separation occurs between $G$-type and orbital order with charge disorder-type states. The latter state has recently been identified in Ca$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ perovskites, and proposed to be the competing insulating state from which CMR phenomena emerges. We show the mechanism for the formation of the $G$-type state is due to charge transfer processes which may occur through a coupling of distortions involving structural and charge and orbital degrees of freedom, ultimately driving the polar ground state through an improper-like ferroelectric polarization mechanism. These results will act as an important recipe for designing novel ferroelectric-active materials, in addition to expanding the richness of charge and orbital ordered states in manganite perovskites.</description>

      <title>Towards absolutely stable ergodicity breaking in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new physically reasonable systems capable of avoiding ergodicity at infinite time in the thermodynamic limit, even with generic perturbations and when coupled to a heat bath. In two dimensions, the rainbow loop soup has (stretched) exponentially numerous absolutely stable nonergodic states with diverging energy but vanishing energy density. In three dimensions the rainbow membrane soup has (stretched) exponentially numerous nonergodic states with diverging energy barriers, leading to infinite-time robust ergodicity breaking that even survives coupling to a nonzero temperature heat bath. We describe our results in the language of exact emergent symmetries and demonstrate how the systems avoid common instabilities. Our construction naturally connects to quantum dimer models, topologically ordered systems, the group word construction, and Hamiltonians whose low-energy eigenstates exhibit anomalous entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Free Localization for Benchmarking Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder-free localization (DFL) is a phenomenon as striking as it appears to be simple: a translationally invariant state evolving under a disorder-free Hamiltonian failing to thermalize. It is predicted to occur in a number of quantum systems exhibiting emergent or native \emph{local} symmetries. These include models of lattice gauge theories and, perhaps most simply, some two-component spin chains. Though well-established analytically for special soluble examples, numerical studies of generic systems have proven difficult. Moreover, the required local symmetries are a challenge for any experimental realization. Here, we show how a canonical model of DFL can be efficiently implemented on gate-based quantum computers, which relies on our efficient encoding of three-qubit gates. We show that the simultaneous observation of the absence of correlation spreading and tunable entanglement growth to a volume law provides an ideal testbed for benchmarking the capabilities of quantum computers. In particular, the availability of a soluble limit allows for a rigorous prediction of emergent localization length scales and tunable time scales for the volume law entanglement growth, which are ideal for testing capabilities of scalable quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Exact spectral form factors of non-interacting fermions with Dyson statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed $\textit{exactly}$. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ or time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Extendibility of fermionic states and rigorous ground state approximations of interacting fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving interacting fermionic quantum many-body problems as they are ubiquitous in quantum chemistry and materials science is a central task of theoretical and numerical physics, a task that can commonly only be addressed in the sense of providing approximations of ground states. For this reason, it is important to have tools at hand to assess how well simple ansatzes would fare. In this work, we provide rigorous guarantees on how well fermionic Gaussian product states can approximate the true ground state, given a weighted interaction graph capturing the interaction pattern of the systems. Our result can be on the one hand seen as a extendibility result of fermionic quantum states: It says in what ways fermionic correlations can be distributed. On the other hand, this is a non-symmetric de-Finetti theorem for fermions, as the direct fermionic analog of a theorem due to Brandao and Harrow. We compare the findings with the distinctly different situation of distinguishable finite-dimensional quantum systems, comment on the approximation of ground states with Gaussian states and elaborate on the connection to the no low-energy trivial state conjecture.</description>

      <title>Extensions to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model: Linear chains and their topological properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model describes the dynamics of spinless fermions in a one-dimensional lattice, with sublattices $A$ and $B$, and governed by staggered hopping potentials $v$ and $w$ representing the intracell and intercell hopping energies, respectively. In this study, we extend the SSH model into three distinct types: a trimer chain, the generalized trimer chain, and a hexagonal chain. The trimer chain involves three sublattices with intracell and intercell hopping potentials $v$ and $w$, respectively. The generalized trimer chain incorporates the intracell hopping $v_1$ and $v_2$ and intercell hopping $w_1$ and $w_2$ to differentiate the hopping energies between different sublattices in the chain. The hexagonal chain is composed of six sublattices with intracell hopping potential $v$ and intercell hopping potential $w$. We utilize exact diagonalization to determine the bulk eigenvalues of the different models. We find that in the trimer and generalized trimer chain, the bulk eigenvalues exhibit conducting characteristics, independent of the hopping parameter, owing to the presence of a flat band situated along the Fermi energy. In the hexagonal chain, the bulk eigenvalues display semi-metallic characteristics in the region $v&lt;w$ and metallic when $v=0$. Furthermore, we investigate the presence of conducting edge states in the finite chains. The trimer and hexagonal chains show the presence of topologically protected edge states which are manifestations of one-dimensional topological insulators. We also established the bulk-boundary correspondence to calculate for the winding number that predicts the existence of localized edge states in the topological nontrivial phase.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state generalization of the multi-entropy through the canonical purification, which we called reflected multi-entropy. We propose the holographic dual of this measure. For the tripartite case, a field-theoretical calculation is performed using a six-point function of twist operators at large $c$ limit. At both zero and finite temperature, the field-theoretical results match the holographic results exactly, supporting our holographic conjecture of this new measure.</description>

      <title>A unified quantum framework for electrons and ions: The self-consistent harmonic approximation on a neural network curved manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical solution of the many-body problem of interacting electrons and ions beyond the adiabatic approximation is a key challenge in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and materials science. Traditional methods to solve the multi-component quantum Hamiltonian tend to be specialized electrons or ions and can suffer from a methodological gap when applied to both electrons and ions simultaneously. In addition, ionic techniques often limited as $T\to$ 0K, whereas electronic methods are designed for 0K. Thus, efficient strategies that simultaneously address the thermal fluctuations of ions at ambient temperature without struggling to describe the electronic quantum state from first principles are missing.
  This work extends the self-consistent harmonic approximation for the ions to include also the electrons. The approach minimizes the total free energy by optimizing an \emph{ansatz} density matrix, solving a fermionic self-consistent harmonic Hamiltonian on a curved manifold, which is parametrized through a neural network. We demonstrate that this approach, designed initially for a flat Cartesian space to treat quantum nuclei at finite temperatures, can efficiently tackle both the ground and excited state properties of electronic systems, thus paving the way to a unified quantum description for electrons and atomic nuclei. Importantly, this approach preserves an analytical expression for entropy, enabling the direct computation of free energies and phase diagrams of materials.
  We benchmark the numerical implementation in several prototypical cases, proving that it captures quantum tunneling, electron-ion cusps, and static electronic correlations in the dissociation of H$_2$, where other mean-field approaches fail.</description>

      <title>Sign structure of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$J$ model and its physical consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13498v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the doped Mott insulator is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this work, we first explicitly identify a new sign structure in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the square lattice that replaces the conventional Fermi statistics for weakly interacting electrons. Then we show that the singular, i.e., the phase-string part of the sign structure in the partition function can be precisely turned off in a modified model. The density matrix renormalization group method is then employed to study these two models comparatively on finite-size systems, which is designed to unveil the consequences of the phase-string component. We find that the hole pairing is present not only in the quasi-long-range superconducting phase but also in the stripe phase of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model. However, once the phase-string is switched off, both the superconducting and stripe orders together with the underlying hole pairing disappear. The corresponding ground state reduces to a trivial Fermi-liquid-like state with small hole Fermi pockets that is decoupled from the antiferromagnetic spin background. It is in sharp contrast to the original $t$-$t'$-$J$ model where large Fermi surfaces can be restored in the stripe phase found at $t'/t&lt;0$ or the superconducting phase at $t'/t&gt;0$ in the six-leg ladder calculation. Our study clearly demonstrates that the strong correlation effect in doped Mott insulator should be mainly attributed to the long-range quantum entanglement between the spin and charge, which is, non-perturbatively, beyond a simple spin-charge separation under the no double occupancy constraint.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Ising charge correlations in the kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we resolve the real-space nature of the high-temperature, short-range charge correlations in the kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Diffuse scattering appears along a frustrated wave vector $\textbf{q}_H=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ at temperatures far exceeding the charge order transition $T_{CO}=92~\mathrm{K}$, preempting long-range charge order with wave vectors along $\textbf{q}_{\bar{K}}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$. Using a combination of real space and reciprocal space analysis, we resolve the nature of the interactions between the primary out-of-plane Sc-Sn chain instability and the secondary strain-mediated distortion of the in-plane V kagome network. A minimal model of the diffuse scattering data reveals a high-temperature, short-ranged "zig-zag" phase of in-plane correlations that maps to a frustrated triangular lattice Ising model with antiferromagnetic interactions and provides a real-space understanding of the origin of frustrated charge order in this material.</description>

      <title>Ternary nickel hydrides: a new platform for unconventional superconductivity and quantum magnetism</title>

Abstract: In this letter, we propose ternary nickel hydrides MNiH2 (M = Li, Na) as new materials that mimic cuprate physics but have important differences and interesting properties. Ni-H bands are wider than in oxides due to shorter bond lengths and covalency is larger than in Ni oxides which leads to a large scale of magnetic interactions. The charge transfer energy is smaller than in LaNiO2 which in cuprates translates to a larger Tc. We notice the formation of the electride band close to the Fermi surface which appears due to H vacancy along the c lattice vector. The considerable difference with cuprates arises from dz2 orbitals hybridization with interstitial orbitals allowing charge transfer to an apical vacancy state and self-doping the cuprate like Ni dx2-y2 H s antibonding bands which suggests that stoichiometric NaNiH2 may already be metallic and superconducting.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocity is necessary for robust dimensional reduction and strong responses in stochastic topological systems</title>

Abstract: Topological theory predicts the necessary conditions for robust dimensional reduction in a host of quantum and classical systems. Models have recently been proposed for stochastic systems which describe many biological and chemical phenomena. However, general theoretical principles are lacking for this class of systems, exemplified by the breakdown of the celebrated bulk-edge correspondence. We prove that contrary to topological phases in quantum and many classical systems, stochastic systems require non-reciprocal (or non-Hermitian) transitions for robust edge responses, which holds across all dimensions and geometries. We propose a novel explanation of hybridization that destroys edge responses in reciprocal (Hermitian) stochastic systems. Further, we show that stochastic steady states grow dramatically with non-reciprocity, in contrast to their quantum counterparts which plateaus. We analyze the resulting theoretical and physical consequences and how non-reciprocity mitigates the effects of hybridization towards robust edge states in equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states. These results establish the crucial role of non-reciprocal interactions for responses that are robust to random perturbations in active and living matter.</description>

      <title>Gauged Gaussian PEPS -- A High Dimensional Tensor Network Formulation for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including QCD.</description>
