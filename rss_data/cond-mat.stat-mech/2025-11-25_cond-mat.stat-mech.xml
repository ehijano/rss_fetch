      <title>On the uniqueness of the coupled entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled entropy is proven to uniquely satisfy the requirement that a generalized entropy be equivalent to the density at the scale for scale-shape distributions. Further, its maximizing distributions, the coupled stretched exponential distributions, are proven to quantify the linear uncertainty with the scale and the nonlinear uncertainty with the shape for a broad class of complex systems. Distributions of the coupled exponentials include the Pareto Types I-IV and Gosset's Student-t. For the Pareto Type II distribution, the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy has a linear dependence on the shape, which dominates over the logarithmic dependence on the scale, motivating the need for a generalization. The R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies are shown to be of historic importance but ultimately unsatisfactory generalizations. The coupled entropy of the coupled stretched exponential distribution isolates the nonlinear-shape dependence to a generalized logarithm of the partition function. The R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies retain a strong dependence on the nonlinear-shape such that they are not equivalent to the uncertainty at the scale. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven in support of an axiomatic definition. The scope of the coupled entropy includes systems in which the growth of states is power-law, stretched exponential, or a combination.</description>

      <title>Dissipation anomaly in gradient-driven nonequilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipation anomaly-the persistence of finite energy dissipation in the inviscid limit-is a hallmark of turbulence, sometimes regarded as the "zeroth law" of turbulent flows. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not exclusive to turbulence. Using fluctuating hydrodynamics, we show that a simple gradient-driven nonequilibrium steady state, in which a fluid is subjected to a constant scalar gradient but remains macroscopically quiescent, also exhibits dissipation anomaly. Direct numerical simulations and self-consistent mode-coupling theory reveal that the anomaly originates from giant, long-range nonequilibrium fluctuations amplified by the imposed gradient. While linear theory predicts a divergent dissipation in the inviscid limit, nonlinear mode coupling regularizes the divergence, yielding a finite anomalous dissipation. Our findings identify a new, non-turbulent arena for dissipation anomaly and establish the interplay between thermal noise and nonequilibrium driving as a fundamental route to singular behavior in hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectral mechanism and nearly reducible transfer matrices for pseudotransitions in one-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While true phase transitions are forbidden in one-dimensional systems with short-range interactions, several models have recently been shown to exhibit sharp yet analytic thermodynamic anomalies that mimic thermal phase transitions. We show that this behavior arises from transfer matrices that are mathematically irreducible but possess a nearly block-diagonal structure due to the weak contribution of off-diagonal Boltzmann weights in the low-temperature regime. This results in weakly coupled competing sectors whose eigenvalue competition produces abrupt crossovers without nonanalyticity, a mechanism we term nearly block-diagonal irreducible. A key thermodynamic signature of such pseudotransitions is that the residual entropy at the interface remains bounded between the residual entropies of the competing sectors. We develop a general spectral framework to describe this behavior and apply it to two representative models: the Ising chain with internal degeneracy (Doniach model) and a hexagonal nanowire chain with mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 components. In the first case, we derive exact expressions for the pseudo-critical temperature and residual entropy. In the second, we reduce the full $1458\times1458$ transfer matrix via symmetry decomposition and construct a low-rank effective matrix that accurately captures the crossover between quasi-ferromagnetic and quasi-core-ferromagnetic regimes. Our results demonstrate that pseudotransitions can be understood as spectral phenomena emerging from irreducible but functionally decoupled structures within the transfer matrix.</description>

      <title>First-Passage Times for the Space Fractional Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the random walk framework to include compounded steps, providing first-passage time (FPT) properties for a new class of superdiffusive processes, which are governed by the space-fractional spectral Fokker-Planck equation. This first-passage process leads to novel FPT properties, different from L\'evy flights and walks, that account for space dependent forces and hitting boundaries throughout the path of a jump. The FPT distribution can be derived for different types of barriers and potentials, for which we also provide specific examples. For the one-sided absorbing boundary on the semi-infinite line, we find that the FPT density scales as $t^{-1/(2\alpha)-1}$, in agreement with the method of images but in violation of the Sparre-Andersen scaling. In this case, there exists an optimal space-fractional exponent $\alpha$ to minimize the mean FPT.</description>

      <title>Inertia-chirality interplay in active Brownian motion: exact dynamics and phase maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact, time-resolved theory for a two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particle (cABP) with translational inertia. Using a Laplace-transform moment hierarchy, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean velocity, velocity-orientation projections, velocity autocorrelation, mean-squared velocity, mean-squared displacement, and the fourth moment of velocity. These results agree quantitatively with simulations over all masses, activities, and chiralities. We show that the velocity autocorrelation factorizes into an inertial envelope and a chiral envelope. Despite rich transients in the velocity sector, the long-time positional diffusion equals the overdamped cABP value, independent of mass. From the steady mean-squared velocity, we define a kinetic temperature and a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation whose violation vanishes in two limits: large mass or large chirality, identifying chirality as an additional route to equilibrium-like behavior. The steady-state velocity excess kurtosis gives a phase map that exhibits a (Gaussian-like)-active(bimodal)-(Gaussian-like) re-entrance with mass; chirality confines activity and shrinks the active sector. A narrow positive-kurtosis window emerges at large mass and intermediate chirality, with analytic boundaries consistent with the heavy-mass asymptote.</description>

      <title>Evolving criticality in iterative bicolored percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criticality is traditionally regarded as an unstable, fine-tuned fixed point of the renormalization group. We introduce an iterative bicolored percolation process in two dimensions and show that it can both preserve and transform criticality. Starting from critical configurations, such as the O$(n)$ loop and fuzzy Potts models, successive coarse-graining generates a hierarchy of distinct yet critical generations. Using the conformal loop ensemble, we derive exact, generation-dependent fractal dimensions, which are quantitatively confirmed by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The evolutionary trajectory depends not only on the universality class of the initial state but also on whether it possesses a two-state critical structure, leading to different critical exponents starting from site and bond percolation. These results establish a general geometric mechanism for evolving criticality, in which scale invariance persists across generations.</description>

      <title>L\'evy noise drives an exponential acceleration in transition rates within metastable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: L\'evy noise influences diverse non-equilibrium systems across scales, including quantum devices, active biological matter, and financial markets. While such noise is pervasive, its overall impact on activated transitions between metastable states remains unclear, despite prior studies of specific noise forms and scaling limits. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for L\'evy noise defined by its finite intensity and independent stationary increments. By identifying the most probable transition paths as minimizers of a stochastic action functional, we derive analytical scaling laws for escape rates under weak noise, thereby extending the classical Arrhenius law. Our results demonstrate that L\'evy noise universally enhances escape efficiency by reducing the effective potential barrier compared to Gaussian noise with equivalent intensity. Strikingly, even vanishingly weak L\'evy noise can exponentially increase escape rates across a broad range of amplitude distributions. This phenomenon arises from discontinuous most probable transition paths, where escape occurs via finite jumps. We validate these paths through the cumulant-generating function, a path integral representation, the mean first passage time and numerical simulations. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions in escape dynamics under thermal and athermal fluctuations, suggesting new strategies to optimize switching processes in metastable systems through engineering noise properties.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Grassmann-Pfaffian Framework for Monomer-Dimer and Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables that establishes master identities for exponential quadratic fermionic forms and linear fermionic forms coupled to both bosonic and fermionic sources. The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10). Overall, this work offers a flexible toolkit for the theoretical analysis and computational implementation of graph-based models and lattice field theories using Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables .</description>

      <title>Three faces of random walks in hyperbolic domain: BKT, Lifshitz tails, and KPZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that continuous random walks (diffusion) in the Poincar\'{e} hyperbolic upper halfplane $\mathbb{H}^2 = {(x,y)}|y&gt;0$, interpreted as multiplicative stochastic processes with log-normal statistics, provide a unifying framework linking three seemingly unrelated phenomena: (i) the non-analytic divergence of corrrelation length at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition; (ii) the appearence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang 9KPZ) exponent in the fluctuational behavior of stretched random walks constrained above an impermeable disc; and (iii) the emergence of Lifshitz tails in one-dimensional statistics of rare events. Combining scaling arguments with analytic derivations and numerical analysis, we adapt the renormalization-group equations originally developed for the Efimov effect in a two-dimensional conformally invariant potential to the case of diffusion in $\mathbb{H}^2$, thereby deriving the BKT-type divergence of the correlation length. We further demonstrate how the KPZ-type scaling governs the large-deviation behavior and survival probability near the boundary in the hyperbolic domain, and how Lifshitz tails arise naturally in a deterministic large-deviation landscape on the hyperbolic plane via instanton approach, reproducing the rare-event statistics of one-dimensional diffusion in the array of traps with the Poisson distribution. We conjecture that the dominant contribution to the ensemble of paths responsible for BKT-like physics comes from random paths pushed to large-deviation stretched regime.</description>

      <title>Dual thermal pseudo-critical features in a spin-1/2 Ising chain with twin-diamond geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coupled twin-diamond chain, a decorated one-dimensional Ising model motivated by the magnetic structure of \mathrm{Cu}_{2}(\mathrm{TeO}_{3})_{2}\mathrm{Br}_{2}. By applying an exact mapping to an effective Ising chain, we obtain the full thermodynamic description of the system through a compact transfer-matrix formulation. The ground-state analysis reveals five distinct phases, including two frustrated sectors with extensive degeneracy. These frustrated regions give rise to characteristic entropy plateaus and separate the ordered phases in the zero-temperature diagram. At low temperatures the model exhibits peculiar sharp yet continuous variations of entropy, magnetization, and response functions, reflecting clear signatures of pseudo-transition behavior. The coupled twin-diamond chain thus provides an exactly solvable setting in which competing local configurations and internal frustration lead to pronounced dual pseudo-critical features in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Failure of LMC statistical complexity in identifying structural order in the XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying complexity in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge, and many proposed measures fail to capture the structural features that intuitive or theoretical considerations would demand. Among them, the Lopez-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet (LMC) statistical complexity has been widely cited due to its simplicity and analytic tractability. Here, we examine the performance and limitations of the LMC measure in a controlled physical setting: a two-dimensional XY model studied through Monte Carlo simulations. By computing LMC complexity at each step of the system's relaxation dynamics, and directly comparing these values with the evolving dipole configurations, we show that LMC complexity systematically fails to identify states of high structural complexity. In particular, the measure often assigns maximal complexity to nearly equilibrated configurations while underestimating vortex-rich intermediate states. We further show that the time derivative of LMC complexity contains more meaningful dynamical information. We propose that future measures incorporate directionality and dynamical sensitivity to better reflect the emergence and decay of organization in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While equilibrium interfaces display universal large-scale statistics, interfaces in phase-separated active and driven systems are predicted to belong to distinct non-equilibrium universality classes. Yet, such behavior has proven difficult to observe, with most systems exhibiting equilibrium-like fluctuations despite their strongly non-equilibrium microscopic dynamics. We introduce an active hard-disk model that contrary to self-propelled models, displays clear non-equilibrium interfacial scaling and observe for the first time, the $|\boldsymbol q|$KPZ and wet-$|\boldsymbol q|$KPZ universality classes while revealing a new, previously overlooked universality class arising in systems with slow crystalline or glassy dynamics. These distinct classes are selected by conservation laws and slow hydrodynamic modes.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagrams of the YK Surface-Reaction Model on 2D lattices with Exchange Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phase diagrams of the Yaldram and Khan catalytic surface model on square and hexagonal lattices when exchange diffusion is allowed for carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen (N) atoms. To reach our goal, we carried out steady-state Monte Carlo (MC) simulations over $4\times 10^5$ points, for both lattices, in order to obtain a framework of the steady reactive state of the model for different values of the nitric oxide dissociation rate, $r_{NO}$. The results show the emergence of steady reactive state for certain values of $r_{NO}$ and of exchange diffusion rate $x$ when the simulations take place on square lattices. Our findings on the hexagonal lattice also show that the diffusion of these species favors the appearance of the active phase for values of $r_{NO}$ lower than that found for the standard model. In addition, we observed that the system possesses a continuous phase transition and a discontinuous one separating the active phase from absorbing states for both lattices, except for $r_{NO}=1$ in which the continuous phase transition is destroyed and a steady reactive state emerges from the beginning since very small values of $x$.</description>

      <title>Fate of diffusion under integrability breaking of classical integrable magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive transport is a ubiquitous phenomenon, yet the microscopic origin of diffusion in interacting physical systems remains a challenging question, irrespective of whether quantum effects are dominant or not. In this work, we study infinite temperature spin diffusion in a classical integrable, space-time discrete version of anisotropic Landau-Lifshitz magnet in the easy-axis regime, subjected to integrability-breaking perturbations. Our numerical results based on large-scale simulations reveal i) a sharp change in the spin diffusion constant as a function of perturbation strength in the thermodynamic limit and ii) a crossover from non-Gaussian to Gaussian statistics of magnetization transfer reflected in higher order cumulants under integrability breaking. Both our observations hint to the presence of non-trivial diffusion mechanism inherent to integrable systems.</description>

Unlike previous studies, which typically allowed for one single value of $K$ or sometimes a small assortment of fixed values, here a tiling may concomitantly employ $K$-mers comprising any number $K$ of cells, provided a maximality constraint is satisfied. In essence, this constraint requires each of the $K$-mers in use to be as lengthy as possible, given its surroundings in the resulting tiling. Maximality aims to limit the variety of possible tilings while allowing for interesting behavior in terms of the statistical physical observables of interest. In fact, by introducing an energy function based on cell contacts and parameterizing it appropriately, we have been able to observe relatively unexpected behavior, including the suggestion of phase transitions as the system's temperature evolves.</description>

Abstract: Consider a population of organisms that harvest free energy from their environment to reproduce. This paper shows that if the organisms' reproductive rates are proportional to the amount of physical free energy that they can convert into reproductive work, then the implicit probabilities that the organisms assign to environmental states are updated according to Bayes' rule.</description>

      <title>Probing Antiferromagnetic Hysteresis on Programmable Quantum Annealers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using programmable analog quantum annealing processors, we implement a sampling-based magnetic hysteresis protocol to probe the counterintuitive notion of magnetic memory of antiferromagnets. A key component of this protocol responsible for the hysteresis is a transverse field, which enables state transitions, while the magnetic field sweep is done via a longitudinal control field. We present evidence of full saturation and reversal of the hysteresis curve, as well as emergent magnetic domain mediated by quantum fluctuations that give rise to the magnetic memory effect in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Iterative improvement of free energy landscape reconstructions with optimal protocols derived from differentiable simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free energy landscapes encode the kinetics, intermediates, and transition states that govern molecular processes and are thus a key target of single biomolecule research. Typical approaches to deriving optimal, error-minimizing, non-equilibrium driving protocols for estimating these landscapes require a priori knowledge of the landscape. Here, we present an alternative: an iterative algorithm for optimizing full free energy landscape reconstructions which can be used alongside experiments on unknown landscapes. Our approach (i) takes experimental or simulated trajectory data; (ii) reconstructs an `approximate' energy landscape; (iii) derives optimal control protocols from low-dimensional differentiable Brownian dynamics simulations on the candidate landscape using automatic differentiation; (iv) re-runs the experiment or simulation using the updated protocol; and (v) iterates until convergence. Using this approach, we recover known benchmarks from the literature and probe far-from-equilibrium regimes for symmetric, asymmetric, and triple-well energy landscapes under both 1- and 2-dimensional control. Our control protocols -- derived with no a priori knowledge of the energy landscape -- yield substantially reduced variance and bias in free energy landscape reconstructions compared to naive linear protocols.</description>

      <title>Kicked-Ising Quantum Battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising candidates capable of outperforming classical counterparts by utilizing entangled operators. Spin chains, in particular, exhibit unique {charging} properties across diverse settings. Here, we introduce the kicked-Ising model as a QB and analytically characterize its charging dynamics within the self-dual operator regime, valid for arbitrary system sizes and Floquet cycles. Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Precision estimates of large charge RG exponents $Y_q$ in the 3D XY universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We accurately compute the RG exponents $Y_q$ of large $q$ fields at the $O(2)$ invariant fixed point in three dimensions. We build on an iterative approach that has been previously proposed and is implemented by using the worm algorithm. We simulate an improved XY model, that has next-to-next-to-nearest couplings in addition to nearest ones. In the worm update we incorporate weights, which allows us to obtain accurate results up to $q=64$. For example we get $Y_q=1.76370(12)$, $0.89167(23)$, and $-0.11203(34)$ for $q=2$, $3$, and $4$, respectively. The comparison with the large $q$ effective field theory gives an excellent agreement down to $q=4$ and provides accurate estimates of the parameters of the effective field theory.</description>

      <title>A calibrated model of debt recycling with interest costs and tax shields: viability under different fiscal regimes and jurisdictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Debt recycling is a leveraged equity management strategy in which homeowners use accumulated home equity to finance investments, applying the resulting returns to accelerate mortgage repayment. We propose a novel framework to model equity and mortgage dynamics in presence of mortgage interest rates, borrowing costs on equity-backed credit lines, and tax shields arising from interest deductibility. The model is calibrated on three jurisdictions -- Australia, Germany, and Switzerland -- representing diverse interest rate environments and fiscal regimes. Results demonstrate that introducing positive interest rates without tax shields contracts success regions and lengthens repayment times, while tax shields partially reverse these effects by reducing effective borrowing costs and adding equity boosts from mortgage interest deductibility. Country-specific outcomes vary systematically, and rental properties consistently outperform owner-occupied housing due to mortgage interest deductibility provisions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of oscillatory states of self-propelled colloids under optical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally the single-particle motion in water of silica colloidal beads half-coated with carbon under the action of a converging laser beam. The beads are self-propelled in this medium by means of self-thermophoresis resulting from local heating as a result of light absorption by their carbon cap. Within a certain laser power range, we find that these particles exhibit a quasi-two-dimensional active motion near a solid surface with stochastic rotational reversals when propelling themselves away from the region of maximum intensity, which leads to a stable trapping with oscillatory-like behavior inside the illuminated region. The orientation autocorrelation function of this type of confined active motion displays damped oscillations whose characteristic frequency increases with increasing propulsion speed, thus resulting in four regimes of translational motion depending on the observation time scale: thermal diffusion, ballistic motion, oscillatory behavior, and confinement. Our experimental findings are well described by a minimal phenomenological model that includes the nonlinear effect of a torque that reorients the particle toward the center of the optical confinement, which in combination with rotational diffusion gives rise to the observed orientational changes that allow their oscillatory trapping inside the light field. We also show that a similar active trapping mechanism emerges in the case of Janus colloidal rods, even though the periodicity is hindered by their three-dimensional rotation in the laser beam.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-limited linear response in fermionic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general connection between entanglement-entropy scaling laws and the linear response functions of particle-conserving fermionic systems in their ground state. Specifically, we show that the response to perturbations coupled to the particle number within a finite region exhibits the same size scaling as the entanglement entropy of that region. We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume. Our work thus establishes a direct link between linear-response properties and many-body entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simulation-based study of stochastic resonance (SR) in a ferroelectric capacitor is presented. The SR phenomenon involves the detection of weak signals by adding an optimal amount noise to a non-linear system. This is linked with Kramers' escape problem, which deals with the escape of a particle undergoing Brownian motion over an energy barrier. The position of the particle is analogous to the polarisation dynamics of a ferroelectric. Within this framework, we numerically investigate SR in single domain ferroelectrics using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory. In addition, we use a model for multidomain ferroelectrics to demonstrate feasibility in real world applications. Our results show that SR in ferroelectrics is promising for the purpose of weak signal detection, given that these materials are widely used for various applications in the semiconductor industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating entropy production, which quantifies irreversibility and energy dissipation, remains a significant challenge despite its central role in nonequilibrium physics. We propose a novel method for estimating the mean entropy production rate $\sigma$ that relies solely on position traces, bypassing the need for flux or microscopic force measurements. Starting from a recently introduced variance sum rule, we express $\sigma$ in terms of measurable steady-state correlation functions which we link to previously studied kinetic quantities, known as traffic and inflow rate. Under realistic constraints of limited access to dynamical degrees of freedom, we derive efficient bounds on $\sigma$ by leveraging the information contained in the system's traffic, enabling partial but meaningful estimates of $\sigma$. We benchmark our results across several orders of magnitude in $\sigma$ using two models: a linear stochastic system and a nonlinear model for spontaneous hair-bundle oscillations. Our approach offers a practical and versatile framework for investigating entropy production in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

Abstract: We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose Josephson junction arrays as realistic platforms for observing nonequilibrium scaling laws characterizing the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, and space-time soliton proliferation. Focusing on a two-chain ladder geometry, we perform numerical simulations for the roughness function. Together with analytical arguments, our results predict KPZ scaling at intermediate time scales, extending over sufficiently long time scales to be observable, followed by a crossover to the asymptotic long-time regime governed by soliton proliferation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equilibrium behaviours of a trilayered 6-state clock model have been investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. The intralayer interaction is considered ferromagnetic, whereas the interlayer interaction is antiferromagnetic. Periodic boundary conditions(PBC) are applied in XY plane and open boundary condition (OBC) is applied along Z-direction. The thermodynamic behaviours of sublattice magnetisation, total magnetisation, magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are studied as functions of the temperature. The interesting compensation phenomenon, when the total magnetisation vanishes keeping the nonzero sublattice magnetisations, has been observed. The compensation temperature and the critical temperature are found to depend on the strength of single-site anisotropy. The comprehensive phase diagram is shown in the temperature-anisotropy plane. The larger systems show the growth of the height of the peak of the susceptibility near the critical temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the continuous accumulation set ${\cal B}_q(p,\ell)$ of zeros of the chromatic polynomial $P(G^{(p,\ell)}_m,q)$ in the limit $m \to \infty$, on a family of graphs $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ defined such that $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ is obtained from $G^{(p,\ell)}_{m-1}$ by replacing each edge (i.e., bond) on $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ by $p$ paths each of length $\ell$ edges, starting with the tree graph $T_2$. Our method uses the property that the chromatic polynomial $P(G,q)$ of a graph $G$ is equal to the $v=-1$ evaluation of the partition function of the $q$-state Potts model, together with (i) the property that $Z(G^{(p,\ell)}_m,q,v)$ can be expressed via an exact closed-form real-space renormalization (RG) group transformation in terms of $Z(G^{(p,\ell)}_{m-1},q,v')$, where $v'=F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ is a rational function of $v$ and $q$ and (ii) ${\cal B}_q(p,\ell)(v)$ is the locus in the complex $q$-plane that separates regions of different asymptotic behavior of the $m$-fold iterated RG transformation $F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ in the $m \to \infty$ limit. Thus, our results involve calculations of region diagrams in the complex $q$-plane showing the type of behavior that occurs in the $m \to \infty$ limit of the $m$-fold iterated RG transformation mapping $F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ starting with the initial value $v=v_0=-1$. Calculations are presented of the maximal point $q_c(G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty)$ at which the locus ${\cal B}_q$ crosses the real-$q$ axis, as well as several other points at which, depending on $p$ and $\ell$, the locus ${\cal B}_q$ crosses this axis. We give explicit results for a variety of $(p,\ell)$ cases and observe a number of interesting features. Calculations of the ground-state degeneracy of the Potts antiferromagnet at $q_c(G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty)$ are presented. This work extends a previous study with R. Roeder of the $(p,\ell)=(2,2)$ case to higher $p$ and $\ell$ values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective resistance between any two nodes in a perturbed resistor network is determined by removing multiple bonds from an infinite resistor lattice. We have developed an efficient method for calculating the Green operator of the Laplacian for such perturbed networks, which is directly related to the two-point resistance. Unlike the recursive techniques that remove bonds one at a time, our approach handles all bond modifications simultaneously. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, several analytical and numerical examples are presented. In addition, we computed bond current distributions to gain deeper insight into the nature of resistor perturbations. We emphasize that our method has a broad range of applications, including condensed matter physics describing the quantum mechanical effects of impurities in crystal lattices, recently emerging topoelectronics, the study of vibrations in spring networks, and problems involving random walks.</description>

      <title>False signatures of non-ergodic behavior in disordered quantum many-body systems</title>

Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may \textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates and the outcomes of quench experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.</description>

      <title>Boundary reflection matrices of massive $\phi_{1,3}$-perturbed unitary minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose explicit expressions for the boundary reflection matrices of the ${\cal A}_m+(r,s)$ series of massive scattering theories, obtained by perturbing the ${\cal A}_m$ unitary minimal models with $(r,s)$ boundary conditions with both bulk and boundary $\phi_{1,3}$ operators. We identify the vacua that live on the boundary with the allowed edges of the $(r,s)$ conformal boundary conditions of the $A_m$ Andrews-Baxter-Forrester model. The boundary reflection matrices are then ``direct sums'' of certain pairs of $A_{m-1}$ Behrend-Pearce solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation and are consistent with the boundary bootstrap and the recently-introduced crossing, as well as the $Z_{2}$ (height-reversal), Kac table and non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13957v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</description>
