      <title>Evolution under Stochastic Transmission: Mutation-Rate Modifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In evolutionary models of large populations, it is common to analyze the effects of cyclic or random variation in the parameters that describe selection. It is less common, however, to study how stochasticity in the genetic transmission process itself affects evolutionary outcomes. Suppose that a gene locus has alleles $A$ and $a$ under constant selection. This locus is linked to a modifier locus with alleles $M_1$ and $M_2$, which control the mutation rate from $A$ to $a$. The Reduction Principle states that, near a mutation--selection balance where $M_1$ is fixed with mutation rate $u_1$, a rare allele $M_2$ can invade if its associated rate $u_2$ is lower than $u_1$. This result, valid for both haploids and diploids, assumes constant mutation rates through time. We extend this framework by allowing the mutation rate associated with $M_2$ to fluctuate randomly across generations, denoted as $u_{2,t}$. In this stochastic setting, the condition for invasion by a new modifier allele depends not only on the resident mutation rate $u_1$ and the mean mutation rate $u_2$ associated with the invading allele, but also on the temporal distribution of $u_{2,t}$, the strength of selection at the $A/a$ locus, and the recombination rate between $M_1/M_2$ and $A/a$. The analysis shows how stochasticity and recombination in transmission do not simply modify the magnitude of evolutionary change predicted under deterministic assumptions. Instead, through their interaction with selection and linkage, they can generate conditions under which the direction of modifier evolution is qualitatively reversed relative to the deterministic Reduction Principle.</description>

      <title>Topography, climate, land cover, and biodiversity: Explaining endemic richness and management implications on a Mediterranean island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Island endemism is shaped by complex interactions among environmental, ecological, and evolutionary factors, yet the relative contributions of topography, climate, and land cover remain incompletely quantified. We investigated the drivers of endemic plant richness across Crete, a Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, using spatially explicit data on species distributions, topographic complexity, climatic variability, land cover, and soil characteristics. Artificial Neural Network models, a machine learning tool, were employed to assess the relative importance of these predictors and to identify hotspots of endemism. We found that total species richness, elevation range, and climatic variability were the strongest predictors of endemic richness, reflecting the role of biodiversity, topographic heterogeneity, and climatic gradients in generating diverse habitats and micro-refugia that promote speciation and buffer extinction risk. Endemic hotspots only partially overlapped with areas of high total species richness, indicating that total species richness was the optimal from the ones examined, yet an imperfect surrogate. These environmentally heterogeneous areas also provide critical ecosystem services, including soil stabilization, pollination, and cultural value, which are increasingly threatened by tourism, renewable energy development, land-use change, and climate impacts. Our findings underscore the importance of prioritizing mountainous and climatically variable regions in conservation planning, integrating ecosystem service considerations, and accounting for within-island spatial heterogeneity. By explicitly linking the environmental drivers of endemism to both biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, this study provides a framework for evidence-based conservation planning in Crete and other Mediterranean islands with similar geological and biogeographic contexts.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Life as a Categorical Information-Handling Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living systems can be understood as organized entities that capture, transform, and reproduce information. Classical gene-centered models explain adaptation through frequency changes driven by differential fitness, yet they often neglect the higher-order organization and causal closure that characterize living systems. Here we review evolutionary frameworks, from the replicator equation to group selection and holobiont dynamics, and show that evolutionary change in population frequencies can be expressed as a Jeffreys divergence. In holobionts, this formalism allows partitioning the total information associated with selection acting on the genome and the microbiome, as well as the information involved in matching specific genotypes with particular microbiotas, yielding an informational signature of stable symbiotic coevolution. Building on this foundation, we propose a categorical model of Information Handlers (IH), entities capable of self-maintenance, mutation, and combination. Each lineage is represented as a discrete coalgebra with internal (M,R) closure, while the global system forms a supercategory of interacting lineages. Replication, reproduction, and transmission are modeled as morphisms whose informational changes are captured by a functor mapping biological transformations into transformations within an informational category, measurable through Jeffreys divergences. This framework connects gene-centered evolutionary dynamics with relational and organizational perspectives, offering a unified categorical view of living systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Resistance Development Mechanisms on Antibiotic Treatment Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics through various mechanisms, with the specific mechanism depending on the drug-bacteria pair. It remains unclear, however, which resistance mechanism best supports favorable treatment outcomes, specifically in clearing infections and inhibiting further resistance. In this study, we use periodic ordinary differential equation models to simulate different antibiotic treatment protocols for bacterial infections. Using stability analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate how different resistance mechanisms, including plasmid-induced and mutation-induced resistance, affect treatment outcomes. Our findings suggest that antibiotic treatments with fixed dosing schedules are more likely to be effective when resistance arises exclusively through plasmid-mediated transmission. Further, when treatment fails, mutation-driven mechanisms tend to favor the selection of fully resistant bacterial strains. We also investigated the efficacy of different treatment strategies based on these mechanisms, finding that a twice-daily regimen consistently outperforms a once-daily regimen in terms of infection clearance. Additionally, our simulations with short half-life antibiotics indicate that the "catch-up" strategy outperforms the "compensatory double-dose" approach after a missed dose, a finding that aligns with general pharmaceutical advice for short-half-life drugs.</description>

      <title>Improving Gene Trees without more data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating species and gene trees from sequence data is challenging. Gene tree estimation is often hampered by low phylogenetic signal in alignments, leading to inaccurate trees. Species tree estimation is complicated by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), where gene histories differ from the species' history. Summary methods like MP-EST, ASTRAL2, and ASTRID infer species trees from gene trees but suffer when gene tree accuracy is low. To address this, the Statistical Binning (SB) and Weighted Statistical Binning (WSB) pipelines were developed to improve gene tree estimation. However, previous studies only tested these pipelines using multi-locus bootstrapping (MLBS), not the BestML approach.
  This thesis proposes a novel pipeline, WSB+WQMC, which shares design features with the existing WSB+CAML pipeline but has other desirable properties and is statistically consistent under the GTR+MSC model. This study evaluated WSB+WQMC against WSB+CAML using BestML analysis on various simulated datasets. The results confirmed many trends seen in prior MLBS analyses. WSB+WQMC substantially improved gene tree and species tree accuracy (using ASTRAL2 and ASTRID) on most datasets with low, medium, and moderately high ILS levels. In a direct comparison, WSB+WQMC computed less accurate trees than WSB+CAML under certain low and medium ILS conditions. However, WSB+WQMC performed better or at least as accurately as WSB+CAML on all datasets with moderately high and high ILS. It also proved better for estimating gene trees on some medium and low ILS datasets. Thus, WSB+WQMC is a promising alternative to WSB+CAML for phylogenetic estimation, especially in the presence of low phylogenetic signal.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of a stochastic SVEIS epidemic model using Black-Karasinski process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a stochastic SVEIS epidemic model perturbed by a Black-Karasinski process. Using a Lyapunov functional approach, we derive a sufficient condition, Rs0&gt;1 for the existence of a stationary distribution, which indicates disease persistence. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate that the disease will die out at an exponential rate if Re0&lt;1 . Our results show that random fluctuations will facilitate disease outbreak.</description>

      <title>Modelling the interaction between ethnicity and infectious disease transmission dynamics in Aotearoa New Zealand during the first Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Aotearoa followed an elimination strategy followed by a mitigation strategy, which saw high success and kept health impact low. However, there were inequities in health outcomes, notably that M\=aori and Pacific Peoples had lower vaccine coverage and experienced higher age-standardised rates of hospitalisation and death. Models provide predictions of disease spread and burden, which can effectively inform policy, but are often less good at including inequities/heterogeneity. Despite the differences in health outcomes, most models have not explicitly considered ethnic heterogeneities as factors. We developed such a model to investigate the first Omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Aotearoa, which was the first widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We analysed three models for contact patterns within and between ethnicities: proportionate, assortative, and unconstrained mixing, which were fit using ethnicity-specific data on reported cases and spatially disaggregated population counts. We found that M\=aori, Pacific, and Asian transmission rates were between 1.08-2.46, 1.50-3.89, and 0.80-0.92 times the European rates, respectively. We then found that from the parameters considered in the model, the disparity in ethnic transmission rates explained the majority of the observed ethnic disparity in attack rates, while assortativity and vaccination rates explained comparatively less.</description>

      <title>The role of viral dynamics and infectivity in models of oncolytic virotherapy for tumours with different motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of ad-hoc engineered viruses in the fight against tumours is one of the greatest ideas in cancer therapeutics within the last three decades. Together with other strategies such as immunotherapies, nanoparticles and adjunct therapies, the use of viral vectors in clinical trials and in the clinics has been and is still widely studied and pursued. The ability of those vectors to infiltrate and infect tumours represents one of the key attributes that regulates the success of such a strategy. Although some remarkable successes have been obtained, it is still not entirely clear how to achieve reliable protocols that can be routinely employed with confidence on a significant range of tumours. In this work, we thus concentrate on the study of different mathematical descriptions of virotherapy with the aim of better understanding the role of viral infectivity and viral dynamics in positive therapeutic outcomes. In particular, we compare probabilistic, individual approaches with continuous, spatially inhomogeneous models and investigate the importance of different tumour motility and different mathematical representations of viral infectivity. These formulations also allow us to arrive at better analytical characterisation of how waves of viral infections arise and propagate in tumours, providing interesting insights into therapy dynamics. Similarly to previous studies, oscillatory behaviours, stochasticity and cancers' diffusivities are all central to the eradication or the escape of tumours under virotherapy. Here, though, our results also show that the ability of viruses to infect tumours seems, in certain cases, more important to a final positive outcome than tumours' motility or even reproducibility. This could hopefully represent a first step into better insights into viral dynamics that may help clinicians to achieve consistently better outcomes.</description>

      <title>A geometric analysis of the Bazykin-Berezovskaya predator-prey model with Allee effect in an economic framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a fast-slow version of the Bazykin-Berezovskaya predator-prey model with Allee effect evolving on two timescales, through the lenses of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). The system we consider is in non-standard form. We completely characterize its dynamics, providing explicit threshold quantities to distinguish between a rich variety of possible asymptotic behaviors. Moreover, we propose numerical results to illustrate our findings. Lastly, we comment on the real-world interpretation of these results, in an economic framework and in the context of predator-prey models.</description>

      <title>One pathogen does not an epidemic make: A review of interacting contagions, diseases, beliefs, and stories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From pathogens and computer viruses to genes and memes, contagion models have found widespread utility across the natural and social sciences. Despite their success and breadth of adoption, the approach and structure of these models remain surprisingly siloed by field. Given the siloed nature of their development and widespread use, one persistent assumption is that a given contagion can be studied in isolation, independently from what else might be spreading in the population. In reality, countless contagions of biological and social nature interact within hosts (interacting with existing beliefs, or the immune system) and across hosts (interacting in the environment, or affecting transmission mechanisms). Additionally, from a modeling perspective, we know that relaxing these assumptions has profound effects on the physics and translational implications of the models. Here, we review mechanisms for interactions in social and biological contagions, as well as the models and frameworks developed to include these interactions in the study of the contagions. We highlight existing problems related to the inference of interactions and to the scalability of mathematical models and identify promising avenues of future inquiries. In doing so, we highlight the need for interdisciplinary efforts under a unified science of contagions and for removing a common dichotomy between social and biological contagions.</description>
