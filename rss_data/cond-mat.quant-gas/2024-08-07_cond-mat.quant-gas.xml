      <title>Odd-parity effect and scale-dependent viscosity in atomic quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been predicted that two-dimensional electron gases possess an anomalous ``tomographic'' transport regime outside of the traditional collisionless and hydrodynamic limits, but an experimental confirmation has been elusive so far. This anomalous regime is marked by the appearance of an odd-even effect in the quasiparticle lifetimes where deformations of the Fermi surface with odd-parity become long-lived in comparison to even-parity ones. In this work, we establish neutral atomic quantum gases as an alternative platform to reveal this new transport regime and demonstrate an odd-even effect in the normal phase of two-component Fermi gases. By diagonalizing the Fermi liquid collision integral, we identify odd-parity modes with anomalously long lifetimes below temperatures $T\leq 0.1 T_F$, which is within the reach of current cold atom experiments. In a marked difference from condensed matter setups, we show that the odd-even effect in neutral gases is widely tunable with interactions along the BCS-BEC crossover and suppressed on the BEC side where the Fermi surface is destroyed. We propose the damping rate of quadrupole oscillations as an experimental signature of the long-lived odd-parity modes. The damping rate is set by the shear viscosity, which for finite trap confinement is dominated by odd-parity modes and thus anomalous enhanced compared to the hydrodynamic limit. Furthermore, a full computation of the shear viscosity within Fermi liquid theory shows that the magnitude of the odd-even effect depends on the particle number and is particularly pronounced in mesoscopic Fermi gases. Our findings suggest that the hydrodynamic behavior of neutral degenerate quantum gases is much richer than previously thought and should include additional long-lived modes.</description>

      <title>More General Soliton Solution for Vectorial Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WE derive exact and more general solutions of the two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equation with suitable parameters by demonstrating two analytical methods. In the first method, equations are analysed and inferred some of their mathematical and physical properties, which are then used to derive the exact stationary solutions. In the second method, we demonstrate the Darboux transformation method and construct exact and more general soliton solutions for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (NLS equation with external potential term). We have proved that the solutions were more general one by showcasing all kinds of soliton pairs by manoeuvring the parameters suitably.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point and hysteresis trajectories in cold Rydberg atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between strong long-range interactions and the coherent driving contribute to the formation of complex patterns, symmetry, and novel phases of matter in many-body systems. However, long-range interactions may induce an additional dissipation channel, resulting in non-Hermitian many-body dynamics and the emergence of exceptional points in spectrum. Here, we report experimental observation of interaction-induced exceptional points in cold Rydberg atomic gases, revealing the breaking of charge-conjugation parity symmetry. By measuring the transmission spectrum under increasing and decreasing probe intensity, the interaction-induced hysteresis trajectories are observed, which give rise to non-Hermitian dynamics. We record the area enclosed by hysteresis loops and investigate the dynamics of hysteresis loops. The reported exceptional points and hysteresis trajectories in cold Rydberg atomic gases provide valuable insights into the underlying non-Hermitian physics in many-body systems, allowing us to study the interplay between long-range interactions and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of dynamical gauge theories in periodically driven Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) is an exciting frontier in quantum science. Programmable quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays are a promising approach to achieve this goal, since strong Rydberg blockade interactions can be used to naturally create low energy subspaces that can encode local gauge constraints. However, realizing regimes of LGTs where both matter and gauge fields exhibit significant dynamics requires the presence of tunable multi-body interactions such as those associated with ring exchange, which are challenging to realize directly. Here, we develop a method for generating such interactions based on time-periodic driving. Our approach utilizes controlled deviations from time-reversed trajectories, which are accessible in constrained PXP-type models via the application of frequency modulated global pulses. We show that such driving gives rise to a family of effective Hamiltonians with multi-body interactions whose strength is non-perturbative in their respective operator weight. We apply this approach to a two-dimensional U(1) LGT on the Kagome lattice, where we engineer strong six-body magnetic plaquette terms that are tunable relative to the kinetic energy of matter excitations, demonstrating access to previously unexplored dynamical regimes. Potential generalizations and prospects for experimental implementations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of interactions and entanglement in periodically driven Rydberg chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays driven into Rydberg states constitute a promising approach for realizing programmable quantum systems. Enabled by strong interactions associated with Rydberg blockade, they allow for simulation of complex spin models and quantum dynamics. We introduce a new Floquet engineering technique for systems in the blockade regime that provides control over novel forms of interactions and entanglement dynamics in such systems. Our approach is based on time-dependent control of Rydberg laser detuning and leverages perturbations around periodic many-body trajectories as resources for operator spreading. These time-evolved operators are utilized as a basis for engineering interactions in the effective Hamiltonian describing the stroboscopic evolution. As an example, we show how our method can be used to engineer strong spin exchange, consistent with the blockade, in a one-dimensional chain, enabling the exploration of gapless Luttinger liquid phases. In addition, we demonstrate that combining gapless excitations with Rydberg blockade can lead to dynamic generation of large-scale multi-partite entanglement. Experimental feasibility and possible generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced resonance from the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equations</title>

Abstract: The confinement-induced resonances for trapped bosons in the cigar-shaped and pancake geometries are studied within the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equations, which are a simplified version of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. Although the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method is considered applicable only for small interparticle interactions, the resonance denominators for the chemical potential are obtained in both quasi-one and quasi-two dimensions. A useful integral representation of the one-particle Green's function are found for the cylindrical confinement. We find the position of a smoothed resonance for the chemical potential in the pancake geometry at positive scattering length.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling of a fermionic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Only bosonic molecular species have been directly laser cooled to date, primarily due to an abundance of bosonic isotopes in nature and to their simpler hyperfine structure. Fermionic molecules provide new opportunities for ultracold chemistry, quantum simulation, and precision measurements. Here we report direct laser cooling of a fermionic molecular isotopologue, calcium monodeuteride (CaD). With a nuclear spin I = 1, only 5 hyperfine states need to be addressed for rotational closure in optical cycling. These hyperfine states are unresolved for typical experimental linewidths. We present a method for efficiently producing alkaline-earth metal hydrides and deuterides. We demonstrate rotational closure and show magnetically assisted Sisyphus cooling in one dimension for a beam of CaD molecules. Our results indicate that the experimental complexity for laser cooling CaD is similar to that of calcium monohydride (CaH). Laser cooling of CaD is a promising first step for production of ultracold and trapped atomic deuterium.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and the non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>
