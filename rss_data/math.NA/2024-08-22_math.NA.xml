      <title>Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation Methods for PDEs with Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11171v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and compare two domain decomposition based numerical methods, namely the Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann Waveform Relaxation methods (DNWR and NNWR respectively), tailored for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) incorporating time delay. Time delay phenomena frequently arise in various real-world systems, making their accurate modeling and simulation crucial for understanding and prediction. We consider a series of model problems, ranging from Parabolic, Hyperbolic to Neutral PDEs with time delay and apply the iterative techniques DNWR and NNWR for solving in parallel. We present the theoretical foundations, numerical implementation, and comparative performance analysis of these two methods. Through numerical experiments and simulations, we explore their convergence properties, computational efficiency, and applicability to various types of PDEs with time delay.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the Proximal Operator of the $\ell_\infty$ Norm Using a Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the proximal operator of the $\ell_\infty$ norm, $\textbf{prox}_{\alpha ||\cdot||_\infty}(\mathbf{x})$, generally requires a sort of the input data, or at least a partial sort similar to quicksort. In order to avoid using a sort, we present an $O(m)$ approximation of $\textbf{prox}_{\alpha ||\cdot||_\infty}(\mathbf{x})$ using a neural network. A novel aspect of the network is that it is able to accept vectors of varying lengths due to a feature selection process that uses moments of the input data. We present results on the accuracy of the approximation, feature importance, and computational efficiency of the approach. We show that the network outperforms a "vanilla neural network" that does not use feature selection. We also present an algorithm with corresponding theory to calculate $\textbf{prox}_{\alpha ||\cdot||_\infty}(\mathbf{x})$ exactly, relate it to the Moreau decomposition, and compare its computational efficiency to that of the approximation.</description>

      <title>Kinetic scrape off layer simulations with semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin solver for the simulation of the scrape off layer for an electron-ion plasma. We use a time adaptive velocity space to deal with fast particles leaving the computational domain, a block structured mesh to resolve the sharp gradient in the plasma sheath, and limiters to avoid oscillations in the density function. In particular, we propose a limiter that can be computed directly from the information used in the semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin advection step. This limiter is particularly efficient on graphic processing units (GPUs) and compares favorable with limiters from the literature. We provide numerical results for a set of benchmark problems and compare different limiting strategies.</description>

      <title>A GPU accelerated mixed-precision Finite Difference informed Random Walker (FDiRW) solver for strongly inhomogeneous diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nature, many complex multi-physics coupling problems exhibit significant diffusivity inhomogeneity, where one process occurs several orders of magnitude faster than others in temporal. Simulating rapid diffusion alongside slower processes demands intensive computational resources due to the necessity for small time steps. To address these computational challenges, we have developed an efficient numerical solver named Finite Difference informed Random Walker (FDiRW). In this study, we propose a GPU-accelerated, mixed-precision configuration for the FDiRW solver to maximize efficiency through GPU multi-threaded parallel computation and lower precision computation. Numerical evaluation results reveal that the proposed GPU-accelerated mixed-precision FDiRW solver can achieve a 117X speedup over the CPU baseline, while an additional 1.75X speedup by employing lower precision GPU computation. Notably, for large model sizes, the GPU-accelerated mixed-precision FDiRW solver demonstrates strong scaling with the number of nodes used in simulation. When simulating radionuclide absorption processes by porous wasteform particles with a medium-sized model of 192x192x192, this approach reduces the total computational time to 10 minutes, enabling the simulation of larger systems with strongly inhomogeneous diffusivity.</description>

      <title>On Quasi-Localized Dual Pairs in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scattered data approximation, the span of a finite number of translates of a chosen radial basis function is used as approximation space and the basis of translates is used for representing the approximate. However, this natural choice is by no means mandatory and different choices, like, for example, the Lagrange basis, are possible and might offer additional features. In this article, we discuss different alternatives together with their canonical duals. We study a localized version of the Lagrange basis, localized orthogonal bases, such as the Newton basis, and multiresolution versions thereof, constructed by means of samplets. We argue that the choice of orthogonal bases is particularly useful as they lead to symmetric preconditioners. All bases under consideration are compared numerically to illustrate their feasibility for scattered data approximation. We provide benchmark experiments in two spatial dimensions and consider the reconstruction of an implicit surface as a relevant application from computer graphics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inversion for the identification of the doping profile in unipolar semiconductor devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rigorous Bayesian formulation of the inverse doping profile problem in infinite dimensions for a stationary linearized unipolar drift-diffusion model for semiconductor devices is given. The goal is to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the doping profile and to compute its posterior mean. This allows for the reconstruction of the doping profile from voltage-current measurements. The well-posedness of the Bayesian inverse problem is shown by proving boundedness and continuity properties of the semiconductor model with respect to the unknown parameter. A preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Markov chain Monte-Carlo method for the Bayesian estimation of the doping profile, using a physics-informed prior model, is proposed. The numerical results for a two-dimensional diode illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Finite element-based space-time total variation-type regularization of the inverse problem in electrocardiographic imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing cardiac electrical activity from body surface electric potential measurements results in the severely ill-posed inverse problem in electrocardiography. Many different regularization approaches have been proposed to improve numerical results and provide unique results. This work presents a novel approach for reconstructing the epicardial potential from body surface potential maps based on a space-time total variation-type regularization using finite elements, where a first-order primal-dual algorithm solves the underlying convex optimization problem. In several numerical experiments, the superior performance of this method and the benefit of space-time regularization for the reconstruction of epicardial potential on two-dimensional torso data and a three-dimensional rabbit heart compared to state-of-the-art methods are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Structured Backward Errors for Special Classes of Saddle Point Problems with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant research efforts have been dedicated recently to explore the structured backward error (BE) for saddle point problems (SPPs). However, these investigations overlook the inherent sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrix of the SPP. Moreover, the existing techniques are not applicable when the block matrices have Circulant, Toeplitz, or symmetric-Toeplitz structures and do not even provide structure preserving minimal perturbation matrices for which the BE is attained. To overcome these limitations, we investigate the structured BEs of SPPs when the perturbation matrices exploit the sparsity pattern as well as Circulant, Toeplitz, and symmetric-Toeplitz structures. Furthermore, we construct minimal perturbation matrices that preserve the sparsity pattern and the aforementioned structures. Two applications of the obtained results are discussed: (i) deriving structured BEs for the weighted regularized least squares problem and (ii) finding an effective and reliable stopping criterion for numerical algorithms. Finally, numerical experiments validate our findings, showcasing the utility of the obtained structured BEs in assessing the strong stability of numerical algorithms</description>

      <title>Slicing of Radial Functions: a Dimension Walk in the Fourier Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computations in high-dimensional spaces can often be realized only approximately, using a certain number of projections onto lower dimensional subspaces or sampling from distributions. In this paper, we are interested in pairs of real-valued functions $(F,f)$ on $[0,\infty)$ that are related by the projection/slicing formula $F (\| x \|) = \mathbb E_{\xi} \big[ f \big(|\langle x,\xi \rangle| \big) \big]$ for $x\in\mathbb R^d$, where the expectation value is taken over uniformly distributed direction in $\mathbb R^d$. While it is known that $F$ can be obtained from $f$ by an Abel-like integral formula, we construct conversely $f$ from given $F$ using their Fourier transforms. First, we consider the relation between $F$ and $f$ for radial functions $F(\| \cdot\| )$ that are Fourier transforms of $L^1$ functions. Besides $d$- and one-dimensional Fourier transforms, it relies on a rotation operator, an averaging operator and a multiplication operator to manage the walk from $d$ to one dimension in the Fourier space. Then, we generalize the results to tempered distributions, where we are mainly interested in radial regular tempered distributions. Based on Bochner's theorem, this includes positive definite functions $F(\| \cdot\| )$.</description>

      <title>A class of Parameterized Shift-Splitting Preconditioners for Regularized Three-by-Three Block Saddle Point Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a parameterized shift-splitting (PSS) preconditioner, along with its two relaxed variants to solve the regularized three-by-three block saddle point problem (RTBSPP). The convergence of the associated PSS iteration method is analyzed, and sufficient conditions on the parameters for convergence are established. Spectral analyses are performed to derive sharp bounds for the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrices. Numerical experiments based on examples arising from the PDE-constrained optimization problems are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed preconditioners compared with existing state-of-the-art preconditioners.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the expected logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem for random matrices. We generalize some known results for the Shub-Smale polynomials, and the spherical ensemble. These two processes are the two extremal particular cases of the polynomial eigenvalue problem, and we prove that the logarithmic energy lies between these two cases. In particular, the roots of the Shub-Smale polynomials are the ones with the lowest logarithmic energy of the family.</description>

      <title>The Ensemble Epanechnikov Mixture Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the high-dimensional setting, Gaussian mixture kernel density estimates become increasingly suboptimal. In this work we aim to show that it is practical to instead use the optimal multivariate Epanechnikov kernel. We make use of this optimal Epanechnikov mixture kernel density estimate for the sequential filtering scenario through what we term the ensemble Epanechnikov mixture filter (EnEMF). We provide a practical implementation of the EnEMF that is as cost efficient as the comparable ensemble Gaussian mixture filter. We show on a static example that the EnEMF is robust to growth in dimension, and also that the EnEMF has a significant reduction in error per particle on the 40-variable Lorenz '96 system.</description>

      <title>Zeitlin's model for axisymmetric 3-D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeitlin's model is a spatial discretization for the 2-D Euler equations on the flat 2-torus or the 2-sphere. Contrary to other discretizations, it preserves the underlying geometric structure, namely that the Euler equations describe Riemannian geodesics on a Lie group. Here we show how to extend Zeitlin's approach to the axisymmetric Euler equations on the 3-sphere. It is the first discretization of the 3-D Euler equations that fully preserves the geometric structure. Thus, this finite-dimensional model admits Riemannian curvature and Jacobi equations, which are discussed.</description>

      <title>A case study on different one-factor Cheyette models for short maturity caplet calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [1], we calibrated a one-factor Cheyette SLV model with a local volatility that is linear in the benchmark forward rate and an uncorrelated CIR stochastic variance to 3M caplets of various maturities. While caplet smiles for many maturities could be reasonably well calibrated across the range of strikes, for instance the 1Y maturity could not be calibrated well across that entire range of strikes. Here, we study whether models with alternative local volatility terms and/or alternative stochastic volatility or variance models can calibrate the 1Y caplet smile better across the strike range better than the model studied in [1]. This is made possible and feasible by the generic simulation, pricing, and calibration frameworks introduced in [1] and some new frameworks presented in this paper. We find that some model settings calibrate well to the 1Y smile across the strike range under study. In particular, a model setting with a local volatility that is piece-wise linear in the benchmark forward rate together with an uncorrelated CIR stochastic variance and one with a local volatility that is linear in the benchmark rate together with a correlated lognormal stochastic volatility with quadratic drift (QDLNSV) as in [2] calibrate well. We discuss why the later might be a preferable model.

      <title>Practical Aspects on Solving Differential Equations Using Deep Learning: A Primer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has become a popular tool across many scientific fields, including the study of differential equations, particularly partial differential equations. This work introduces the basic principles of deep learning and the Deep Galerkin method, which uses deep neural networks to solve differential equations. This primer aims to provide technical and practical insights into the Deep Galerkin method and its implementation. We demonstrate how to solve the one-dimensional heat equation step-by-step. We also show how to apply the Deep Galerkin method to solve systems of ordinary differential equations and integral equations, such as the Fredholm of the second kind. Additionally, we provide code snippets within the text and the complete source code on Github. The examples are designed so that one can run them on a simple computer without needing a GPU.</description>

      <title>Dominant subspace and low-rank approximations from block Krylov subspaces without a prescribed gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel convergence analysis of the classical deterministic block Krylov methods for the approximation of $h$-dimensional dominant subspaces and low-rank approximations of matrices $ A\in\mathbb K^{m\times n}$ (where $\mathbb K=\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C)$ in the case that there is no singular gap at the index $h$ i.e., if $\sigma_h=\sigma_{h+1}$ (where $\sigma_1\geq \ldots\geq \sigma_p\geq 0$ denote the singular values of $ A$, and $p=\min\{m,n\}$). Indeed, starting with a (deterministic) matrix $ X\in\mathbb K^{n\times r}$ with $r\geq h$ satisfying a compatibility assumption with some $h$-dimensional right dominant subspace of $A$, we show that block Krylov methods produce arbitrarily good approximations for both problems mentioned above. Our approach is based on recent work by Drineas, Ipsen, Kontopoulou and Magdon-Ismail on the approximation of structural left dominant subspaces. The main difference between our work and previous work on this topic is that instead of exploiting a singular gap at the prescribed index $h$ (which is zero in this case) we exploit the nearest existing singular gaps.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical models of protein-protein dynamics, such as the heterodimer model, play a crucial role in understanding many physical phenomena. This model is a system of two semilinear parabolic partial differential equations describing the evolution and mutual interaction of biological species. An example is the neurodegenerative disease progression in some significant pathologies, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, characterized by the accumulation and propagation of toxic prionic proteins. This article presents and analyzes a flexible high-order discretization method for the numerical approximation of the heterodimer model. We propose a space discretization based on a Discontinuous Galerkin method on polygonal/polyhedral grids, which provides flexibility in handling complex geometries. Concerning the semi-discrete formulation, we prove stability and a-priori error estimates for the first time. Next, we adopt a $\theta$-method scheme as a time integration scheme. Convergence tests are carried out to demonstrate the theoretical bounds and the ability of the method to approximate traveling wave solutions, considering also complex geometries such as brain sections reconstructed from medical images. Finally, the proposed scheme is tested in a practical test case stemming from neuroscience applications, namely the simulation of the spread of $\alpha$-synuclein in a realistic test case of Parkinson's disease in a two-dimensional sagittal brain section geometry reconstructed from medical images.</description>

      <title>A priori analysis of a tensor ROM for parameter dependent parabolic problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A space-time-parameters structure of parametric parabolic PDEs motivates the application of tensor methods to define reduced order models (ROMs). Within a tensor-based ROM framework, the matrix SVD - a traditional dimension reduction technique - yields to a low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTD). Such tensor extension of the Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition ROMs (POD-ROMs) benefits both the practical efficiency of the ROM and its amenability for rigorous error analysis when applied to parametric PDEs. The paper addresses the error analysis of the Galerkin LRTD-ROM for an abstract linear parabolic problem that depends on multiple physical parameters. An error estimate for the LRTD-ROM solution is proved, which is uniform with respect to problem parameters and extends to parameter values not in a sampling/training set. The estimate is given in terms of discretization and sampling mesh properties, and LRTD accuracy. The estimate depends on the local smoothness rather than on the Kolmogorov n-widths of the parameterized manifold of solutions. Theoretical results are illustrated with several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Spline-Based Stochastic Collocation Methods for Uncertainty Quantification in Nonlinear Hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic collocation (SC) methods for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in hyperbolic systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In these methods, the underlying PDEs are numerically solved at a set of collocation points in random space. A standard SC approach is based on a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion, which relies on choosing the collocation points based on the prescribed probability distribution and approximating the computed solution by a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials in the random variable. We demonstrate that this approach struggles to accurately capture discontinuous solutions, often leading to oscillations (Gibbs phenomenon) that deviate significantly from the physical solutions. We explore alternative SC methods, in which one can choose an arbitrary set of collocation points and employ shape-preserving splines to interpolate the solution in a random space. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of spline-based collocation in accurately capturing and assessing uncertainties while suppressing oscillations. We illustrate the superiority of the spline-based collocation on two numerical examples, including the inviscid Burgers and shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Entrywise tensor-train approximation of large tensors via random embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of low-rank tensor-train approximation is well-understood when the approximation error is measured in the Frobenius norm. The entrywise maximum norm is equally important but is significantly weaker for large tensors, making the estimates obtained via the Frobenius norm and norm equivalence pessimistic or even meaningless. In this article, we derive a direct estimate of the entrywise approximation error that is applicable in some of these cases. The estimate is given in terms of the higher-order generalization of the matrix factorization norm, and its proof is based on the tensor-structured Hanson-Wright inequality. The theoretical results are accompanied with numerical experiments carried out with the method of alternating projections.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for nonlinear Kolmogorov PDEs via sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine nonlinear Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs). Here the nonlinear part of the PDE comes from its Hamiltonian where one maximizes over all possible drift and diffusion coefficients which fall within a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of pre-specified baseline coefficients. Our goal is to quantify and compute how sensitive those PDEs are to such a small nonlinearity, and then use the results to develop an efficient numerical method for their approximation. We show that as $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$, the nonlinear Kolmogorov PDE equals the linear Kolmogorov PDE defined with respect to the corresponding baseline coefficients plus $\varepsilon$ times a correction term which can be also characterized by the solution of another linear Kolmogorov PDE involving the baseline coefficients. As these linear Kolmogorov PDEs can be efficiently solved in high-dimensions by exploiting their Feynman-Kac representation, our derived sensitivity analysis then provides a Monte Carlo based numerical method which can efficiently solve these nonlinear Kolmogorov equations. We establish an error and complexity analysis for our numerical method. Moreover, we provide numerical examples in up to 100 dimensions to empirically demonstrate the applicability of our numerical method.</description>

      <title>A sequential multilinear Nystr\"om algorithm for streaming low-rank approximation of tensors in Tucker format</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a sequential version of the multilinear Nystr\"om algorithm which is suitable for the low-rank Tucker approximation of tensors given in a streaming format. Accessing the tensor $\mathcal{A}$ exclusively through random sketches of the original data, the algorithm effectively leverages structures in $\mathcal{A}$, such as low-rankness, and linear combinations. We present a deterministic analysis of the algorithm and demonstrate its superior speed and efficiency in numerical experiments including an application in video processing.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic error analysis of limited-precision stochastic rounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical probabilistic rounding error analysis is particularly well suited to stochastic rounding (SR), and it yields strong results when dealing with floating-point algorithms that rely heavily on summation. For many numerical linear algebra algorithms, one can prove probabilistic error bounds that grow as O(nu), where n is the problem size and u is the unit roundoff. These probabilistic bounds are asymptotically tighter than the worst-case ones, which grow as O(nu). For certain classes of algorithms, SR has been shown to be unbiased. However, all these results were derived under the assumption that SR is implemented exactly, which typically requires a number of random bits that is too large to be suitable for practical implementations. We investigate the effect of the number of random bits on the probabilistic rounding error analysis of SR. To this end, we introduce a new rounding mode, limited-precision SR. By taking into account the number r of random bits used, this new rounding mode matches hardware implementations accurately, unlike the ideal SR operator generally used in the literature. We show that this new rounding mode is biased and that the bias is a function of r. As r approaches infinity, however, the bias disappears, and limited-precision SR converges to the ideal, unbiased SR operator. We develop a novel model for probabilistic error analysis of algorithms employing SR. Several numerical examples corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Framework for uncertainty quantification of wave-structure interaction in a flume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a numerical procedure for the quantification of uncertainties in wave-structure interaction. We utilise the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme for modelling the wave mechanics, coupled one-way with a finite element method (FEM) for the structural response. Physical wave flumes are extensively used in the study of hydrodynamics especially in wave-structure interaction (WSI) and prediction of forces to near-shore structures in disaster mitigation and offshore structures in the oil and gas, and more recently renewable energy sector. Over the years, numerical wave flumes have been developed extensively to enable the modelling of complex wave-structure interaction. However, most of these studies are deterministic and limited to using either simple flexible beams or rigid monolithic structures to model the structural part in the WSI. Additionally, uncertainties are commonly observed in both wave and structural parameters and need to be accounted for. This work presents a numerical framework to enable uncertainty quantification for wave-structure interaction problems in terms of the forces experienced by the structure. A one-way coupling between SPH with the FEM and uncertainty quantification (UQ) is proposed. We employ the so-called Tokyo wave flume geometry, which has potential for future surrogate modelling in WSI. The developed model is validated using numerical and experimental results from the literature and is used to demonstrate the prediction of probabilistic responses of structures under breaking and non-breaking wave scenarios.</description>

      <title>Operator SVD with Neural Networks via Nested Low-Rank Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a given linear operator, or finding its leading eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is a fundamental task in many machine learning and scientific computing problems. For high-dimensional eigenvalue problems, training neural networks to parameterize the eigenfunctions is considered as a promising alternative to the classical numerical linear algebra techniques. This paper proposes a new optimization framework based on the low-rank approximation characterization of a truncated singular value decomposition, accompanied by new techniques called \emph{nesting} for learning the top-$L$ singular values and singular functions in the correct order. The proposed method promotes the desired orthogonality in the learned functions implicitly and efficiently via an unconstrained optimization formulation, which is easy to solve with off-the-shelf gradient-based optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework for use cases in computational physics and machine learning.</description>
