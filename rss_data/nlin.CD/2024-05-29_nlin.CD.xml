      <title>Stochastic Continuation of Trajectories in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem via Differential Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical continuation techniques are powerful tools that have been extensively used to identify particular solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems and enable trajectory design in chaotic astrodynamics problems such as the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem. However, the applicability of equilibrium points and periodic orbits may be questionable in real-world applications where the uncertainties of the initial conditions of the spacecraft and dynamical parameters of the problem (e.g., mass ratio parameter) are taken into consideration. Due to uncertain parameters and initial conditions, the spacecraft might not follow the reference periodic orbit owing to growing uncertainties that cause the satellite to deviate from its nominal path. Hence, it is crucial to keep track of the probability of finding the spacecraft in a given region. Building on previous work, we extend numerical continuation to moments of the distribution (i.e., stochastic continuation) by directly continuing moments of the probability density function of the spacecraft state. Only assuming normality of the initial conditions, and leveraging moment-generating functions, Isserlis' theorem, and the algebra of truncated polynomials, we propagate the distribution of the spacecraft state at consecutive surface of section crossings while retaining a symbolic map of the final moments of the distribution that depend on the initial mean and covariance matrix only. The goal of the work is to offer a differential algebra-based general framework to continue 3D periodic orbits in the presence of uncertain dynamical systems. The proposed approach is compared against traditional Monte Carlo simulations to validate the uncertainty propagation approach and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed in terms of uncertainty propagation computational burden and access to higher-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization for Trajectory Design via Invariant Manifolds in the Earth-Moon Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses optimal impulsive trajectory design within the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP), presenting a global optimization-based approach to identify minimum $\Delta V$ transfers between periodic orbits, including heteroclinic connections. By combining a Monotonic Basin Hopping (MBH) algorithm with a sequential quadratic solver in a parallel optimization framework, a wide range of minimum $\Delta V$ transfers are efficiently found. To validate this approach, known connections from the literature are reproduced. Consequently, three-dimensional periodic orbits are explored and a systematic search for minimum propellant trajectories is conducted within a selected interval of Jacobi constants and a maximum time of flight. Analysis of the results reveals the presence of very low $\Delta V$ solutions and showcases the algorithm's effectiveness across various mission scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cognitive biases can move opinion dynamics from consensus to signatures of transient chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in how democracies form consensus has increased recently, with statistical physics and economics approaches both suggesting that there is convergence to a fixed point in belief networks, but with fluctuations in opinions when there are ``stubborn'' voters. We modify a model of opinion dynamics in which agents are fully Bayesian to account for two cognitive biases: confirmation bias and in-group bias. Confirmation bias occurs when the received information is considered to be more likely when it aligns with the receiver's beliefs. In-group bias occurs when the receiver further considers the information to be more likely when the receiver's beliefs and the sender's beliefs are aligned. We find that when there are no cognitive biases, a network of agents always converges to complete consensus. With confirmation bias alone, polarization can occur. With both biases present, consensus and polarization are possible, but when agents attempt to counteract confirmation bias, there can be signatures of transient chaos and ongoing opinion fluctuations. Based on this simple model, we conjecture that complex opinion fluctuations might be a generic feature of opinion dynamics when agents are Bayesian with biases.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>
