      <title>Models of $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every point in a uniformly $2$-nondegenerate CR hypersurface is canonically associated with a model $2$-nondegenerate structure. The $2$-nondegenerate models are basic CR invariants playing the same fundamental role as quadrics do in the Levi nondegenerate case. We characterize all $2$-nondegenerate models and show that the moduli space of such hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^N$ is infinite dimensional for each $N&gt;3$. We derive a normal form for these models' defining equations that is unique up to an action of a finite dimensional Lie group. We generalize recently introduced CR invariants termed modified symbols, and show how to compute these intrinsically defined invariants from a model's defining equation. We show that these models automatically possess infinitesimal symmetries spanning a complement to their Levi kernel and derive explicit formulas for them.</description>

      <title>Modular Vector Fields for Lattice Polarized K3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a moduli space of lattice polarized K3 surfaces with the additional information of a frame of the trascendental cohomology with respect to the lattice polarization. This moduli space is proved to be quasi-affine, and the existence of vector fields on it, called modular vector fields, is proved. A purely algebraic version of the algebra of Siegel quasi-modular forms is obtained as the algebra of global regular functions over this moduli space, with a differential structure coming from the modular vector fields. By means of trascendental considerations we are able to obtain a differential algebra of meromorphic Siegel quasi-modular forms from the previous algebra.</description>

      <title>Twisted Adiabatic Limit for Complex Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complex manifold $X$ and a smooth positive function $\eta$ thereon, we perturb the standard differential operator $d=\partial + \bar\partial$ acting on differential forms to a first-order differential operator $D_\eta$ whose principal part is $\eta\partial + \bar\partial$. The role of the zero-th order part is to force the integrability property $D_\eta^2=0$ that leads to a cohomology isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of $X$, while the components of types $(0,\,1)$ and $(1,\,0)$ of $D_\eta$ induce cohomologies isomorphic to the Dolbeault and conjugate-Dolbeault cohomologies. We compute Bochner-Kodaira-Nakano-type formulae for the Laplacians induced by these operators and a given Hermitian metric on $X$. The computations throw up curvature-like operators of order one that can be made (semi-)positive under appropriate assumptions on the function $\eta$. As applications, we obtain vanishing results for certain harmonic spaces on complete, non-compact, manifolds and for the Dolbeault cohomology of compact complex manifolds that carry certain types of functions $\eta$. This study continues and generalises the one of the operators $d_h=h\partial + \bar\partial$ that we introduced and investigated recently for a positive constant $h$ that was then let to converge to $0$ and, more generally, for constants $h\in\C$. The operators $d_h$ had, in turn, been adapted to complex structures from the well-known adiabatic limit construction for Riemannian foliations. Allowing now for possibly non-constant functions $\eta$ creates positivity in the curvature-like operator that stands one in good stead for various kinds of applications.</description>

      <title>On metric equivalence of the Brieskorn-Pham hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that two bi-Lipschitz equivalent Brieskorn-Pham hypersurfaces have the same multiplicities at $0$. Moreover we show that if two algebraic $(n-1)$-dimensional cones $P, R\subset\mathbb C^n$ with isolated singularities are homeomorphic, then they have the same degree.</description>

      <title>Log-Lipschitz and H\"older regularity imply smoothness for complex analytic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove metric analogues, in any dimension and in any co-dimension, of the famous Theorem of Mumford on smoothness of normal surfaces and the beautiful Theorem of Ramanujam that gives a topological characterization of $\mathbb{C}^2$ as an algebraic surface. For instance, we prove that a complex analytic set that is log-Lipschitz regular at 0 (i.e., a complex analytic set that has a neighbourhood of the origin which bi-log-Lipschitz homeomorphic to an Euclidean ball) must be smooth at 0. We prove even more, we prove that if a complex analytic set $X$ such that, for each $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, $(X,0)$ and $(\mathbb{R}^k,0)$ are bi-$\alpha$-H\"older homeomorphic, then $X$ must be smooth at 0. These results generalize the Lipschitz Regularity Theorem, which says that a Lipschitz regular complex analytic set must be smooth. Global versions of these results are also presented here and, in particular, we obtain a characterization of an affine linear subspace as a pure-dimensional entire complex analytic set.</description>

      <title>Berndtsson-Lempert-Sz\H{o}ke Fields Associated to Proper Holomorphic Families of Vector Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing on work of Berndtsson and of Lempert and Sz\H{o}ke, we define a kind of complex analytic structure for families of (possibly finite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces that might not fit together to form a holomorphic vector bundle but nevertheless have a reasonable definition of curvature that agrees with the curvature of the Chern connection when the family of Hilbert spaces is locally trivial. We thus obtain a new proof of a celebrated theorem of Berndtsson on the curvature of direct images of semi-positively twisted relative canonical bundles (i.e., adjoint bundles), and of its higher-rank generalization due to Liu and Yang.</description>

      <title>Proper maps of ball complements &amp; differences and rational sphere maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider proper holomorphic maps of complements and differences of balls in complex euclidean space of dimension at least $2$. We prove that every proper map of ball complements gives a polynomial proper map of balls, and conversely, every polynomial proper map of balls whose norm goes to infinity at infinity is a proper map of ball complements. The case of ball differences is more complex and naturally leads to what we call rational $m$-fold sphere maps, that is, rational maps taking $m$ zero-centric spheres to $m$ zero-centric spheres. A proper map of the difference of zero-centric balls is automatically a rational $2$-fold sphere map. We show that a polynomial $m$-fold sphere map of degree $m$ or less is an $\infty$-fold sphere map, that is, a map that takes infinitely many (and hence every) zero-centric spheres to zero-centric spheres. Similarly, every rational $m$-fold sphere map of degree less than $m$ is an $\infty$-fold sphere map. We then show that $\infty$-fold sphere maps are up to a unitary transformation direct sums of a finite number of homogeneous sphere maps. We construct rational $m$-fold degree-$m$ sphere maps that do not take any other zero-centric sphere to a zero-centric sphere. In particular, every first-degree rational proper map of the difference of zero-centric balls is a unitary composed with an affine linear embedding; however, there exist nonpolynomial second-degree rational maps of a difference of balls.</description>

      <title>Wold decomposition for isometries with equal range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $n \geq 2$, and let $V=(V_1,\dots, V_n)$ be an $n$-tuple of isometries acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. We say that $V$ is an $n$-tuple of isometries with equal range if $V_i^{m_i}V_j^{m_j}\mathcal{H} = V_j^{m_j} V_i^{m_i}\mathcal{H}$ and $V_i^{*m_i}V_j^{m_j} \mathcal{H} = V_j^{m_j} V_i^{*m_i}\mathcal{H}$ for $m_i,m_j \in \mathbb{Z}_+$, where $1 \leq i&lt;j \leq n$.
  We prove that each $n$-tuple of isometries with equal range admits a unique Wold decomposition. We obtain analytic models of the above class, and as a consequence, we show that the wandering data are complete unitary invariants for $n$-tuples of isometries with equal range. Our results unify all prior findings on the decomposition for tuples of isometries in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Prime orbit theorems for expanding Thurston maps: Dirichlet series and orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain an analog of the prime number theorem for a class of branched covering maps on the $2$-sphere $S^2$ called expanding Thurston maps, which are topological models of some non-uniformly expanding rational maps without any smoothness or holomorphicity assumptions. More precisely, we show that the number of primitive periodic orbits, ordered by a weight on each point induced by an (eventually) positive real-valued H\"{o}lder continuous function on $S^2$ that is not cohomologous to a constant, is asymptotically the same as the well-known logarithmic integral. In particular, our results apply to postcritically-finite rational maps for which the Julia set is the whole Riemann sphere.</description>
