      <title>Approximating Continuous Motions of Geometric Constraint Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization space of geometric constraint systems is given by the vanishing locus of polynomials corresponding to natural geometric constraints. Such geometric constraint systems arise in many real-world scenarios such as structural engineering and soft matter physics. When a geometric constraint system is flexible, it admits continuous deformations. The ability to explicitly compute such continuous motions is essential for analyzing the constraint system's quasistatic or elastic properties. However, this task is computationally challenging, even for comparatively simple geometric constraint systems, making numerical strategies attractive.
  In this article, we present a general numerical framework for approximating continuous motions of geometric constraint systems given by quadratic polynomials. Our approach combines Riemannian optimization with numerical algebraic geometry to construct continuous motions via the metric projection onto the constraint set. By using homotopy continuation, we ensure that the computed motions correspond to genuine solutions of the constraint system and avoid numerical artifacts such as path-jumping. To handle singularities and over-determined systems, we introduce theoretical enhancements including randomization, adaptive step size control and a second-order analysis. These methods are implemented in the Julia package DeformationPaths.jl, which supports a broad class of geometric constraint systems and demonstrates its robust and effective performance across a wide range of test cases.</description>

      <title>Operatopes, Operanoids, and Noncommutative Zonoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of convex bodies called operatopes that are obtained by taking Minkowski sums of affine images of an operator norm ball. This notion generalizes that of zonotopes which are Minkowksi sums of line segments. Taking the limit of the number of line segments to infinity yields the class of convex bodies called zonoids, which can also be viewed as the expectation of a random line segment. Expanding on this interpretation, we analogously define operanoids as the expectation of a random affine image of an operator norm ball. In studying the properties of operanoids when the dimension of the operator norm ball grows, we arrive at a new asymptotic regime for limits of convex bodies. This leads to the more general class of convex bodies called noncommutative zonoids, and we use the framework of free probability theory to illustrate basic properties and examples. Finally, we discuss applications of operanoids and noncommutative zonoids in statistics and stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Generalised lower Assouad-type dimensions and their interpolations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the analytic and structural properties of the $\phi$-lower Assouad dimension, a generalized notion extending the lower Assouad dimension. We establish the equivalence of $\phi$-lower Assouad dimensions with respect to the dimension functions, prove analytic properties related to the regularity of the $\phi$-lower dimension, and analyse the role of rate windows in this context. Furthermore, we explore both positive and negative interpolation properties of the $\phi$-lower dimension by presenting corresponding theorems that delineate these behaviors.</description>

      <title>Multiple convolutions and multilinear fractal Fourier extension estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08568v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Stein--Tomas theorem extends the theory of linear Fourier restriction estimates from smooth manifolds to fractal measures exhibiting Fourier decay. In the multilinear setting, transversality allows for Fourier extension estimates that go beyond those implied by the linear theory to hold. We establish a multilinear Fourier extension estimate for measures whose convolution belongs to an $L^p$ space, applicable to known results by Shmerkin and Solomyak that exploit `transversality' between self-similar measures. Moreover, we generalise work by Hambrook--{\L}aba and Chen from the linear setting to obtain Knapp-type examples for multilinear estimates; we obtain two necessary conditions: one in terms of the upper box dimension of the measures' supports, and another one in terms of their Fourier decay and a ball condition. In particular, these conditions give a more restrictive range compared with previously known results whenever the convolution of the measures at play is singular.</description>

      <title>Random Polyhedral Cones: Distributional Results via Gale Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $U_1,\ldots,U_n$ be independent random vectors uniformly distributed on the unit sphere $\mathbb S^{d-1}\subseteq\mathbb R^d$, where $n\ge d$, and consider the random polyhedral cone \[ \mathcal W_{n,d}:=\mathop{\mathrm{pos}} (U_1,\ldots,U_n) = \{\lambda_1 U_1+ \ldots + \lambda_n U_n: \lambda_1\geq 0, \ldots, \lambda_n \geq 0\}. \] We establish several distributional results for $\mathcal W_{n,d}$ and the associated spherical polytope $\mathcal W_{n,d}\cap\mathbb S^{d-1}$. Our main contributions include:
  (i) Let $\alpha_d$ denote the solid angle of $\mathcal W_{d,d}$ and write $m(d,k):=\mathbb E[\alpha_d^k]$ for its $k$-th moment. We prove the symmetry $m(d,k)=m(k,d)$. As an application, we compute $\mathop{\mathrm{Var}}[\alpha_d]=2^{-d}(d+1)^{-1}-4^{-d}$ and derive a closed formula for the third moment.
  (ii) For $n=d+1,d+2,d+3$ we determine the probability that $\mathcal W_{n,d}\cap\mathbb S^{d-1}$ is a spherical simplex, a spherical analogue of the classical Sylvester problem. In the case $n=d+2$ we also determine the distribution of the number of vertices of $\mathcal W_{d+2,d}\cap\mathbb S^{d-1}$.
  (iii) Let $f_\ell(\mathcal W_{n,d})$ denote the number of $\ell$-dimensional faces of $\mathcal W_{n,d}$. We prove a distributional limit theorem for $f_\ell(\mathcal W_{n,d})$ in the regime $n=d+k$ and $\ell=d-q$, where $k,q\in\mathbb N$ are fixed and $d\to\infty$. The limit law is a weighted sum of independent chi squared variables, with weights given by explicit eigenvalues of a convolution operator on the sphere.
  A unifying ingredient is an explicit coupling producing i.i.d. uniform vectors $U_1,\ldots,U_n\in\mathbb S^{d-1}$ together with i.i.d. uniform vectors $V_1,\ldots,V_n\in\mathbb S^{n-d-1}$ whose associated oriented matroids are Gale dual.</description>

      <title>Complete discrete Schoenberg-Delsarte theory for homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of partially defined complete positivity preservers, extending Schoenberg's classical characterization to functions defined only on discrete subsets or constrained domains. We frame the extension problem through the theory of completely positive maps on operator systems -- we characterize general partially defined completely positive definite functions on general homogeneous spaces. We apply our interpolation to constrained packing problems and Delsarte theory, where one uses positive definite functions on homogeneous spaces to obtain bounds on various packing problems. We prove the specific positive definite function witnesses that a code is sharp for constrained angle codes must be from polynomials.</description>

      <title>On prescribing total preorders and linear orders to pairwise distances of points in Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any total preorder on a set with $\binom{n}{2}$ elements coincides with the order on pairwise distances of some point collection of size $n$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. For linear orders, a collection of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^{n-2}$ suffices. These bounds turn out to be optimal. We also find an optimal bound in a bipartite version for total preorders and a near-optimal bound for a bipartite version for linear orders. Our arguments include tools from convexity and positive semidefinite quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bordism over acyclic groups and Cheeger-Gromov $\rho$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a solution to a bordism version of Gromov's linearity problem over a large family of acyclic groups, for manifolds with arbitrary dimension. Every group embeds into some acyclic group in this family. Thus, the linear bordism problem has an affirmative solution over a possibly enlarged acyclic group. Our result holds in both PL and smooth categories, and for both oriented and unoriented cases. In the PL case, our results hold without assuming bounded local geometry. As an application, we prove that there is a universal linear bound for the Cheeger-Gromov $L^2$ $\rho$-invariants of PL $(4k-1)$-manifolds associated with arbitrary regular covers. We also show that the minimum number of simplices in a PL triangulation of $(4k-1)$-manifolds with a fixed simple homotopy type is unbounded if the fundamental group has nontrivial torsion. The proof of our main results builds on quantitative algebraic and geometric techniques over the simplicial classifying spaces of groups.</description>

      <title>Fast and Stable Riemannian Metrics on SPD Manifolds via Cholesky Product Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix learning show that Riemannian metrics are fundamental to effective SPD neural networks. Motivated by this, we revisit the geometry of the Cholesky factors and uncover a simple product structure that enables convenient metric design. Building on this insight, we propose two fast and stable SPD metrics, Power--Cholesky Metric (PCM) and Bures--Wasserstein--Cholesky Metric (BWCM), derived via Cholesky decomposition. Compared with existing SPD metrics, the proposed metrics provide closed-form operators, computational efficiency, and improved numerical stability. We further apply our metrics to construct Riemannian Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) classifiers and residual blocks for SPD neural networks. Experiments on SPD deep learning, numerical stability analyses, and tensor interpolation demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/PCM_BWCM.</description>

      <title>Infinity Search: Approximate Vector Search with Projections on q-Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ultrametric space or infinity-metric space is defined by a dissimilarity function that satisfies a strong triangle inequality in which every side of a triangle is not larger than the larger of the other two. We show that search in ultrametric spaces with a vantage point tree has worst-case complexity equal to the depth of the tree. Since datasets of interest are not ultrametric in general, we employ a projection operator that transforms an arbitrary dissimilarity function into an ultrametric space while preserving nearest neighbors. We further learn an approximation of this projection operator to efficiently compute ultrametric distances between query points and points in the dataset. We proceed to solve a more general problem in which we consider projections in $q$-metric spaces -- in which triangle sides raised to the power of $q$ are smaller than the sum of the $q$-powers of the other two. Notice that the use of learned approximations of projected $q$-metric distances renders the search pipeline approximate. We show in experiments that increasing values of $q$ result in faster search but lower recall. Overall, search in q-metric and infinity metric spaces is competitive with existing search methods.</description>

      <title>Translation invariant curvature measures of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a series of papers, Weil initiated the investigation of translation invariant curvature measures of convex bodies, which include as prime examples Federer's curvature measures. In this paper, we continue this line of research by introducing new tools to study curvature measures. Our main results suggest that the space of curvature measures, which is graded by degree and parity, is highly structured: We conjecture that each graded component has length at most $2$ as a representation of the general linear group, and we prove this in degrees $0$ and $n-2$. Beyond this conjectural picture, our methods yield a characterization of Federer's curvature measures under weaker assumptions.</description>
