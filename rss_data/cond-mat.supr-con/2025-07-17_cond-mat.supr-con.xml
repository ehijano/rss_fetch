      <title>Impact of electronic correlations on the superconductivity of high-pressure CeH9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth superhydrides have attracted considerable attention because of their high critical superconducting temperature under extreme pressures. They are known to have localized valence electrons, implying strong electronic correlations. However, such many-body effects are rarely included in first-principles studies of rare-earth superhydrides because of the complexity of their high-pressure phases. In this work, we use a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory approach to study both electrons and phonons in the prototypical rare-earth superhydride CeH$_9$, shedding light on the impact of electronic correlations on its critical temperature for phonon-mediated superconductivity. Our findings indicate that electronic correlations result in a larger electronic density at the Fermi level, a bigger superconducting gap, and softer vibrational modes associated with hydrogen atoms. Together, the inclusion of these correlation signatures increases the Migdal-Eliashberg superconducting critical temperature from 47 K to 96 K, close to the measured 95 K. Our results reconcile experimental observations and theoretical predictions for CeH$_9$ and herald a path towards the quantitative modeling of phonon-mediated superconductivity for interacting electron systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Josephson Supercurrent and $\pi$-Junction by Chiral Antiferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic order typically disrupts superconductivity, reducing the supercurrent. Here, we show that chiral antiferromagnetism, with non-relativistic spin-split bands and distinctive valley-locked spin texture, can instead significantly enhance Josephson supercurrents. This enhancement stems from the emergence of dominant equal-spin triplet pairing and strong fluctuations of singlet pairing in momentum space, both induced by chiral antiferromagnetism. We demonstrate these results in Josephson junctions composed of chiral antiferromagnetic metals and conventional superconductors on kagome lattices. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced Josephson supercurrent is stabilized in a $\pi$-junction state. These phenomena persist across a broad energy range and remain stable for different temperatures and junction lengths. Our results unveil a previously unexplored mechanism for enhancing supercurrent by strong magnetic order and provide crucial insights into the large Josephson currents observed in Mn$_3$Ge.</description>

      <title>A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</description>

      <title>Topology-Enhanced Superconducting Qubit Networks for In-Sensor Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for superfluid vortex lattice from coset construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential. By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Amplitude mode in a multi-gap superconductor MgB$_2$ investigated by terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the terahertz (THz) nonlinear response of the multigap superconductor MgB$_2$, using THz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (THz 2DCS). With broadband THz drive fields, we identified a nonlinear response at twice the lower superconducting gap energy $2\Delta_{\pi}$ at the lowest temperatures. Using narrow-band THz driving pulses, we observed first (FH) and third harmonic responses. The FH intensity shows a monotonic increase with decreasing temperature when properly normalized by the driving field strength. This is distinct from the single-gap superconductor NbN, where the FH signal exhibited a resonant enhancement at temperatures when twice the gap energy $2\Delta$ was resonant with the driving photon energy, which was interpreted to originate from the superconducting amplitude mode. Our results in MgB$_2$ are consistent with a well-defined amplitude mode only at the lowest temperatures and indicate strong damping as temperature increases. This likely indicates the importance of interband coupling in MgB$_2$ and its influence on the nature of the amplitude mode and its damping.</description>

      <title>Observation of Local Pairs through Nonequilibrium Terahertz Spectroscopy in YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} Below Tc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pairing states are essential to understanding the underlying mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Here the non-superconducting state in an optimally doped YBa_2 Cu_3 O_(7-{\delta}) film was driven out of equilibrium by an optical pump with low fluence at a temperature well below the critical temperature (T_c), and its recovery dynamics were exclusively measured using transient terahertz spectroscopy. The pump-fluence dependent experiments unveiled evidence of local pairs without superconductivity coexisting with the superconducting Cooper pairs. An energy gap opening induced by the local pairing with short-range coherence was invoked to rationalize the temperature-dependent recovery time of local pairs with a characteristic divergence at a temperature substantially below T_c. These local pairs displayed remarkable likeness to the short-range pair-density-wave state. Our finding sheds light on understanding the dynamic interplay between the coexisting superconducting and non-superconducting pairs in cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Magnetoresistance in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ at High Magnetic Fields of up to 100 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investigation of transport characteristics in high-temperature superconductors under magnetic fields is one of the most important topics in condensed matter physics and transport applications. For YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO), the measurements of magnetoresistance under a high magnetic field are technically challenging because the required magnetic field ($B$) to suppress the superconductivity is 100~T class. The low temperature (from 52 to 150 K) longitudinal magnetoresistance ($B$$\parallel$ab-plane$\parallel$$J$, where $J$ is an electrical current) was measured up to 103~T in optimally doped YBCO thin films. A radio frequency reflection method and the single-turn coil technique were employed. The electrical resistivity $\rho_{ab}$ exhibited a non-saturating magnetoresistance behavior until the highest field region, with the slope $\beta (=d \rho/d B)$ showing a pronounced deviation compared to the transverse magnetoresistance ($B$$\parallel$c-axis) case. These findings suggest a potential contribution due to the non-orbital origin in the high field phase of YBCO, because the quasiparticle orbital motion is expected to be absent in the longitudinal magnetoresistance.</description>
