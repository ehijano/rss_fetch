      <title>Deep Hankel matrices with random elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Willems' fundamental lemma enables a trajectory-based characterization of linear systems through data-based Hankel matrices. However, in the presence of measurement noise, we ask: Is this noisy Hankel-based model expressive enough to re-identify itself? In other words, we study the output prediction accuracy from recursively applying the same persistently exciting input sequence to the model. We find an asymptotic connection to this self-consistency question in terms of the amount of data. More importantly, we also connect this question to the depth (number of rows) of the Hankel model, showing the simple act of reconfiguring a finite dataset significantly improves accuracy. We apply these insights to find a parsimonious depth for LQR problems over the trajectory space.</description>

      <title>Designing, simulating, and performing the 100-AV field test for the CIRCLES consortium: Methodology and Implementation of the Largest mobile traffic control experiment to date</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous controlled experiments on single-lane ring roads have shown that a single partially autonomous vehicle (AV) can effectively mitigate traffic waves. This naturally prompts the question of how these findings can be generalized to field operational, high-density traffic conditions. To address this question, the Congestion Impacts Reduction via CAV-in-the-loop Lagrangian Energy Smoothing (CIRCLES) Consortium conducted MegaVanderTest (MVT), a live traffic control experiment involving 100 vehicles near Nashville, TN, USA. This article is a tutorial for developing analytical and simulation-based tools essential for designing and executing a live traffic control experiment like the MVT. It presents an overview of the proposed roadmap and various procedures used in designing, monitoring, and conducting the MVT, which is the largest mobile traffic control experiment at the time. The design process is aimed at evaluating the impact of the CIRCLES AVs on surrounding traffic. The article discusses the agent-based traffic simulation framework created for this evaluation. A novel methodological framework is introduced to calibrate this microsimulation, aiming to accurately capture traffic dynamics and assess the impact of adding 100 vehicles to existing traffic. The calibration model's effectiveness is verified using data from a six-mile section of Nashville's I-24 highway. The results indicate that the proposed model establishes an effective feedback loop between the optimizer and the simulator, thereby calibrating flow and speed with different spatiotemporal characteristics to minimize the error between simulated and real-world data. Finally, We simulate AVs in multiple scenarios to assess their effect on traffic congestion. This evaluation validates the AV routes, thereby contributing to the execution of a safe and successful live traffic control experiment via AVs.</description>

      <title>Research on OPF control of three-phase four-wire low-voltage distribution network considering uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As power systems become more complex and uncertain, low-voltage distribution networks face numerous challenges, including three-phase imbalances caused by asymmetrical loads and distributed energy resources. We propose a robust stochastic optimization (RSO) based optimal power flow (OPF) control method for three-phase, four-wire low-voltage distribution networks that consider uncertainty to address these issues. Using historical data and deep learning classification methods, the proposed method simulates optimal system behaviour without requiring communication infrastructure. The simulation results verify that the proposed method effectively controls the voltage and current amplitude while minimizing the operational cost and three-phase imbalance within acceptable limits. The proposed method shows promise for managing uncertainties and optimizing performance in low-voltage distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic fault detection and diagnosis for alkaline water electrolyzer with variational Bayesian Sparse principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrolytic hydrogen production serves as not only a vital source of green hydrogen but also a key strategy for addressing renewable energy consumption challenges. For the safe production of hydrogen through alkaline water electrolyzer (AWE), dependable process monitoring technology is essential. However, random noise can easily contaminate the AWE process data collected in industrial settings, presenting new challenges for monitoring methods. In this study, we develop the variational Bayesian sparse principal component analysis (VBSPCA) method for process monitoring. VBSPCA methods based on Gaussian prior and Laplace prior are derived to obtain the sparsity of the projection matrix, which corresponds to $\ell_2$ regularization and $\ell_1$ regularization, respectively. The correlation of dynamic latent variables is then analyzed by sparse autoregression and fault variables are diagnosed by fault reconstruction. The effectiveness of the method is verified by an industrial hydrogen production process, and the test results demonstrated that both Gaussian prior and Laplace prior based VBSPCA can effectively detect and diagnose critical faults in AWEs.</description>

      <title>Achievements, Experiences, and Lessons Learned from the European Research Infrastructure ERIGrid related to the Validation of Power and Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system operation is of vital importance and must be developed far beyond today's practice to meet future needs. Almost all European countries are facing an abrupt and very important increase of renewables with intrinsically varying yields which are difficult to predict. In addition, an increase of new types of electric loads and a reduction of traditional production from bulk generation can be observed as well. Hence, the level of complexity of system operation steadily increases. Because of these developments, the traditional power system is being transformed into a smart grid. Previous and ongoing research has tended to focus on how specific aspects of smart grids can be developed and validated, but until now there exists no integrated approach for analysing and evaluating complex smart grid configurations. To tackle these research and development needs, a pan-European research infrastructure is realized in the ERIGrid project that supports the technology development as well as the roll out of smart grid technologies and solutions. This paper provides an overview of the main results of ERIGrid which have been achieved during the last four years. Also, experiences and lessons learned are discussed and an outlook to future research needs is provided.</description>

      <title>Input-Output Specifications of Grid-Forming Functions and Data-Driven Verification Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates interoperability and performance specifications for converter interfaced generation (CIG) that can be verified using only input-output data. First, we develop decentralized conditions on frequency stability that account for network circuit dynamics and can be verified using CIG terminal dynamics and a few key network parameters. Next, we formalize performance specifications that impose requirements on the CIG disturbance response. A simple data-driven validation method is presented that enables verification of the interoperability and performance specifications for CIG using input-output data from a two-node system. Data obtained from electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are used to illustrate the proposed approach and the impact of key parameters such as inner control loop gains, network coupling strength, and controller bandwidth limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a prediction-based Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Controller for vehicles with actuation delay, applicable within heterogeneous platoons. We provide a stability analysis for the discrete-time implementation of this controller, which shows the effect of the used sampling times and can be used for selecting appropriate controller gains. The theoretical results are validated by means of experiments using full scale vehicles. This is an extended version of a paper with the same title (submitted to IFAC TDS 2024). Additional mathematical details are provided in this extended version.</description>

      <title>Showcasing Automated Vehicle Prototypes: A Collaborative Release Process to Manage and Communicate Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development and deployment of automated vehicles pose major challenges for manufacturers to this day. Whilst central questions, like the issue of ensuring a sufficient level of safety, remain unanswered, prototypes are increasingly finding their way into public traffic in urban areas. Although safety concepts for prototypes are addressed in literature, published work hardly contains any dedicated considerations on a systematic release for their operation. In this paper, we propose an incremental release process for public demonstrations of prototypes' automated driving functionality. We explicate release process requirements, derive process design decisions, and define stakeholder tasks. Furthermore, we reflect on practical insights gained through implementing the release process as part of the UNICAR$agil$ research project, in which four prototypes based on novel vehicle concepts were built and demonstrated to the public. One observation is the improved quality of internal risk communication, achieved by dismantling information asymmetries between stakeholders. Design conflicts are disclosed - providing a contribution to nurture transparency and, thereby, supporting a valid basis for release decisions. We argue that our release process meets two important requirements, as the results suggest its applicability to the domain of automated driving and its scalability to different vehicle concepts and organizational structures.</description>

      <title>Learning deep Koopman operators with convex stability constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel sufficient condition for the stability of discrete-time linear systems that can be represented as a set of piecewise linear constraints, which make them suitable for quadratic programming optimization problems. More specifically, we tackle the problem of imposing asymptotic stability to a Koopman matrix learned from data during iterative gradient descent optimization processes. We show that this sufficient condition can be decoupled by rows of the system matrix, and propose a control barrier function-based projected gradient descent to enforce gradual evolution towards the stability set by running an optimization-in-the-loop during the iterative learning process. We compare the performance of our algorithm with other two recent approaches in the literature, and show that we get close to state-of-the-art performance while providing the added flexibility of allowing the optimization problem to be further customized for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Type Map Construction via Semantics-Aware Autonomous Exploration in Unknown Indoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel semantics-aware autonomous exploration model to handle the long-standing issue: the mainstream RRT (Rapid-exploration Random Tree) based exploration models usually make the mobile robot switch frequently between different regions, leading to the excessively-repeated explorations for the same region. Our proposed semantics-aware model encourages a mobile robot to fully explore the current region before moving to the next region, which is able to avoid excessively-repeated explorations and make the exploration faster. The core idea of semantics-aware autonomous exploration model is optimizing the sampling point selection mechanism and frontier point evaluation function by considering the semantic information of regions. In addition, compared with existing autonomous exploration methods that usually construct the single-type or 2-3 types of maps, our model allows to construct four kinds of maps including point cloud map, occupancy grid map, topological map, and semantic map. To test the performance of our model, we conducted experiments in three simulated environments. The experiment results demonstrate that compared to Improved RRT, our model achieved 33.0% exploration time reduction and 39.3% exploration trajectory length reduction when maintaining &gt;98% exploration rate.</description>

      <title>Advanced simulation-based predictive modelling for solar irradiance sensor farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As solar power continues to grow and replace traditional energy sources, the need for reliable forecasting models becomes increasingly important to ensure the stability and efficiency of the grid. However, the management of these models still needs to be improved, and new tools and technologies are required to handle the deployment and control of solar facilities. This work introduces a novel framework named Cloud-based Analysis and Integration for Data Efficiency (CAIDE), designed for real-time monitoring, management, and forecasting of solar irradiance sensor farms. CAIDE is designed to manage multiple sensor farms simultaneously while improving predictive models in real-time using well-grounded Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) methodologies. The framework leverages Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to support the deployment and analysis of solar plants in dynamic environments. The system can adapt and re-train the model when given incorrect results, ensuring that forecasts remain accurate and up-to-date. Furthermore, CAIDE can be executed in sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, assuring scalability. The effectiveness of CAIDE is demonstrated in a complex scenario composed of several solar irradiance sensor farms connected to a centralized management system. Our results show that CAIDE is scalable and effective in managing and forecasting solar power production while improving the accuracy of predictive models in real time. The framework has important implications for the deployment of solar plants and the future of renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust and Interpretable EMG-based Hand Gesture Recognition using Deep Metric Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition (PR) models have been shown to generalize poorly in unconstrained environments, setting back their adoption in applications such as hand gesture control. This problem is often due to limited training data, exacerbated by the use of supervised classification frameworks that are known to be suboptimal in such settings. In this work, we propose a shift to deep metric-based meta-learning in EMG PR to supervise the creation of meaningful and interpretable representations. We use a Siamese Deep Convolutional Neural Network (SDCNN) and contrastive triplet loss to learn an EMG feature embedding space that captures the distribution of the different classes. A nearest-centroid approach is subsequently employed for inference, relying on how closely a test sample aligns with the established data distributions. We derive a robust class proximity-based confidence estimator that leads to a better rejection of incorrect decisions, i.e. false positives, especially when operating beyond the training data domain. We show our approach's efficacy by testing the trained SDCNN's predictions and confidence estimations on unseen data, both in and out of the training domain. The evaluation metrics include the accuracy-rejection curve and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the confidence distributions of accurate and inaccurate predictions. Outperforming comparable models on both metrics, our results demonstrate that the proposed meta-learning approach improves the classifier's precision in active decisions (after rejection), thus leading to better generalization and applicability.</description>

      <title>Unmasking the Role of Remote Sensors in Comfort, Energy and Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In single-zone multi-room houses (SZMRHs), temperature controls rely on a single probe near the thermostat, resulting in temperature discrepancies that cause thermal discomfort and energy waste. Augmenting smart thermostats (STs) with per-room sensors has gained acceptance by major ST manufacturers. This paper leverages additional sensory information to empirically characterize the services provided by buildings, including thermal comfort, energy efficiency, and demand response (DR). Utilizing room-level time-series data from 1,000 houses, metadata from 110,000 houses across the United States, and data from two real-world testbeds, we examine the limitations of SZMRHs and explore the potential of remote sensors. We discovered that comfortable DR durations (CDRDs) for rooms are typically 70% longer or 40% shorter than for the room with the thermostat. When averaging, rooms at the control temperature's bounds are typically deviated around -3{\deg}F to 2.5{\deg}F from the average. Moreover, in 95\% of houses, we identified rooms experiencing notably higher solar gains compared to the rest of the rooms, while 85% and 70% of houses demonstrated lower heat input and poor insulation, respectively. Lastly, it became evident that the consumption of cooling energy escalates with the increase in the number of sensors, whereas heating usage experiences fluctuations ranging from -19% to +25% This study serves as a benchmark for assessing the thermal comfort and DR services in the existing housing stock, while also highlighting the energy efficiency impacts of sensing technologies. Our approach sets the stage for more granular, precise control strategies of SZMRHs.</description>

      <title>OffRAMPS: An FPGA-based Intermediary for Analysis and Modification of Additive Manufacturing Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybersecurity threats in Additive Manufacturing (AM) are an increasing concern as AM adoption continues to grow. AM is now being used for parts in the aerospace, transportation, and medical domains. Threat vectors which allow for part compromise are particularly concerning, as any failure in these domains would have life-threatening consequences. A major challenge to investigation of AM part-compromises comes from the difficulty in evaluating and benchmarking both identified threat vectors as well as methods for detecting adversarial actions. In this work, we introduce a generalized platform for systematic analysis of attacks against and defenses for 3D printers. Our "OFFRAMPS" platform is based on the open-source 3D printer control board "RAMPS." OFFRAMPS allows analysis, recording, and modification of all control signals and I/O for a 3D printer. We show the efficacy of OFFRAMPS by presenting a series of case studies based on several Trojans, including ones identified in the literature, and show that OFFRAMPS can both emulate and detect these attacks, i.e., it can both change and detect arbitrary changes to the g-code print commands.</description>

Abstract: The Hyperspectral Thermal Imager (HyTI) is a technology demonstration mission that will obtain high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution long-wave infrared images of Earth's surface from a 6U cubesat. HyTI science requires that the pointing accuracy of the optical axis shall not exceed 2.89 arcsec over the 0.5 ms integration time due to microvibration effects (known as jitter). Two sources of vibration are a cryocooler that is added to maintain the detector at 68 K and three orthogonally placed reaction wheels that are a part of the attitude control system. Both of these parts will introduce vibrations that are propagated through to the satellite structure while imaging. Typical methods of characterizing and measuring jitter involve complex finite element methods and specialized equipment and setups. In this paper, we describe a novel method of characterizing jitter for small satellite systems that is low-cost and minimally modifies the subject's mass distribution. The metrology instrument is comprised of a laser source, a small mirror mounted via a 3D printed clamp to a jig, and a lateral effect position-sensing detector. The position-sensing detector samples 1000 Hz and can measure displacements as little as 0.15 arcsec at distances of one meter. This paper provides an experimental procedure that incrementally analyzes vibratory sources to establish causal relationships between sources and the vibratory modes they create. We demonstrate the capabilities of this metrology system and testing procedure on HyTI in the Hawaii Space Flight Lab's clean room. Results include power spectral density plots that show fundamental and higher-order vibratory modal frequencies. Results from metrology show that jitter from reaction wheels meets HyTI system requirements within 3$\sigma$.</description>

Abstract: Emerging wireless technologies with Gbps connectivity, such as the 5th generation (5G) and 6th generation (6G) of mobile networks, require improved and substantiating documentation for the wireless standards concerning the radio signals, systems, transmission environments used, and the radio frequency exposures created. Current challenges faced by the telecommunications sector include the lack of accurate, fast, low-cost, and traceable methods for manufacturers to demonstrate 5G and 6G product verifications matching customer specifications. This paper gives an update on the recent research and development activities from an EU Joint Research Project entitled metrology for emerging wireless standards (MEWS) in support of the above.</description>

      <title>Generalized Forgetting Recursive Least Squares: Stability and Robustness Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents generalized forgetting recursive least squares (GF-RLS), a generalization of recursive least squares (RLS) that encompasses many extensions of RLS as special cases. First, sufficient conditions are presented for the 1) Lyapunov stability, 2) uniform Lyapunov stability, 3) global asymptotic stability, and 4) global uniform exponential stability of parameter estimation error in GF-RLS when estimating fixed parameters without noise. Second, robustness guarantees are derived for the estimation of time-varying parameters in the presence of measurement noise and regressor noise. These robustness guarantees are presented in terms of global uniform ultimate boundedness of the parameter estimation error. A specialization of this result gives a bound to the asymptotic bias of least squares estimators in the errors-in-variables problem. Lastly, a survey is presented to show how GF-RLS can be used to analyze various extensions of RLS from the literature.</description>

      <title>Controlgym: Large-Scale Control Environments for Benchmarking Reinforcement Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce controlgym, a library of thirty-six industrial control settings, and ten infinite-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE)-based control problems. Integrated within the OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium (Gym) framework, controlgym allows direct applications of standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like stable-baselines3. Our control environments complement those in Gym with continuous, unbounded action and observation spaces, motivated by real-world control applications. Moreover, the PDE control environments uniquely allow the users to extend the state dimensionality of the system to infinity while preserving the intrinsic dynamics. This feature is crucial for evaluating the scalability of RL algorithms for control. This project serves the learning for dynamics &amp; control (L4DC) community, aiming to explore key questions: the convergence of RL algorithms in learning control policies; the stability and robustness issues of learning-based controllers; and the scalability of RL algorithms to high- and potentially infinite-dimensional systems. We open-source the controlgym project at https://github.com/xiangyuan-zhang/controlgym.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic forecasting of power system imbalance using neural network-based ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Keeping the balance between electricity generation and consumption is becoming increasingly challenging and costly, mainly due to the rising share of renewables, electric vehicles and heat pumps and electrification of industrial processes. Accurate imbalance forecasts, along with reliable uncertainty estimations, enable transmission system operators (TSOs) to dispatch appropriate reserve volumes, reducing balancing costs. Further, market parties can use these probabilistic forecasts to design strategies that exploit asset flexibility to help balance the grid, generating revenue with known risks. Despite its importance, literature regarding system imbalance (SI) forecasting is limited. Further, existing methods do not focus on situations with high imbalance magnitude, which are crucial to forecast accurately for both TSOs and market parties. Hence, we propose an ensemble of C-VSNs, which are our adaptation of variable selection networks (VSNs). Each minute, our model predicts the imbalance of the current and upcoming two quarter-hours, along with uncertainty estimations on these forecasts. We evaluate our approach by forecasting the imbalance of Belgium, where high imbalance magnitude is defined as $|$SI$| &gt; 500\,$MW (occurs 1.3% of the time in Belgium). For high imbalance magnitude situations, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by 23.4% (in terms of continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), which evaluates probabilistic forecasts), while also attaining a 6.5% improvement in overall CRPS. Similar improvements are achieved in terms of root-mean-squared error. Additionally, we developed a fine-tuning methodology to effectively include new inputs with limited history in our model. This work was performed in collaboration with Elia (the Belgian TSO) to further improve their imbalance forecasts, demonstrating the relevance of our work.</description>

      <title>Safe Zeroth-Order Optimization Using Quadratic Local Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses black-box smooth optimization problems, where the objective and constraint functions are not explicitly known but can be queried. The main goal of this work is to generate a sequence of feasible points converging towards a KKT primal-dual pair. Assuming to have prior knowledge on the smoothness of the unknown objective and constraints, we propose a novel zeroth-order method that iteratively computes quadratic approximations of the constraint functions, constructs local feasible sets and optimizes over them. Under some mild assumptions, we prove that this method returns an $\eta$-KKT pair (a property reflecting how close a primal-dual pair is to the exact KKT condition) within $O({1}/{\eta^{2}})$ iterations. Moreover, we numerically show that our method can achieve faster convergence compared with some state-of-the-art zeroth-order approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is also illustrated by applying it to nonconvex optimization problems in optimal control and power system operation.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic wind power forecasting resilient to missing values: an adaptive quantile regression approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic wind power forecasting approaches have significantly advanced in recent decades. However, forecasters often assume data completeness and overlook the challenge of missing values resulting from sensor failures, network congestion, etc. Traditionally, this issue is addressed during the data preprocessing procedure using methods such as deletion and imputation. Nevertheless, these ad-hoc methods pose challenges to probabilistic wind power forecasting at both parameter estimation and operational forecasting stages. In this paper, we propose a resilient probabilistic forecasting approach that smoothly adapts to missingness patterns without requiring preprocessing or retraining. Specifically, we design an adaptive quantile regression model with parameters capable of adapting to missing patterns, comprising two modules. The first is a feature extraction module where weights are kept static and biases are designed as a function of missingness patterns. The second is a non-crossing quantile neural network module, ensuring monotonicity of quantiles, with higher quantiles derived by adding non-negative amounts to lower quantiles. The proposed approach is applicable to cases under all missingness mechanisms including missing-not-at-random cases. Case studies demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of the continuous ranked probability score, with acceptable computational cost.</description>

      <title>On stability and state-norm estimation of switched systems under restricted switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the analysis of input/output-to-state stability (IOSS) and construction of state-norm estimators for continuous-time switched nonlinear systems under restricted switching. Our contributions are twofold. First, given a family of systems, possibly containing unstable dynamics, a set of admissible switches between the subsystems and admissible minimum and maximum dwell times on the subsystems, we identify a class of switching signals that obeys the given restrictions and preserves IOSS of the resulting switched system. Second, we design a class of state-norm estimators for switched systems under our class of stabilizing switching signals. These estimators are switched systems themselves with two subsystems -- one stable and one unstable. The key apparatus for our analysis is multiple Lyapunov-like functions. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the results.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Prediction-Correction Method for Distributed Consensus Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the realm of industrial technology, optimization methods play a pivotal role and are extensively applied across various sectors, including transportation engineering, robotics, and machine learning. With the surge in data volumes, there is an increasing demand for solving large-scale problems, which in turn has spurred the development of distributed optimization methods. These methods rely on the collaborative efforts of numerous dispersed devices to achieve the collective goals of the system. This study focuses on the exploration of distributed consensus optimization problems with convex set constraints within networks. The paper introduces a novel Adaptive Projection Prediction-Correction Method (PPCM), inspired by the proximal point algorithm and incorporating the theory of variational inequalities. As a contraction algorithm with notable convergence performance, PPCM is particularly suited for decentralized network environments. Moreover, the selection of parameters for this method is both straightforward and intuitive, avoiding the complexities of intricate parameter tuning. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical testing have validated the effectiveness of PPCM. When applied to problems such as distributed linear least squares, logistic regression, and support vector machines, PPCM demonstrates superior performance, achieving computation speeds over ten times faster than built-in Python functions while maintaining high precision. In conclusion, this research provides a valuable distributed consensus optimization technique, both theoretically and practically.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of a Simple Quaternion Estimator: Proof of the Bias and Covariance Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reference [1] introduces a novel closed-form quaternion estimator from two vector observations. The simplicity of the estimator enables clear physical insights and a closed-form expression for the bias as a function of the quaternion error covariance matrix. The latter could be approximated up to second order with respect to the underlying measurement noise assuming arbitrary probability distribution. The current note relaxes the second-order assumption and provides an expression for the error covariance that is exact to the fourth order, under the assumption of Gaussian distribution. This not only provides increased accuracy but also alleviates issues related to singularity. This technical note presents a comprehensive derivation of the individual components of the quaternion additive error covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Risk-Calibrated Human-Robot Interaction via Set-Valued Intent Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tasks where robots must anticipate human intent, such as navigating around a cluttered home or sorting everyday items, are challenging because they exhibit a wide range of valid actions that lead to similar outcomes. Moreover, zero-shot cooperation between human-robot partners is an especially challenging problem because it requires the robot to infer and adapt on the fly to a latent human intent, which could vary significantly from human to human. Recently, deep learned motion prediction models have shown promising results in predicting human intent but are prone to being confidently incorrect. In this work, we present Risk-Calibrated Interactive Planning (RCIP), which is a framework for measuring and calibrating risk associated with uncertain action selection in human-robot cooperation, with the fundamental idea that the robot should ask for human clarification when the risk associated with the uncertainty in the human's intent cannot be controlled. RCIP builds on the theory of set-valued risk calibration to provide a finite-sample statistical guarantee on the cumulative loss incurred by the robot while minimizing the cost of human clarification in complex multi-step settings. Our main insight is to frame the risk control problem as a sequence-level multi-hypothesis testing problem, allowing efficient calibration using a low-dimensional parameter that controls a pre-trained risk-aware policy. Experiments across a variety of simulated and real-world environments demonstrate RCIP's ability to predict and adapt to a diverse set of dynamic human intents.</description>

      <title>TOP-Nav: Legged Navigation Integrating Terrain, Obstacle and Proprioception Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legged navigation is typically examined within open-world, off-road, and challenging environments. In these scenarios, estimating external disturbances requires a complex synthesis of multi-modal information. This underlines a major limitation in existing works that primarily focus on avoiding obstacles. In this work, we propose TOP-Nav, a novel legged navigation framework that integrates a comprehensive path planner with Terrain awareness, Obstacle avoidance and close-loop Proprioception. TOP-Nav underscores the synergies between vision and proprioception in both path and motion planning. Within the path planner, we present and integrate a terrain estimator that enables the robot to select waypoints on terrains with higher traversability while effectively avoiding obstacles. In the motion planning level, we not only implement a locomotion controller to track the navigation commands, but also construct a proprioception advisor to provide motion evaluations for the path planner. Based on the close-loop motion feedback, we make online corrections for the vision-based terrain and obstacle estimations. Consequently, TOP-Nav achieves open-world navigation that the robot can handle terrains or disturbances beyond the distribution of prior knowledge and overcomes constraints imposed by visual conditions. Building upon extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments, TOP-Nav demonstrates superior performance in open-world navigation compared to existing methods.</description>
