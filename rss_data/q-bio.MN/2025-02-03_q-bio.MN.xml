      <title>A network-driven framework for enhancing gene-disease association studies in coronary artery disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases. These associations have the potential to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases and lead to the identification of novel drug targets. Despite these advancements, the biological pathways and mechanisms linking genetic variants to complex diseases are still not fully understood. Most trait-associated variants reside in non-coding regions and are presumed to influence phenotypes through regulatory effects on gene expression. Yet, it is often unclear which genes they regulate and in which cell types this regulation occurs. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) aim to bridge this gap by detecting trait-associated tissue gene expression regulated by GWAS variants. However, traditional TWAS approaches frequently overlook the critical contributions of trans-regulatory effects and fail to integrate comprehensive regulatory networks. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages tissue-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to integrate cis- and trans-genetic regulatory effects into the TWAS framework for complex diseases. We validate our approach using coronary artery disease (CAD), utilizing data from the STARNET project, which provides multi-tissue gene expression and genetic data from around 600 living patients with cardiovascular disease. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our GRN-driven framework to uncover more genes and pathways that may underlie CAD. This framework extends traditional TWAS methodologies by utilizing tissue-specific regulatory insights and advancing the understanding of complex disease genetic architecture.</description>

      <title>Quantifying energy landscape of high-dimensional oscillatory systems by diffusion decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional networks producing oscillatory dynamics are ubiquitous in biological systems. Unravelling the mechanism of oscillatory dynamics in biological networks with stochastic perturbations becomes paramountly significant. Although the classical energy landscape theory provides a tool to study this problem in multistable systems and explain cellular functions, it remains challenging to quantify the landscape for high-dimensional oscillatory systems accurately. Here we propose an approach called the diffusion decomposition of Gaussian approximation (DDGA). We demonstrate the efficacy of the DDGA in quantifying the energy landscape of oscillatory systems and corresponding stochastic dynamics, in comparison with existing approaches. By further applying the DDGA to high-dimensional biological networks, we are able to uncover more intricate biological mechanisms efficiently, which deepens our understanding of cellular functions.</description>
