      <title>Physical Layer Mutual Authentication in RIS-Aided Monostatic Backscatter Communications: A Dual-Edged Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter communication (BC) emerges as a pivotal technology for ultra-low-power energy harvesting applications, but its practical deployment is often hampered by notable security vulnerabilities. Physical layer authentication (PLA) offers a promising solution for securing BC by leveraging the unique characteristics of the communication medium. However, existing PLA approaches often fall short due to limited signal strength in practical BC scenarios and performance deterioration with increasing distance between the tag and the reader. Moreover, achieving mutual authentication has been largely neglected in current PLA schemes, given the passive nature of tags and their limited computational and energy resources. This paper introduces a reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-aided PLA scheme based on the physical features of received signals at legitimate endpoints through cascade links in monostatic BC (MBC) systems. By considering a RIS operating in its near-optimal conditions between a tag and a reader, the proposed PLA leverages the RIS-enhanced power delivery detected by the tag's energy detector and the optimized received signal strength (RSS) at the reader's signal processing unit, addressing the conventional challenges of mutual authentication, low PLA performance, and limited secure coverage area inherent in BC systems. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we show that as long as RIS is controlled by a trusted party in the network, it can boost the authentication performance across different system settings and strengthen the security features. Additionally, we analyze to explore the potential security threats when the RIS is compromised by an adversary, assessing its impact on the system's PLA performance and secrecy capacity, providing a comprehensive understanding of the security implications for RIS-aided MBC under such circumstances.</description>

      <title>Calibration of NYURay for Ray Tracing using 28, 73, and 142 GHz Channel Measurements conducted in Indoor, Outdoor, and Factory Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Site-specific wireless channel simulations via ray tracers can be used to effectively study wireless, decreasing the need for extensive site-specific radio propagation measurements. To ensure that ray tracer simulations faithfully reproduce wireless channels, calibration of simulation results against real-world measurements is required. In this study we introduce NYURay, a 3D ray tracer specifically tailored for mmWave and sub-THz frequencies. To reliably generate site-specific wireless channel parameters, NYURay is calibrated using radio propagation measurements conducted at 28, 73, and 142 GHz in diverse scenarios such as outdoor areas, indoor offices, and factories.
  Traditional ray tracing calibration assumes angle-dependent reflection, requiring slow iterative optimization techniques with no closed form solution. We propose a simpler and quicker novel calibration method that assumes angle-independent reflection. The effectiveness of the proposed calibration approach is demonstrated using NYURay. When comparing the directional multipath power predicted by NYURay to the actual measured power, the standard deviation in error was less than 3 dB in indoor office environments and less than 2 dB in outdoor and factory environments. The root mean square (RMS) delay spread and angular spread was underpredicted by NYURay due to incomplete environmental maps available for calibration, however an overall agreement between the measured and simulated values was observed. These results highlight the high level of accuracy NYURay provides in generating the site-specific real-world wireless channel, that could be used to generate synthetic data for machine learning.</description>

      <title>Error Correction Code Transformer: From Non-Unified to Unified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel coding is vital for reliable data transmission in modern wireless systems, and its significance will increase with the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks, which will need to support various error correction codes. However, traditional decoders were typically designed as fixed hardware circuits tailored to specific decoding algorithms, leading to inefficiencies and limited flexibility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, code-agnostic Transformer-based decoding architecture capable of handling multiple linear block codes, including Polar, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC), and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH), within a single framework. To achieve this, standardized units are employed to harmonize parameters across different code types, while the redesigned unified attention module compresses the structural information of various codewords. Additionally, a sparse mask, derived from the sparsity of the parity-check matrix, is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture inherent constraints between information and parity-check bits, resulting in improved decoding accuracy and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified Transformer-based decoder not only outperforms existing methods but also provides a flexible, efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Aided Secure Transmission for RIS-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have the issue of secrecy leakage when using the ISAC waveforms for sensing, thus posing a potential risk for eavesdropping. To address this problem, we propose to employ movable antennas (MAs) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to enhance the physical layer security (PLS) performance of ISAC systems, where an eavesdropping target potentially wiretaps the signals transmitted by the base station (BS). To evaluate the synergistic performance gain provided by MAs and RIS, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the sum-rate of the users by jointly optimizing the transmit/receive beamformers of the BS, the reflection coefficients of the RIS, and the positions of MAs at communication users, subject to a minimum communication rate requirement for each user, a minimum radar sensing requirement, and a maximum secrecy leakage to the eavesdropping target. To solve this non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, a two-layer penalty-based algorithm is developed by updating the penalty parameter in the outer-layer iterations to achieve a trade-off between the optimality and feasibility of the solution. In the inner-layer iterations, the auxiliary variables are first obtained with semi-closed-form solutions using Lagrange duality. Then, the receive beamformer filter at the BS is optimized by solving a Rayleigh-quotient subproblem. Subsequently, the transmit beamformer matrix is obtained by solving a convex subproblem. Finally, the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm is employed to optimize the RIS reflection coefficients and the positions of MAs. Extensive simulation results validate the considerable benefits of the proposed MAs-aided RIS-ISAC systems in enhancing security performance compared to traditional fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems.</description>

      <title>CSI Acquisition in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Surveillance Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) surveillance system, in which multiple multi-antenna monitoring nodes (MNs) are deployed in either observing or jamming mode to disrupt the communication between a multi-antenna untrusted pair. We propose a simple and effective channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme at the MNs. Specifically, our approach leverages pilot signals in both the uplink and downlink phases of the untrusted link, coupled with minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation. This enables the MNs to accurately estimate the effective channels to both the untrusted transmitter (UT) and untrusted receiver (UR), thereby yielding robust monitoring performance. We analyze the spectral efficiency (SE) performance of the untrusted links and of the monitoring system, taking into account the proposed CSI acquisition and successive MMSE cancellation schemes. The monitoring success probability (MSP) is then derived. Simulation results show that the CF-mMIMO surveillance system, relying on the proposed CSI acquisition scheme, can achieve monitoring performance close to that achieved by having perfect CSI knowledge of the untrusted link (theoretical upper bound), especially when the number of MNs is large.</description>

      <title>Unicast-Multicast Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Gradient-Based Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system with joint unicast and multi-group multicast transmissions. We derive exact closed-form expressions for the downlink achievable spectral efficiency (SE) of both unicast and multicast users. Based on these expressions, we formulate a joint optimization problem of access point (AP) selection and power control subject to quality of service (QoS) requirements of all unicast and multicast users and per-AP maximum transmit power constraint. The challenging formulated problem is transformed into a tractable form and a novel accelerated projected gradient (APG)-based algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results show that our joint optimization strategy enhances notably the sum SE (SSE) (up to 58%) compared to baseline schemes, while maintaining low complexity.</description>

      <title>A Practical Concatenated Coding Scheme for Noisy Shuffling Channels with Coset-based Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy shuffling channels capture the main characteristics of DNA storage systems where distinct segments of data are received out of order, after being corrupted by substitution errors. For realistic schemes with short-length segments, practical indexing and channel coding strategies are required to restore the order and combat the channel noise. In this paper, we develop a finite-length concatenated coding scheme that employs Reed-Solomon (RS) codes as outer codes and polar codes as inner codes, and utilizes an implicit indexing method based on cosets of the polar code. We propose a matched decoding method along with a metric for detecting the index that successfully restores the order, and correct channel errors at the receiver. Residual errors that are not corrected by the matched decoder are then corrected by the outer RS code. We derive analytical approximations for the frame error rate of the proposed scheme, and also evaluate its performance through simulations to demonstrate that the proposed implicit indexing method outperforms explicit indexing.</description>

      <title>On the Cost of Consecutive Estimation Error: Significance-Aware Non-linear Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the semantics-aware remote state estimation of an asymmetric Markov chain with prioritized states. Due to resource constraints, the sensor needs to trade between estimation quality and communication cost. The aim is to exploit the significance of information through the history of system realizations to determine the optimal timing of transmission, thereby reducing the amount of uninformative data transmitted in the network. To this end, we introduce a new metric, the significance-aware Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE), that captures two semantic attributes: the significance of estimation error and the cost of consecutive error. Different costs and non-linear age functions are assigned to different estimation errors to account for their relative importance to system performance. We identify the optimal transmission problem as a countably infinite state Markov decision process (MDP) with unbounded costs. We first give sufficient conditions on the age functions, source pattern, and channel reliability so that an optimal policy exists to have bounded average costs. We show that the optimal policy exhibits a switching structure. That is, the sensor triggers a transmission only when the system has been trapped in an error for a certain number of consecutive time slots. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the switching policy degenerates into a simple threshold policy, i.e., featuring identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Furthermore, we exploit the structural properties and develop a structured policy iteration (SPI) algorithm that considerably reduces computation overhead. Numerical results show that the optimal policy outperforms the classic rule-, distortion- and age-based policies. An important takeaway is that the more semantic attributes we utilize, the fewer transmissions are needed.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach for User-Centric Clustering in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrary to conventional massive MIMO cellular configurations plagued by inter-cell interference, cell-free massive MIMO systems distribute network resources across the coverage area, enabling users to connect with multiple access points (APs) and boosting both system capacity and fairness across user. In such systems, one critical functionality is the association between APs and users: determining the optimal association is indeed a combinatorial problem of prohibitive complexity. In this paper, a solution based on deep learning is thus proposed to solve the user clustering problem aimed at maximizing the sum spectral efficiency while controlling the number of active connections. The proposed solution can scale effectively with the number of users, leveraging long short-term memory cells to operate without the need for retraining. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, even in the presence of imperfect channel state information due to pilot contamination.</description>

      <title>Toward Adaptive Tracking and Communication via an Airborne Maneuverable Bi-Static ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an airborne maneuverable bi-static integrated sensing and communication system where both the transmitter and receiver are unmanned aerial vehicles. By timely forming a dynamic bi-static range based on the motion information of the target, such a system can provide an adaptive two dimensional tracking and communication services. Towards this end, a trajectory optimization problem for both transmits and receive UAV is formulated to achieve high-accurate motion state estimation by minimizing the time-variant Cramer Rao bound, subject to the sufficient communication signal-to-noise ratio to maintain communication channel prediction error. Then we develop an efficient approach based on the successive convex approximation technique and the S-procedure to address the problem. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed airborne maneuverable bi-static ISAC system is able to obtain higher tracking accuracy compared with the static or semi-dynamic ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of the Relative Entropy in the Regularization of Empirical Risk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of relative entropy asymmetry is analyzed in the context of empirical risk minimization (ERM) with relative entropy regularization (ERM-RER). Two regularizations are considered: $(a)$ the relative entropy of the measure to be optimized with respect to a reference measure (Type-I ERM-RER); or $(b)$ the relative entropy of the reference measure with respect to the measure to be optimized (Type-II ERM-RER). The main result is the characterization of the solution to the Type-II ERM-RER problem and its key properties. By comparing the well-understood Type-I ERM-RER with Type-II ERM-RER, the effects of entropy asymmetry are highlighted. The analysis shows that in both cases, regularization by relative entropy forces the solution's support to collapse into the support of the reference measure, introducing a strong inductive bias that can overshadow the evidence provided by the training data. Finally, it is shown that Type-II regularization is equivalent to Type-I regularization with an appropriate transformation of the empirical risk function.</description>

      <title>Universally Optimal Watermarking Schemes for LLMs: from Theory to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) boosts human efficiency but also poses misuse risks, with watermarking serving as a reliable method to differentiate AI-generated content from human-created text. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework for watermarking LLMs. Particularly, we jointly optimize both the watermarking scheme and detector to maximize detection performance, while controlling the worst-case Type-I error and distortion in the watermarked text. Within our framework, we characterize the universally minimum Type-II error, showing a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and distortion. More importantly, we identify the optimal type of detectors and watermarking schemes. Building upon our theoretical analysis, we introduce a practical, model-agnostic and computationally efficient token-level watermarking algorithm that invokes a surrogate model and the Gumbel-max trick. Empirical results on Llama-13B and Mistral-8$\times$7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we also explore how robustness can be integrated into our theoretical framework, which provides a foundation for designing future watermarking systems with improved resilience to adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Information-Driven Search and Track of Novel Space Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space surveillance depends on efficiently directing sensor resources to maintain custody of known catalog objects. However, it remains unclear how to best utilize these resources to rapidly search for and track newly detected space objects. Provided a novel measurement, a search set can be instantiated through admissible region constraints to inform follow-up observations. In lacking well-constrained bounds, this set rapidly spreads in the along-track direction, growing much larger than a follow-up sensor's finite field of view. Moreover, the number of novel objects may be uncertain, and follow-up observations are most commonly corrupted by false positives from known catalog objects and missed detections. In this work, we address these challenges through the introduction of a joint sensor control and multi-target tracking approach. The search set associated to a novel measurement is represented by a Cardinalized Probability Hypothesis Density (CPHD), which jointly tracks the state uncertainty associated to a set of objects and a probability mass function for the true target number. In follow-up sensor scans, the information contained in an empty measurement set, and returns from both novel objects and known catalog objects is succinctly captured through this paradigm. To maximize the utility of a follow-up sensor, we introduce an information-driven sensor control approach for steering the instrument. Our methods are tested on two relevant test cases and we provide a comparative analysis with current naive tasking strategies.</description>

      <title>Receptors cluster in high-curvature membrane regions for optimal spatial gradient sensing</title>

Abstract: Spatial information from cell-surface receptors is crucial for processes that require signal processing and sensing of the environment. Here, we investigate the optimal placement of such receptors through a theoretical model that minimizes uncertainty in gradient estimation. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the physical limits of sensing or biochemical processes, we reproduce the emergence of clusters that closely resemble those observed in real cells. On perfect spherical surfaces, optimally placed receptors spread uniformly. When perturbations break their symmetry, receptors cluster in regions of high curvature, massively reducing estimation uncertainty. This agrees with mechanistic models that minimize elastic preference discrepancies between receptors and cell membranes. We further extend our model to motile receptors responding to cell-shape changes and external fluid flow, demonstrating the relevance of our model in realistic scenarios. Our findings provide a simple and utilitarian explanation for receptor clustering at high-curvature regions when high sensing accuracy is paramount.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication for Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication is a promising technology to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only the semantic information of the source data. However, traditional semantic communication methods primarily focus on data reconstruction tasks, which may not be efficient for emerging generative tasks such as text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. To address this limitation, this paper develops a novel generative semantic communication framework for TTS synthesis, leveraging generative artificial intelligence technologies. Firstly, we utilize a pre-trained large speech model called WavLM and the residual vector quantization method to construct two semantic knowledge bases (KBs) at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. The KB at the transmitter enables effective semantic extraction, while the KB at the receiver facilitates lifelike speech synthesis. Then, we employ a transformer encoder and a diffusion model to achieve efficient semantic coding without introducing significant communication overhead. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves much higher fidelity for the generated speech than four baselines, in both cases with additive white Gaussian noise channel and Rayleigh fading channel.</description>

      <title>Class of codes correcting absorptions and emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a general family of quantum codes that protect against all emission, absorption, dephasing, and raising/lowering errors up to an arbitrary fixed order. Such codes are known in the literature as absorption-emission (AE) codes. We derive simplified error correction conditions for a general AE code and show that any permutation-invariant code that corrects $\le t$ errors can be mapped to an AE code that corrects up to order-$t$ transitions. Carefully tuning the parameters of permutationally invariant codes, we construct several examples of efficient AE codes, hosted in systems with low total angular momentum. Our results also imply that spin codes can be mapped to AE codes, enabling us to characterize logical operators for certain subclasses of such codes.</description>

      <title>Factoring Perfect Reconstruction Filter Banks into Causal Lifting Matrices: A Diophantine Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.09040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elementary theory of bivariate linear Diophantine equations over polynomial rings is used to construct causal lifting factorizations (elementary matrix decompositions) for causal two-channel FIR perfect reconstruction transfer matrices and wavelet transforms. The Diophantine approach generates causal factorizations satisfying certain polynomial degree-reducing inequalities, enabling a new factorization strategy called the Causal Complementation Algorithm. This provides a causal (i.e., polynomial, hence realizable) alternative to the noncausal lifting scheme developed by Daubechies and Sweldens using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for Laurent polynomials. The new approach replaces the Euclidean Algorithm with Gaussian elimination employing a slight generalization of polynomial division that ensures existence and uniqueness of quotients whose remainders satisfy user-specified divisibility constraints. The Causal Complementation Algorithm is shown to be more general than the causal version of the Euclidean Algorithm approach by generating additional causal lifting factorizations beyond those obtainable using the polynomial Euclidean Algorithm.</description>

      <title>MMSE Channel Estimation in Large-Scale MIMO: Improved Robustness with Reduced Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale MIMO systems with a massive number N of individually controlled antennas pose significant challenges for minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation, based on uplink pilots. The major ones arise from the computational complexity, which scales with $N^3$, and from the need for accurate knowledge of the channel statistics. This paper aims to address both challenges by introducing reduced-complexity channel estimation methods that achieve the performance of MMSE in terms of estimation accuracy and uplink spectral efficiency while demonstrating improved robustness in practical scenarios where channel statistics must be estimated. This is achieved by exploiting the inherent structure of the spatial correlation matrix induced by the array geometry. Specifically, we use a Kronecker decomposition for uniform planar arrays and a well-suited circulant approximation for uniform linear arrays. By doing so, a significantly lower computational complexity is achieved, scaling as $N\sqrt{N}$ and $N\log N$ for squared planar arrays and linear arrays, respectively.</description>

      <title>Optimal Tree-Based Mechanisms for Differentially Private Approximate CDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18573v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the $\varepsilon$-differentially private (DP) release of an approximate cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the samples in a dataset. We assume that the true (approximate) CDF is obtained after lumping the data samples into a fixed number $K$ of bins. In this work, we extend the well-known binary tree mechanism to the class of \emph{level-uniform tree-based} mechanisms and identify $\varepsilon$-DP mechanisms that have a small $\ell_2$-error. We identify optimal or close-to-optimal tree structures when either of the parameters, which are the branching factors or the privacy budgets at each tree level, are given, and when the algorithm designer is free to choose both sets of parameters. Interestingly, when we allow the branching factors to take on real values, under certain mild restrictions, the optimal level-uniform tree-based mechanism is obtained by choosing equal branching factors \emph{independent} of $K$, and equal privacy budgets at all levels. Furthermore, for selected $K$ values, we explicitly identify the optimal \emph{integer} branching factors and tree height, assuming equal privacy budgets at all levels. Finally, we describe general strategies for improving the private CDF estimates further, by combining multiple noisy estimates and by post-processing the estimates for consistency.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-Aware Debiasing: A Modern Inference Framework with Applications to Principal Components Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07810v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Debiasing is a fundamental concept in high-dimensional statistics. While degrees-of-freedom adjustment is the state-of-the-art technique in high-dimensional linear regression, it is limited to i.i.d. samples and sub-Gaussian covariates. These constraints hinder its broader practical use. Here, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Debiasing--a novel method for high-dimensional regression. Our approach applies to problems with structured dependencies, heavy tails, and low-rank structures. Our method achieves debiasing through a rescaled gradient descent step, deriving the rescaling factor using spectral information of the sample covariance matrix. The spectrum-based approach enables accurate debiasing in much broader contexts. We study the common modern regime where the number of features and samples scale proportionally. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator (suitably centered and scaled) under various convergence notions when the covariates are right-rotationally invariant. Such designs have garnered recent attention due to their crucial role in compressed sensing. Furthermore, we devise a consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance.
  Our work has two notable by-products: first, we use Spectrum-Aware Debiasing to correct bias in principal components regression (PCR), providing the first debiased PCR estimator in high dimensions. Second, we introduce a principled test for checking alignment between the signal and the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. This test is independently valuable for statistical methods developed using approximate message passing, leave-one-out, or convex Gaussian min-max theorems. We demonstrate our method through simulated and real data experiments. Technically, we connect approximate message passing algorithms with debiasing and provide the first proof of the Cauchy property of vector approximate message passing (V-AMP).</description>
