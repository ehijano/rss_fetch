      <title>Ground-roll Separation From Land Seismic Records Based on Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-roll wave is a common coherent noise in land field seismic data. This Rayleigh-type surface wave usually has low frequency, low apparent velocity, and high amplitude, therefore obscures the reflection events of seismic shot gathers. Commonly used techniques focus on the differences of ground-roll and reflection in transformed domain such as $f-k$ domain, wavelet domain, or curvelet domain. These approaches use a series of fixed atoms or bases to transform the data in time-space domain into transformed domain to separate different waveforms, thus tend to suffer from the complexity for a delicate design of the parameters of the transform domain filter. To deal with these problems, a novel way is proposed to separate ground-roll from reflections using convolutional neural network (CNN) model based method to learn to extract the features of ground-roll and reflections automatically based on training data. In the proposed method, low-pass filtered seismic data which is contaminated by ground-roll wave is used as input of CNN, and then outputs both ground-roll component and low-frequency part of reflection component simultaneously. Discriminative loss is applied together with similarity loss in the training process to enhance the similarity to their train labels as well as the difference between the two outputs. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real data, showing that CNN based method can separate ground roll from reflections effectively, and has generalization ability to a certain extent.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of keeping Mars warm with nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-third of Mars' surface has shallow-buried H$_2$O, but it is currently too cold for use by life. Proposals to warm Mars using greenhouse gases require a large mass of ingredients that are rare on Mars' surface. However, we show here that artificial aerosols made from materials that are readily available at Mars-for example, conductive nanorods that are ~9 $\mu$m long-could warm Mars &gt;5 $\times$ 10$^3$ times more effectively than the best gases. Such nanoparticles forward-scatter sunlight and efficiently block upwelling thermal infrared. Similar to the natural dust of Mars, they are swept high into Mars' atmosphere, allowing delivery from the near-surface. For a particle lifetime of 10 years, two climate models indicate that sustained release at 30 liters/sec would globally warm Mars by $\gtrsim$30 K and start to melt the ice. Therefore, if nanoparticles can be made at scale on (or delivered to) Mars, then the barrier to warming of Mars appears to not be as high as previously thought.</description>

      <title>Seismic Data Interpolation via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models with Coherence-corrected Resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate interpolation of seismic data is crucial for improving the quality of imaging and interpretation. In recent years, deep learning models such as U-Net and generative adversarial networks have been widely applied to seismic data interpolation. However, they often underperform when the training and test missing patterns do not match. To alleviate this issue, here we propose a novel framework that is built upon the multi-modal adaptable diffusion models. In the training phase, following the common wisdom, we use the denoising diffusion probabilistic model with a cosine noise schedule. This cosine global noise configuration improves the use of seismic data by reducing the involvement of excessive noise stages. In the inference phase, we introduce the denoising diffusion implicit model to reduce the number of sampling steps. Different from the conventional unconditional generation, we incorporate the known trace information into each reverse sampling step for achieving conditional interpolation. To enhance the coherence and continuity between the revealed traces and the missing traces, we further propose two strategies, including successive coherence correction and resampling. Coherence correction penalizes the mismatches in the revealed traces, while resampling conducts cyclic interpolation between adjacent reverse steps. Extensive experiments on synthetic and field seismic data validate our model's superiority and demonstrate its generalization capability to various missing patterns and different noise levels with just one training session. In addition, uncertainty quantification and ablation studies are also investigated.</description>
