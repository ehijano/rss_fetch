      <title>Anderson localization for 1-d quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators with degenerate weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Anderson localization for 1-d discrete Schr\"odinger operators with positive weights. The distinctive feature of this work lies in the degeneracy of the weights, with both the potentials and weights assumed to be analytic and quasi-periodic. Operators of this kind originate from distinct mathematical physics problems, which include the Frenkel-Kontorova model with impurities, the discretization of singular Sturm-Liouville operators, and the Fisher-KPP lattice equation in heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Multispecies inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP with general capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an $n$-species $t$-PushTASEP, an integrable long-range stochastic process, on a one-dimensional periodic lattice with inhomogeneities $x_1,\ldots,x_L$ and arbitrary capacity $l$ at each lattice site. The Markov matrix is identified with an alternating sum of commuting transfer matrices over all fundamental representations of $U_t(\widehat{sl}_{n+1})$. Stationary probabilities are expressed in a matrix product form involving a fusion of quantized corner transfer matrices for the strange five-vertex model introduced by Okado, Scrimshaw, and the second author. The resulting partition function, which serves as the normalization factor of the stationary probabilities, is obtained from the $l=1$ case by a finite plethystic substitution of length $l$.</description>

      <title>Prefactorization algebras for the conformal Laplacian: Central charge and Hilbert Fock space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d\geq 2$ and let $\mathrm{Mfld}_{d,\mathrm{emb}}^{\mathrm{CO}}$ be the symmetric monoidal category of oriented Riemannian $d$-manifolds and conformal open embeddings. The prefactorization algebra of the conformal Laplacian defines a symmetric monoidal functor $F_{\mathrm{CL}}:\mathrm{Mfld}_{d,\mathrm{emb}}^{\mathrm{CO}}\rightarrow \mathrm{Vect}_\mathbb{R}$.
  For Euclidean domains $U\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $F_{\mathrm{CL}}(U)$ is identified with $\mathrm{Sym} H'(U)$ via the Green function, where $H'(U)$ is the continuous dual of harmonic functions on $U$. For $d\geq 3$ this identification is natural under all conformal transformations, while in $d=2$ the failure of naturality is governed by an explicit harmonic cocycle (the central charge). For the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, $F_{\mathrm{CL}}(\mathbb D)$ carries an algebra structure over the operad of conformal disk embeddings and admits a canonical dense embedding into the Hilbert Fock space; in $d=2$ the latter holds after restricting to a codimension-one subspace, as suggested by logarithmic CFT.</description>

      <title>The State-Operator Clifford Compatibility: A Real Algebraic Framework for Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Pauli-Clifford connection to introduce a real, grade-preserving algebraic framework for $N$-qubit quantum computation based on the tensor product structure $C\ell_{2,0}(\mathbb{R})^{\otimes N}$. In this setting the bivector $J = e_{12}$ satisfies $J^{2} = -1$ and supplies the complex structure on a minimal left ideal via right-multiplication, while Pauli operations arise as left actions of suitable Clifford elements. Adopting a canonical stabilizer mapping, the $N$-qubit computational basis state $|0\cdots 0\rangle$ is represented natively by a tensor product of real algebraic idempotents. This structural choice leads to a State-Operator Clifford Compatibility law that is stable under the geometric product for $N$ qubits and aligns symbolic Clifford multiplication with unitary evolution on the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of the Parametric Amplifier with Dunkl Derivative: Spectral and Statistical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the parametric amplifier Hamiltonian within the framework of the Dunkl formalism. We introduce the Dunkl creation and annihilation operators and show that their quadratic combinations generate an $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. The spectral problem is solved exactly using two algebraic methods: the $su(1,1)$ tilting transformation and the generalized Bogoliubov transformation. The exact energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of the Dunkl number coherent states. Furthermore, we compute the Mandel $Q$ parameter and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ to analyze the statistical properties of the Dunkl squeezed states. We show that, for the squeezed vacuum, the Mandel parameter remains independent of the Dunkl deformation, whereas the correlation function exhibits an explicit dependence on the Dunkl parameter $\mu$, which modifies the photon bunching effects. Finally, we show that our results reduce to the standard parametric amplifier case in the limit of vanishing Dunkl deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>From Multipartite Entanglement to TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At long distances, a gapped phase of matter is described by a topological quantum field theory (TQFT). We conjecture a tight and concrete relationship between the genuine $(d+1)$-partite entanglement -- labelled by a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ -- in the ground state of a $(d-1)+1$-dimensional gapped theory and the partition function of the low energy TQFT on $M$. In particular, the conjecture implies that for $d=3$, the ground state wavefunction can determine the modular tensor category description of the low energy TQFT. We verify our conjecture for general (2+1)-dimensional Levin-Wen string-net models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal theories are used to model a broad array of non-equilibrium phenomena found in nature ranging from biological systems like networks of neurons to the behavior of overflowing water fountains. This includes systems broadly classified as active matter systems. We show that the stochastic theories which describe nonreciprocal interactions can be mapped into quantum field theories described by a supersymmetric action with a single supercharge. The theories are generically non-Hermitian. This generalizes the past work of Parisi and Sourlas on reciprocal theories, which model systems with interactions derived from potentials.</description>

      <title>Spectral boundaries of deterministic matrices deformed by rotationally invariant random non-Hermitian ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the great miracles of random matrix theory is that, in the $N \to \infty$ limit, many otherwise intractable matrix problems with horrendously complicated finite-$N$ expressions admit remarkably simple and elegant asymptotic solutions. In this paper, we illustrate this phenomenon in the context of spectral boundaries (or spectral edges) for deformed random matrices. Specifically, we consider matrices of the form $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a deterministic $N\times N$ matrix (not necessarily Hermitian) and $\mathbf{B}$ is a rotationally invariant random matrix. In the large-$N$ limit, we show that the complex eigenvalue distribution of $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$ satisfies remarkably simple boundary equations that depend on the $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$ transforms of $\mathbf{B}$. We illustrate our results on several explicit random matrix ensembles and support them with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the multimetric theory of gravitation, also known as multigravity. We derive additional new exact solutions for the theory in proportional Kerr-Schild and double Kerr-Schild forms. We extend several solutions from the theory of General Relativity, characterized by a constant Ricci scalar in single and double Kerr-Schild forms, to derive solutions in the multi-gravity context. We also examine and extend the classical double copy relations that can be constructed out from these solutions in multigravity exploring the dynamics of the single copy and zero copy fields.</description>

      <title>The empirical laws for Majorana fields in a curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a sequel to our previous paper (arXiv:2511.12311), where we considered the conceptual problem on the empirical laws for the Klein\textendash Gordon quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS), and we will consider the similar problems for the Majorana field on curved spacetime here. A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws.</description>

      <title>Overdamped limits for Langevin dynamics with position-dependent coefficients via $L^2$-hypocoercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note provides a simple derivation of the overdamped approximation for kinetic (or underdamped) equilibrium Langevin dynamics, in cases where certain coefficients depend on the position variable. The equivalent small-mass limit of these dynamics, known as the Kramers--Smoluchowski approximation, in the case of a state-dependent friction coefficient, has been previously studied by a variety of approaches. Our new approach uses hypocoercivity estimates, which may be of interest in their own right, and lead to a very direct derivation, providing in particular a clear explanation of the ``noise-induced drift'' term in the overdamped equation in the case of a state-dependent friction term. Using the same approach, we also treat several effective kinetic dynamical models derived from a coarse-graining approximation of a high-dimensional system, as well as a class of kinetic dynamics with position-dependent mass matrices. All of these models are relevant to applications in computational chemistry. We finally identify a mistake in a related work and suggest a solution.</description>

      <title>The Kinematics and Dynamics Theories of a Total Lagrangian Finite Element Analysis Framework for Finite Deformation Multibody Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a Total Lagrangian finite element formulation for deformable body dynamics. We employ the TL-FEA framework to simulate the time evolution of collections of bodies whose motion is constrained by kinematic constraints and which mutually interact through contact and friction. These bodies experience large displacements, large deformations, and large rotations. A systematic approach is proposed for classifying and posing kinematic constraints acting between the bodies present in the system. We derive the governing equations for ANCF beam, ANCF shell, and tetrahedral elements, and present hyperelastic material models including St. Venant-Kirchhoff and Mooney-Rivlin formulations with their corresponding internal force contributions and consistent tangent stiffness matrices. A finite-strain Kelvin-Voigt viscous damping model is incorporated in the TL-FEA formulation for numerical stability.</description>

      <title>Smoothing on $L^1$ for ground state transformed semigroups in non-local settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $L^1$-smoothing properties for a broad class of semigroups arising from the ground state transformation of Schr\"odinger semigroups with confining potentials associated with non-local L\'evy operators, for which (asymptotic) ultracontractivity and hypercontractivity fail. Our work is inspired by Talagrand's convolution conjecture in the discrete cube setting, as well as by subsequent developments on the classical Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. The estimates we provide exhibit a clear dependence on the potential and the L\'evy measure defining the kinetic term operator, and they yield a description of the semigroups' action on $L^1$ in terms of Orlicz spaces. Our framework is quite general, encompassing fractional and relativistic Laplacians as kinetic operators. The results are illustrated by numerous examples demonstrating that the $L^1$-regularizing effects become stronger as $t \uparrow \infty$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the wave front sets of solutions to fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations \(i\partial_{t}u =(-\Delta)^{\theta/2}u + V(x)u\)
  with $0&lt;\theta &lt;2$ via the wave packet transform (short-time Fourier transform). We clarify the relationship between the order \(\theta\) of the fractional Laplacian and the growth rate of the potential in the problem of propagation of singularities. In particular, we present a theorem that bridges the propagation mechanisms of singularities for the Schr\"odinger and wave equations.</description>

      <title>Tight any-shot quantum decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information decoupling is a fundamental primitive in quantum information theory, underlying various applications in quantum physics. We prove a novel one-shot decoupling theorem formulated in terms of quantum relative entropy distance, with the decoupling error bounded by two sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropies. In the asymptotic i.i.d. setting of standard information decoupling via partial trace, we show that this bound is ensemble-tight in quantum relative entropy distance and thereby yields a characterization of the associated decoupling error exponent in the low-cost-rate regime.
  Leveraging this framework, we derive several operational applications formulated in terms of purified distance: (i) a single-letter expression for the exact error exponent of quantum state merging in terms of Petz-R\'enyi conditional entropies, and (ii) regularized expressions for the achievable error exponent of entanglement distillation and quantum channel coding in terms of Petz-R\'enyi coherent informations. We further prove that these achievable bounds are tight for maximally correlated states and generalized dephasing channels, respectively, for the high distillation-rate/coding-rate regimes.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in quasi-Hermitian quantum models at exceptional points of order four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transition is interpreted as an evolution, at the end of which a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian $H(g)$ loses its observability. In the language of mathematics, such a quantum catastrophe occurs at an exceptional point of order $N$ (EPN). Although the Hamiltonian $H(g)$ itself becomes unphysical in the limit of $g \to g^{EPN}$, it is shown that it can play the role of an unperturbed operator in a perturbation-approximation analysis of the vicinity of the EPN singularity. Such an analysis is elementary at $N\leq 3$ and numerical at $N\geq 5$, so we pick up $N=4$. We demonstrate that the specific EP4 degeneracy becomes accessible via a unitary evolution process realizable inside a parametric domain ${\cal D}_{\rm physical}$, the boundaries of which are determined non-numerically. Possible relevance of such a mathematical result in the context of non-Hermitian photonics is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Scattering in Instanton Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we evaluate one-loop all-plus gluon amplitudes of $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f$ fundamental fermions in the presence of a flavour instanton background. Fermion zero modes are regulated with a chiral mass term. This computation is performed by cancelling a twistorial 't Hooft anomaly via the Green-Schwarz mechanism. We find that the trace-ordered amplitude has the form of a Parke-Taylor factor multiplied by the Fourier transform of the instanton density evaluated on the total momentum of the gluons. A background flavour instanton modifies the leading soft gluon and photon theorem, generating a level equal to twice the instanton charge in the soft Kac-Moody symmetry. We discuss the implications of our results for amplitudes in the presence of dynamical instantons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radially symmetric non-BPS 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles and dyons are constructed as resurgent transseries: infinite sums of exponentially decaying terms, each multiplied by a factorially divergent fluctuation factor. All higher exponential terms are explicitly expressed in terms of the leading order solutions. In the BPS limit all fluctuation terms truncate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of light interacting with a near-resonant atomic medium using the truncated Wigner and positive P phase-space representations. The atomic degrees of freedom are described using the Jordan-Schwinger mapping. The dynamics is first analyzed under unitary evolution and subsequently in the presence of an optical reservoir. While both approaches capture the main features of the light-matter dynamics, we find that the truncated Wigner approximation exhibits noticeable deviations for stronger interaction strengths and when reservoir-induced noise becomes significant.</description>

Abstract: We consider one-dimensional deterministic and random tight-binding Hamiltonians modeling electronic properties of twisted bilayer materials. When the twisted structure is incommensurate, we prove convergence of the density of states measure in the thermodynamic limit and Pastur's theorem on shift-invariance of the spectrum. Our results extend those of Massatt et al. and Canc\`es et al. in allowing for randomness. We provide numerical density of states computations for the operators we consider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a variational approach to the Bose-Hubbard model based on Bogoliubov theory. We introduce the grand canonical and canonical free energy functionals for which we prove the existence of minimizers. By analyzing their structure we show the existence of a thermally driven phase transition by showing that the system is superfluid at sufficiently low temperatures and insulating at high temperatures. In particular, we show that this model does not exhibit a quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Linear Differential Equations for Unitary Matrix Integrals: Applications and Generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider characterisations of the class of unitary matrix integrals $\big\langle (\det U)^q {\rm e}^{s^{1/2} \operatorname{Tr}(U + U^\dagger)} \big\rangle_{U(l)}$ in terms of a first-order matrix linear differential equation for a vector function of size $l+1$, and in terms of a scalar linear differential equation of degree ${l+1}$. It will be shown that the latter follows from the former. The matrix linear differential equation provides an efficient way to compute the power series expansion of the matrix integrals, which with $q=0$ and $q=l$ are of relevance to the enumeration of longest increasing subsequences for random permutations, and to the question of the moments of the first and second derivative of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line, respectively. This procedure is compared against that following from known characterisations involving the $\sigma$-Painlev&amp;\'e III$'$ second-order nonlinear differential equation. We show too that the natural $\beta$ generalisation of the unitary group integral permits characterisation by the same classes of linear differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove convergence of solutions of Dirichlet problems and Green's functions on Tutte's harmonic embeddings to those of the linearized Monge-Amp\`ere equation $\mathcal{L}_\varphi h=0$. The potential $\varphi$ appears as the limit of piecewise linear potentials associated with the embeddings and the only assumption that we use is the uniform convexity of $\varphi$. Even if $\varphi$ is quadratic, this setup significantly generalizes known results for discrete harmonic functions on orthodiagonal tilings. Motivated by potential applications to the analysis of 2d lattice models on irregular graphs, we also study the situation in which the limits are harmonic in a different complex structure.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy of the dilute Bose-Hubbard gas on Bravais lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study interacting bosons on a three-dimensional Bravais lattice with positive hopping amplitudes and on-site repulsive interactions. We prove that, in the dilute limit $\rho\to 0$, the ground state energy density satisfies $$e_0(\rho) = 4\pi a \rho^2 \big(1+O(\rho^{1/6})\big),$$ where $a$ is the lattice scattering length defined through the corresponding two-body problem. This establishes the analogue of the Dyson and Lieb-Yngvason theorems for the Bose-Hubbard gas. Our result shows that the leading-order energy is universal: although the lattice geometry affects the microscopic dispersion relation, it enters the leading order asymptotics only through the scattering length. In particular, it is independent of other features of the underlying Bravais lattice.</description>

      <title>On the Limit of the Tridiagonal Model for $\beta$-Dyson Brownian Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work, a description of the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E random matrix is provided by Edelman and Dumitriu. The resulting tridiagonal ensemble makes sense for all $\beta&gt;0$, and has spectrum given by the $\beta$-ensemble for all $\beta&gt;0$. Moreover, the tridiagonal model has useful stochastic operator limits which was introduced and analyzed in subsequent studies.
  In this work, we analogously study the result of applying the Householder tridiagonalization algorithm to a G$\beta$E process which has eigenvalues governed by $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion. We propose an explicit limit of the upper left $k \times k$ minor of the $n \times n$ tridiagonal process as $n \to \infty$ and $k$ remains fixed. We prove the result for $\beta=1$, and also provide numerical evidence for $\beta=1,2,4$. This leads us to conjecture the form of a dynamical $\beta$-stochastic Airy operator with smallest $k$ eigenvalues evolving according to the $n \to \infty$ limit of the largest, centered and re-scaled, $k$ eigenvalues of $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. II: The General Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) $F = 0$ admitting a local (point, contact, or higher) symmetry $X$ with the characteristic $\varphi$, invariant solutions satisfy the reduced system $F = \varphi = 0$. We propose a framework that allows, for every $X$-invariant conservation law, presymplectic structure, variational principle, or another geometric structure of the given PDE system $F = 0$, to systematically calculate its corresponding reduced form that describes the corresponding structure for the reduced system $F = \varphi = 0$. In particular, we show in what way Noether's theorem holding for the given PDE system is inherited by the reduced PDE system. We consider several detailed examples, including cases of point and higher symmetry invariance. The proposed framework is directly applicable to a wide range of PDE models, including complex PDE systems of contemporary interest arising across disciplines, where symmetry reduction is essential for analysis and simulation, as well as to integrable, Lagrangian, and gauge systems.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23995v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem:
  Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ25a]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$
  We also discuss the relationship between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend/construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a class of divergences measuring the difference between probability density functions on the one-dimensional sample space. This divergence is a one-parameter variation of the Itakura--Saito divergence between quantile density functions. We prove that the proposed divergence is a one-parameter variation of the transport Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hessian distance of negative Boltzmann entropy with respect to the Wasserstein-$2$ metric. From Taylor expansions, we also formulate the $3$-symmetric tensor in Wasserstein-$2$ space, which is given by an iterative Gamma three operator. The alpha--geodesic on Wasserstein space is also derived. From these properties, we name the proposed divergences transport alpha divergences. We provide several examples of transport alpha divergences on one dimensional distributions, such as generative models and Cauchy distributions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Moduli of stable supermaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of stable supermap from SUSY curves to a fixed target superscheme, and prove that when the target is (super)projective, stable supermaps are parameterized by a Deligne-Mumford superstack with superschematic and separated diagonal. We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps from spin curves to the bosonic reduction of the target, whose fibers are linear schemes; for this reason, the moduli superstack of stable supermaps is not proper unless such linear schemes reduce to a point. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the moduli superstack, which agrees with the characterization of the bosonic reduction just mentioned and with the dimension formula for the case of bosonic target existing in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Formalism Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16480v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle confined to a straight line, I compile, initially in a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics and contrast them with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, resulting from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. The latter was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</description>

      <title>Multiple commutation relations of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$, nested Bethe vector and the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a certain type of multiple commutation relations of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$. We show that all the coefficients in the multiple commutation relations between the $L$-operator elements are given in terms of the trigonometric weight functions for the vector representation, independent of the representation of the $L$-operator. For rank one case, our proof also gives a conceptual understanding why the coefficients can also be expressed using the Izergin-Korepin determinants. As a related result, by specializing expressions for the universal nested Bethe vector by Pakuliak-Ragoucy-Slavnov, we also find a construction of the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for the vector representation using different $L$-operator elements from the constructions by Nazarov-Tarasov or Molev. We also present corresponding results for the Yangian $Y_h(\mathfrak{gl}_N)$.</description>

      <title>The geometric control of boundary-catalytic branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundary-catalytic branching processes describe a broad class of natural phenomena where the population of diffusing particles grows due to their spontaneous binary branching (e.g., division, fission or splitting) on a catalytic boundary located in a complex environment. We investigate the possibility of the geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to catalytic branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on absorbing regions of the boundary. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction in a bounded domain. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics, chemistry, and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Haagerup Symmetry in $(E_8)_1$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.</description>

      <title>Refined half-integer condition on RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.</description>
