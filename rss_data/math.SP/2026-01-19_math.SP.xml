      <title>Magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian on a perturbed twisted tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian for a compact perturbation of a three-dimensional, periodically twisted tube is unstable with respect to domain deformations. This means that if the periodically twisted tube is unperturbed, then the spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian is purely essential. On the other hand, the perturbation of this domain produces eigenvalues below the essential spectrum. This paper considers the Dirichlet-Laplace operator with a magnetic field. We explicitly prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Laplacian is stable under small and local deformations of the domain.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Theory on Twisted Hilbert Scales: A Frame-Theoretic Approach to Half-Integer Fourier Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Hilbert scale on $L^2([0,1])$ via a unitary twist operator that maps the standard Fourier basis to half-integer frequency exponentials. The resulting weighted spaces, equipped with norms indexed by $(1+|k+\tfrac{1}{2}|^2)^s$, admit a canonical diagonal operator with the compact resolvent and spectrum $\{k+\tfrac{1}{2}\}_{k\in\mathbb{Z}}$. We prove that this operator defines a Fredholm mapping between adjacent scale levels with index zero, provide an explicit solution to an antiperiodic boundary value problem illustrating the framework, and compute the zeta-regularized determinant $\det_\zeta(|\widetilde{A}|) = 2$ using the Hurwitz zeta function. We establish stability under bounded perturbations and verify the well-definedness of spectral flow. The framework is developed entirely through functional-analytic methods without differential operators or boundary value problems. The construction is motivated by twisted spinor boundary conditions on non-orientable manifolds, though the present work is formulated abstractly in operator-theoretic language.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds with relative norm: Perturbation of eigenspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are used abundantly in many areas of mathematics and data science. Many bounds (such as the above two) involve the spectral norm of the noise matrix and are sharp in worst case analysis.
  In order to refine these classical bounds, we introduce a new parameter, which we refer to as the relative norm. This parameter measures the strength of the action of the noise matrix on the relevant eigenvectors of the ground matrix. It has turned out that in a number of situations, we can use the relative norm as a replacement for the spectral norm. This has led to a number of notable improvements under certain sets of assumptions, which are frequently met in practice. For instance, our new results apply very well in the case when the noise matrix is random.
  For the purpose of our study, we introduce a new method of analysis, which combines the classical contour integral argument with new (combinatorial) ideas. This method is robust and of independent interest.
  In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces (Davis-Kahan type results). Perturbation bounds for eigenspaces are essential in statistics and theoretical computer science, and thus deserve a special treatment. Furthermore, this will lay the ground for the more technical treatment of general matrix functionals, which appears in a future paper.</description>

      <title>A radial scalar product for Kerr quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17678v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A scalar product for quasinormal mode solutions to Teukolsky's homogeneous radial equation is presented. Evaluation of this scalar product can be performed either by direct integration, or by evaluation of a confluent hypergeometric functions. The related scalar product will be useful for better understanding analytic solutions to Teukolsky's radial equation, particularly the quasi-normal modes, their potential spatial completeness, and whether the quasi-normal mode overtone excitations may be estimated by spectral decomposition, rather than fitting. With that motivation, the scalar product is applied to confluent Heun polynomials where it is used to derive their peculiar orthogonality and eigenvalue properties. A potentially new relationship is derived between the confluent Heun polynomials' scalar products and eigenvalues. Using these results, it is shown for the first time that Teukolsky's radial equation (and perhaps similar confluent Heun equations) are, in principle, exactly tri-diagonalizable. To this end, "canonical" confluent Heun polynomials are conjectured.</description>

      <title>Natural polynomials for Kerr quasi-normal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a polynomial basis that exactly tridiagonalizes Teukolsky's radial equation for quasi-normal modes. These polynomials naturally emerge from the radial problem, and they are canonical in that they possess key features of classical polynomials. Our canonical polynomials may be constructed using various methods, the simplest of which is the Gram-Schmidt process. In contrast with other polynomial bases, our polynomials allow for Teukolsky's radial equation to be represented as a simple matrix eigenvalue equation. We expect that our polynomials will be useful for better understanding the Kerr quasinormal modes' properties, particularly their prospective spatial completeness and orthogonality. We show that our polynomials are closely related to the confluent Heun and Pollaczek-Jacobi type polynomials. Consequently, our construction of polynomials may be used to tridiagonalize other instances of the confluent Heun equation. We apply our polynomials to a series of simple examples, including: (1) the high accuracy numerical computation of radial eigenvalues, (2) the evaluation and validation of quasinormal mode solutions to Teukolsky's radial equation, and (3) the use of Schwarzschild radial functions to represent those of Kerr. Along the way, a potentially new concept, polynomial/non-polynomial duality, is encountered and applied to show that some quasinormal mode separation constants are well approximated by confluent Heun polynomial eigenvalues. We briefly discuss the implications of our results on various topics, including the prospective spatial completeness of Kerr quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with kinks and the asymptotic behavior of the graph Laplacian operator with Gaussian kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce manifolds with kinks, a class of manifolds with possibly singular boundary that notably contains manifolds with smooth boundary and corners. We derive the asymptotic behavior of the Graph Laplace operator with Gaussian kernel and its deterministic limit on these spaces as bandwidth goes to zero. We show that this asymptotic behavior is determined by the inward sector of the tangent space and, as special cases, we derive its behavior near interior and singular points. Lastly, we show the validity of our theoretical results using numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Existence, degeneracy and stability of ground states by logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on Clifford algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove existence and finite degeneracy of ground states of energy forms satisfying logarithmic Sobolev inequalities with respect to non vacuum states of Clifford algebras. We then derive the stability of the ground state with respect to certain unbounded perturbations of the energy form. Finally, we show how this provides an infinitesimal approach to existence and uniqueness of the ground state of Hamiltonians considered by L. Gross in QFT, describing spin $1/2$ Dirac particles subject to interactions with an external scalar field.</description>
