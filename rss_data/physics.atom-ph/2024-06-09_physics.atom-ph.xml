      <title>Quantum hardware demonstrations of relativistic calculations of molecular electric dipole moments: from light to heavy systems using Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is recognized to be the method of choice to obtain ground state energies of quantum many-body systems in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. This study not only extends the VQE algorithm to the relativistic regime, but also calculates a property other than energy, namely the molecular permanent electric dipole moment (PDM). We carry out 18-qubit quantum simulations to obtain ground state energies as well as PDMs of single-valence diatomic molecules, ranging from the light BeH to the heavy radioactive RaH molecule. We investigate the correlation trends in these systems as well as access the precision in our results. Furthermore, we measure the PDM of the moderately heavy SrH and SrF molecules on the optimized unitary coupled cluster state, using the state-of-the-art IonQ Aria-I quantum computer in an active space of 6 qubits. The associated quantum circuits for these computations were extensively optimized in view of limitations imposed by NISQ hardware. To that end, we employ an array of techniques, including the use of point group symmetries, integrating ZX-Calculus into our pipeline-based circuit optimization, and energy sort VQE procedure. Through these methods, we compress our 6-qubit quantum circuit from 280 two-qubit gates to 37 two-qubit gates (with a marginal trade-off of 0.33 and 0.31 percent in the PDM for SrH and SrF in their respective 6-spin orbital active spaces). We anticipate that our proof-of-concept demonstration lays the groundwork for future quantum hardware calculations involving heavy atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensate source on a optical grating-based atom chip for quantum sensor applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the preparation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) by integrating laser cooling with a grating magneto-optical trap (GMOT) and forced evaporation in a magnetic trap on a single chip. This new approach allowed us to produce a $6 \times 10^4$ atom Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium-87 atoms with a single laser cooling beam. Our results represent a significant advance in the robustness and reliability of cold atom-based inertial sensors, especially for applications in demanding field environments.</description>

      <title>Vapor cell Rydberg atom electrometry with time-separated fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms have large transition electric dipole moments and high sensitivity to electric fields. We describe a new method for microwave field sensing in a vapor cell consisting of separate excitation, quantum evolution between two Rydberg levels in the dark and state-dependent detection with probe laser transmission. Using microwave pulse techniques we study homogeneous and inhomogeneous relaxation of the coherence between Rydberg levels and demonstrate detection of a 10 GHz signal with electric field sensitivity of 10 nV/cm/Hz$^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Emergence of topological states in relaxation dynamics of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological concepts have been employed to understand the ground states of many strongly correlated systems, but it is still quite unclear if and how topology manifests itself in the relaxation dynamics. Here we uncover emergent topological phenomena in the time evolution of far-from-equilibrium one-dimensional interacting bosons. Beginning with simple product states, the system evolves into long-time stationary states with high energy that are nonthermal for a wide range of parameters, and they exhibit nonlocal string correlation that is characteristic of the symmetry-protected topological ground state of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, no topological feature is found in the stationary state as long as the system thermalizes. This difference is further corroborated by the distinct behaviour of quantum entanglement and edge states of the system. Our theoretical prediction can be examined by current experimental techniques and paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of topological phases in nonequilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Relativistic coupled cluster calculations of the electron affinity and ionization potentials of lawrencium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The calculations of the first and the second ionization potentials of lawrencium and lutetium and the electron affinity of lawrencium are performed within the relativistic coupled cluster framework. These results are corrected by including the contributions of extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and higher order contributions due to relativity and electron correlation. The excellent agreement between our predictions of the ionization potentials of Lu and Lr and experimental values supports the accuracy of our predictions of the second ionization potential and the electron affinity of Lr.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Spin-Boson Models with Structured Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, thanks to the presence of both high quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions that can simulate the relevant quantum degrees of freedom. In our work, we extend the previous body of work that focused on coherent coupling of the spins and bosons to perform quantum simulations with structured dissipative baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to fully programmable control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with noise spectral densities constructed from coupling to several dissipative harmonic oscillator modes. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, indicating successful simulation of open quantum systems using a trapped-ion system.</description>
