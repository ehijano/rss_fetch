      <title>Early reduced dopaminergic tone mediated by D3 receptor and dopamine transporter in absence epileptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract Objective In Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats From Strasbourg ( GAERS s), epileptogenesis takes place during brain maturation and correlates with increased mRNA expression of D3 dopamine receptors (D3R). Whether these alterations are the consequence of seizure repetition or contribute to the development of epilepsy remains to be clarified. Here, we addressed the involvement of the dopaminergic system in epilepsy onset in GAERS s. Methods Experiments were performed using rats at different stages of brain maturation from three strains according to their increasing propensity to develop absence seizures: nonepileptic control rats ( NEC s), Wistar Hannover rats, and GAERS s. Changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission were investigated using different behavioral and neurochemical approaches: autoradiography of D3R and dopamine transporter, single photon emission computed tomographic imaging, acute and chronic drug effects on seizure recordings (dopaminergic agonists and antagonists), quinpirole-induced yawns and dopamine synaptosomal uptake, microdialysis, brain tissue monoamines, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor quantification. Results Autoradiography revealed an increased expression of D3R in 14-day-old GAERS s, before absence seizure onset, that persists in adulthood, as compared to age-matched NEC s. This was confirmed by increased yawns, a marker of D3R activity, and increased seizures when animals were injected with quinpirole at low doses to activate D3R. We also observed a concomitant increase in the expression and activity of the dopamine transporter in GAERS s before seizure onset, consistent with both lowered dopamine basal level and increased phasic responses. Significance Our data show that the dopaminergic system is persistently altered in GAERS s, which may contribute not only to behavioral comorbidities but also as an etiopathogenic factor in the development of epilepsy. The data suggest that an imbalanced dopaminergic tone may contribute to absence epilepsy development and seizure onset, as its reversion by a chronic treatment with a dopamine stabilizer significantly suppressed epileptogenesis. Our data suggest a potential new target for antiepileptic therapies and/or improvement of quality of life of epileptic patients.</description>

      <title>Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption that the information from the different potential target locations is statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.</description>

      <title>How to Build the Virtual Cell with Artificial Intelligence: Priorities and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cell is arguably the smallest unit of life and is central to understanding biology. Accurate modeling of cells is important for this understanding as well as for determining the root causes of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with the ability to generate large-scale experimental data, present novel opportunities to model cells. Here we propose a vision of AI-powered Virtual Cells, where robust representations of cells and cellular systems under different conditions are directly learned from growing biological data across measurements and scales. We discuss desired capabilities of AI Virtual Cells, including generating universal representations of biological entities across scales, and facilitating interpretable in silico experiments to predict and understand their behavior using Virtual Instruments. We further address the challenges, opportunities and requirements to realize this vision including data needs, evaluation strategies, and community standards and engagement to ensure biological accuracy and broad utility. We envision a future where AI Virtual Cells help identify new drug targets, predict cellular responses to perturbations, as well as scale hypothesis exploration. With open science collaborations across the biomedical ecosystem that includes academia, philanthropy, and the biopharma and AI industries, a comprehensive predictive understanding of cell mechanisms and interactions is within reach.</description>

      <title>Learning temporal relationships between symbols with Laplace Neural Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firing across populations of neurons in many regions of the mammalian brain maintains a temporal memory, a neural timeline of the recent past. Behavioral results demonstrate that people can both remember the past and anticipate the future over an analogous internal timeline. This paper presents a mathematical framework for building this timeline of the future. We assume that the input to the system is a time series of symbols--sparse tokenized representations of the present--in continuous time. The goal is to record pairwise temporal relationships between symbols over a wide range of time scales. We assume that the brain has access to a temporal memory in the form of the real Laplace transform. Hebbian associations with a diversity of synaptic time scales are formed between the past timeline and the present symbol. The associative memory stores the convolution between the past and the present. Knowing the temporal relationship between the past and the present allows one to infer relationships between the present and the future. With appropriate normalization, this Hebbian associative matrix can store a Laplace successor representation and a Laplace predecessor representation from which measures of temporal contingency can be evaluated. The diversity of synaptic time constants allows for learning of non-stationary statistics as well as joint statistics between triplets of symbols. This framework synthesizes a number of recent neuroscientific findings including results from dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic forebrain.</description>

      <title>The emergence of the width of subjective temporality: the self-simulational theory of temporal extension from the perspective of the free energy principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the width of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the emergence of subjective temporality, along with a Bayesian mechanism for hierarchical duration estimation, from first principles of the physics of self-organization. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two biases (i.e. variations) of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e. the subjective compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of time perception in deep and concentrated states of meditative absorption (i.e. in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, and near death-experiences, amongst others; as well as more general scale-invariant effects of timing and central tendency effects. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the subjective temporal Now emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.</description>

      <title>Spurious reconstruction from brain activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in brain decoding, particularly visual image reconstruction, have sparked discussions about the societal implications and ethical considerations of neurotechnology. As these methods aim to recover visual experiences from brain activity and achieve prediction beyond training samples (zero-shot prediction), it is crucial to assess their capabilities and limitations to inform public expectations and regulations. Our case study of recent text-guided reconstruction methods, which leverage a large-scale dataset (Natural Scene Dataset, NSD) and text-to-image diffusion models, reveals limitations in their generalizability. We found poor performance when applying these methods to a different dataset designed to prevent category overlaps between training and test sets. UMAP visualization of the text features with NSD images showed a limited diversity of semantic and visual clusters, with overlap between training and test sets. Formal analysis and simulations demonstrated that clustered training samples can lead to "output dimension collapse," restricting predictable output feature dimensions. Simulations further showed that diversifying the training set improved generalizability. However, text features alone are insufficient for mapping to the visual space. We argue that recent realistic reconstructions may primarily be a blend of classification into trained categories and generation of inauthentic images through text-to-image diffusion (hallucination). Diverse datasets and compositional representations spanning the image space are essential for genuine zero-shot prediction. Interdisciplinary discussions grounded in understanding the current capabilities and limitations, as well as ethical considerations, of the technology are crucial for its responsible development.</description>

      <title>On the alternatives to the ideal mathematical points-like separatedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper as an alternative to models based on the notion of ideal mathematical point, characterized by a property of separatedness, we considered a viewpoint based on the notion of continuous change, making use of elements of a non-classical logic, in particular the fuzzy sets theory, with events represented as spatiotemporally blurred blobs. Here we point out and discuss a number of aspects of this imperfect symbolic description that might potentially be misleading. Besides that, we analyze its relation to various concepts used commonly to model physical systems, denoted by terms like: point, set, continuous, discrete, infinite, or local, clarifying further how our viewpoint is different and asking whether, in light of our main postulate, any of these notions, or their opposites, if exist, are in their usual meanings suitable to accurately describe the natural phenomena.</description>
