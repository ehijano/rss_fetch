      <title>Computational study of irrational rotations via exact discontinuity tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy sum $D_N(x,\rho)$ for irrational rotations has been of interest to mathematicians for over a century. While historically studied in an ``almost-everywhere'' or asymptotic sense, $D_N$ for finite N is increasingly an object of interest for its nontrivial properties that depend on the Diophantine properties of $\rho$. This behavior is periodic in N with respect to the quotients of the continued fraction convergents, which grow quickly for some irrationals. Thus the stable computation of the sum is necessary for forming conjectures about its properties. However, computing the exact value of the sum and its corresponding probability density function (pdf) is notoriously difficult due to numerical instability in the sum itself and the failure of sampling methods to capture its jump discontinuities. This paper presents a novel computational algorithm that fully defines the discrepancy function and its associated pdf through its discontinuities. This allows the calculation of $D_N(x,\rho)$ to machine precision with minimal storage in O(N) time. This vast improvement in computability over the O(N^2) naive version enables, for the first time, the direct computation of the exact pdf up to machine precision in O(N log N) time, and with it, key properties of the discrepancy: $ \|D_N \|_{\infty}$ (half of the support of the pdf), $ \|D_N \|_{2}^2$ (the variance of the pdf), and the kurtosis of the pdf. A key strength of the algorithm lies in its ability to produce clear, exact figures, allowing the development of mathematical intuition and the quick testing of conjectures. As an example, a newly conjectured pattern is presented: when $\rho$ is well-approximated by rational $\frac{p_n}{q_n}$, the pdf exhibits a predictable spiked-trapezoidal pattern when $N=kq_n$. These shapes degrade as $k$ increases, at a speed depending on how well $\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ approximates $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on gaps between zeros of $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two unconditional upper bounds on the gaps between ordinates of consecutive non-trivial zeros of a general $L$-function $L(s)$. This extends previous work of Hall and Hayman (2000) on the Riemann zeta-function and work of Siegel (1945) on Dirichlet $L$-functions. Interestingly, we observe that while Hall and Hayman's method gives a sharper estimate when the degree of $L(s)$ is sufficiently small compared to the analytic conductor, Siegel's method does better in the other regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a prime $p$, and let $\widehat T_p^{\mathrm{new}}(N,k,\chi) := \chi(p)^{-1/2} p^{-(k-1)/2} T_p^{\mathrm{new}}(N,k,\chi)$ denote the normalized $p$'th Hecke operator over the newspace with nenbentypus $S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N,\chi)$. In this paper, we determine the distribution of the eigenvalues of $\widehat T_p^{\mathrm{new}}(N,k,\chi)$ as $N+k \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Proportion of Atkin-Lehner sign patterns and Hecke Eigenvalue Equidistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N \ge 1$, $k \ge 2$ even, and $\sigma$ denote a sign pattern for $N$. In this paper, we first determine the exact proportion of forms in $S_k(N)$ and $S_k^\mathrm{new}(N)$ with a given Atkin-Lehner sign pattern $\sigma$. Then we study the asymptotic behavior of the Hecke operators $T_p$ over the subspaces of $S_k(N)$ and $S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N)$ with Atkin-Lehner sign pattern $\sigma$. In particular, for the $p$-adic Plancherel measure $\mu_p$, we show that the Hecke eigenvalues for $T_p$ over these subspaces are $\mu_p$-equidistributed as $N+k \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>On the Distribution and Maximal Behavior of $L(1, \chi_D)$ over Hyperelliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the range of uniformity in the double-exponential decay of the tail of the distribution established by Lumley~\cite{Lumley} for the quadratic Dirichlet $L$-function $L(1, \chi_D)$ over the ensemble of hyperelliptic curves of genus~$g$ defined over a fixed finite field~$\mathbb{F}_q$, in the limit as $g \to \infty$. Furthermore, we apply a long resonator method to show that this range of uniformity may persist up to its conjectural level by establishing a double-exponential decay lower bound for the corresponding distribution function.</description>

      <title>The Waring Problem of Complex Binary Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Waring problem of forms concerns the expression of homogeneous multivariate polynomials as sums of powers of linear forms. This paper focuses on complex binary forms, and we solve the Waring problem for them using basic tools in algebra and analysis. In particular, we present elementary treatments of the Apolarity Lemma and Sylvester's 1851 Theorem, which are easily accessible and will provide an ideal approach for future extension to the general case.</description>

      <title>The semi-stable Local Langlands Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start with background that goes into an Iwahori-theoretic reformulation of the mod $p$ Local Langlands Correspondence (\S 2). We then explain some classical $p$-adic functional analytic results (\S 3) that go into defining the $p$-adic Banach space (\S 4) attached to a two-dimensional semi-stable representation $V_{k,{\mathcal L}}$ of the Galois group of ${\mathbb Q}_p$ of weight $k$ and ${\mathcal L}$-invariant ${\mathcal L}$ under the $p$-adic Local Langlands correspondence. We then sketch how to compute the reduction of a lattice in this Banach space, which along with the Iwahori mod $p$ LLC, allows one to completely determine the mod $p$ reduction of $V_{k,{\mathcal L}}$ for all weights $3 \leq k \leq p+1$ and all ${\mathcal L}$ for $p \geq 5$ (\S 5). These notes are a summary of our joint work with Anand Chitrao [CG24]. Emphasis is placed on motivation and background rather than completeness.</description>

      <title>Amplified Fourth Moment of the Riemann Zeta-Function and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twisted fourth moment of the Riemann zeta-function was established by Hughes and Young [J. Reine Angew. Math. 641 (2010), 203--236] and later improved by Bettin, Bui, Li and Radziwill [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) 22 (2020), 3953--3980]. In applications one would often like to take the Dirichlet polynomial to mimic either $1/\zeta^r(s)$ (a mollifier) or $\zeta(s)^r$ (an amplifier) for some $r&gt;0$. Previous known results include the mean value of the fourth power of $\zeta(s)$ times the square or the fourth power of a mollifier, or the square of an amplifier. In this paper we obtain the asymptotic formula for the fourth moment of the Riemann zeta-function times the fourth power of an amplifier. This has various applications to the theory of the Riemann zeta-function, e.g. gaps between zeros of $\zeta(s)$ and lower bounds for moments.</description>

      <title>Linear Combinations of Logarithms of $L$-functions over Function Fields at Microscopic Shifts and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the function field setting with a fixed characteristic, it was proven by the second and third authors that the values $\log \big|L\big(\frac12, \chi_D\big)\big|$ as $D$ varies over monic and square-free polynomials are asymptotically Gaussian distributed on the assumption of a low lying zeros hypothesis as the degree of $D$ tends to $\infty$. For real distinct shifts $t_j$ all of microscopic size or all of nonmicroscopic size relative to the genus, we consider linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, \chi_D\big)\big|$ with real coefficients, and separately, of $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, \chi_D\big).$ We provide estimates for their distribution functions under the low lying zeros hypothesis. We similarly study distribution functions of linear combinations of $\log\big|L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimes \chi_D\big)\big|$, and separately $\arg L\big(\frac12+it_j, E\otimes\chi_D\big)$, for quadratic twists of elliptic curves $E$ with root number one as the conductor gets large. As an application of these results, we prove a central limit theorem for the fluctuation of the number of nontrivial zeros of such $L$-functions from its mean, and thus recover previous results by Faifman and Rudnick. Correlations of such fluctuations are in harmony with the results of Bourgade, Coram and Diaconis, and Wieand for zeros of the Riemann zeta function and for eigenangles of unitary random matrices.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Stirling numbers associated with sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let Y be a random variable whose moment generating function exists in a neighborhood of the origin. Recently, probabilistic Stirling numbers of the first kind and of the second kind associated with Y have been introduced. However, probabilistic stirling number of the first kind based on the cumulant generating function of Y, and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind do not satisfy orthogonality and inverse relations. This paper aims to redefine the probabilistic stirling numbers of the first kind associated with Y such that probabilistic stiirling number of the first kind and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind do satisfy these crucial relations. Furthermore, we investigate their degenerate counterparts, the probabilistic degenerate Stirling numbers of both kinds. We explicitly compute probabilistic stiirling number of the first kind and probabilistic stirling number of the second kind .</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing of Artin $L$-functions associated with $D_4$-quartic function fields ordered by conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low-lying zeros of certain Artin $L$-functions associated with $D_4$-quartic function fields. Specifically, we prove that when ordered by conductor, at least $77\%$ of these $L$-functions are non-vanishing at the central point. This generalises and extends results over $\mathbb{Q}$ due to Durlanik, proving that an infinite number of these $L$-functions are non-vanishing.
  We obtain these results by examining the low-lying zeros of the $L$-functions using the one-level density. Specifically, we apply and extend a method used by Rudnick, who studied Dirichlet $L$-functions associated with quadratic function field extensions, to the $D_4$-case. The main difficulty is studying $L$-functions which are associated to $D_4$-fields whose quadratic subfield is of large discriminant. These $L$-functions are studied by utilising the so-called flipped field of a $D_4$ extension, combining a method introduced by Friedrichsen for counting $D_4$-fields, with explicit ramification theory in such fields provided by Altu\u{g}, Shankar, Varma and Wilson.</description>

      <title>Counting newforms with prescribed ramified supercuspidal components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a formula for the number of newforms in $S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N)$ that have prescribed ramified supercuspidal components $\pi_p$ at a set $T$ of primes dividing $N$. This dimension is given in terms of the trace of the Atkin--Lehner operator at $T$ on $S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N)$. It depends only upon the weight, the level, the ramified quadratic extensions $E_p/{\mathbb Q}_p$ attached to the $\pi_p$, and the root number of each $\pi_p$. The formula is completely explicit when $T$ consists of either a single prime or all prime factors of $N$.</description>

      <title>Optimal bounds for sums of bounded arithmetic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A(s) = \sum_n a_n n^{-s}$ be a Dirichlet series with meromorphic continuation. Say we are given information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s| \leq T$ for some large constant $T$. What is the best way to use such finite spectral data to give explicit estimates on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n$?
  The problem of giving explicit bounds on the Mertens function $M(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} \mu(n)$ illustrates how open this basic question was. Bounding $M(x)$ might seem equivalent to estimating $\psi(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} \Lambda(n)$ or the number of primes $\leq x$. However, we have long had fairly good explicit bounds on prime counts, while bounding $M(x)$ remained a notoriously stubborn problem.
  We prove a sharp, general result on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n n^{-\sigma}$ for $a_n$ bounded, giving an optimal way to use information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s|\leq T$ and no data on the poles above. Our bounds on $M(x)$ are stronger than previous ones by many orders of magnitude. (Similar results for $\psi(x)$ are given in a companion paper.) Using rigorous residue computations by D. Platt, we obtain, for $x\geq 1$, $$|M(x)|\leq \frac{3}{\pi\cdot 10^{10}}\cdot x + 11.39 \sqrt{x}.$$ This is a corollary of our main result, essentially an explicit formula with the contribution of each pole clearly stated; we shall discuss how this finer structure can be useful.
  Our proof mixes a Fourier-analytic approach in the style of Wiener--Ikehara with contour-shifting, using optimal approximants of Beurling--Selberg type (Carneiro--Littmann, 2013); for $\sigma=1$, the approximant in (Vaaler, 1985) reappears. While we proceed independently of existing explicit work on $M(x)$ and $\psi(x)$, our method has an important step in common with work on another problem by (Ramana--Ramar\'e, 2020).</description>

      <title>Sparse Modular Forms, Lattices, and Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by sparseness conditions for holographic CFTs, we investigate sparseness of modular forms, lattices, and codes. For this we investigate the free energy of such objects as their weight, dimension or size goes to infinity. We construct families of modular forms that are sparse, such as the Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(\tau)$. We then investigate lattices that come from codes and introduce a sparseness condition for such lattices. We investigate the limit of lattices constructed from self-dual Reed-Muller codes and provide evidence that they are sparse in this sense.</description>

      <title>Covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and wavefront sets of genuine representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we start by defining a covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and prove some of its properties. Then, for genuine representations of $p$-adic covering groups we formulate an upper bound conjecture for their wavefront sets using this covering Barbasch-Vogan duality and reduce it to anti-discrete representations. The formulation generalizes that of Ciubotaru-Kim and Hazeltine-Liu-Lo-Shahidi for linear algebraic groups. We prove this upper bound conjecture for Kazhdan-Patterson coverings of general linear groups.</description>

      <title>Exponential sums and motivic oscillation index of arbitrary ideals and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2006, Budur, Musta\c{t}\v{a} and Saito introduced the notion of Bernstein-Sato polynomial of an arbitrary scheme of finite type over fields of characteristic zero. Because of the strong monodromy conjecture, it should have a corresponding picture on the arithmetic side of ideals in polynomial rings. In this paper, we try to address this problem. Motivated by the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, we introduce the notions of abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and motivic oscillation index of an arbitrary ideal in polynomial rings over number fields. In the arithmetic picture, the abstract exponential sums modulo $p^m$ and the motivic oscillation index of an ideal should play the role of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial and its maximal non-trivial root of the corresponding scheme. We will provide some properties of the motivic oscillation index of ideals in this paper. On the other hand, based on Igusa's conjecture for exponential sums, we propose the averaged Igusa conjecture for exponential sums of ideals. In particular, this conjecture and the motivic oscillation index of ideals will have many interesting applications. We will introduce these applications and prove some variant version of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Selmer stability for elliptic curves in Galois $\ell$-extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of Selmer groups of an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ in finite Galois extensions with prescribed Galois group. Fix a prime $\ell \geq 5$, a finite group $G$ with $\#G = \ell^n$, and an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with $Sel_\ell(E/\mathbb{Q}) = 0$ and surjective mod-$\ell$ Galois representation. We show that there exist infinitely many Galois extensions $F/\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $Gal(F/\mathbb{Q}) \simeq G$ for which the $\ell$-Selmer group $Sel_\ell(E/F)$ also vanishes. We obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the number $M(G, E; X)$ of such fields $F$ with absolute discriminant $|\Delta_F|\leq X$, proving that there is an explicit constant $\delta&gt;0$ such that $M(G, E; X) \gg X^{\frac{1}{\ell^{n-1}(\ell - 1)}} (\log X)^{\delta - 1}$. The asymptotic for $M(G, E; X)$ matches the conjectural count for all $G$-extensions $F/\mathbb{Q}$ for which $|\Delta_F|\leq X$, up to a power of $\log X$. This demonstrates that Selmer stability is not a rare phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma\subset \bar{\Q}^{\times}$ be a finitely generated multiplicative group of algebraic numbers, let $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m$ be non-zero algebraic numbers, and let $\varepsilon &gt;0$ be fixed. In this paper, we prove that there exist only finitely many tuples $(u_1, \ldots, u_m, q, p)\in \Gamma^m\times\mathbb{Z}^2$ with $d = [\mathbb{Q}(u_1, \ldots, u_m):\mathbb{Q}]$ such that for any two tuples $(u_1,\ldots,u_m)$ and $(u'_1,\ldots,u'_m)$, we have $\frac{u_{i_1}}{u_{i_2}}\neq \frac{u'_{i_1}}{u'_{i_2}}$ for $1\leq i_1\neq i_2\leq m$ and it is stable under Galois conjugation over $\Q$, $\max\{|\alpha_1 qu_1|, \ldots, |\alpha_m qu_m|\}&gt;1$, the tuple $(\alpha_1qu_1, \ldots, \alpha_mq u_m)$ is not pseudo-Pisot and \[0&lt; \left|\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iq u_i - p\right|&lt;\frac{1}{\left(\prod_{i=1}^mH( u_i)\right)^{\varepsilon} |q|^{md+\varepsilon}},\] where $H(u_i)$ denotes the absolute Weil height. This result extends one of the main results of Corvaja-Zannier \cite{corv}. In addition, we prove a result similar to \cite[Theorem 1.4]{kul} in a more general setting. In our proofs, we exploit the subspace theorem based on the work of Corvaja-Zannier.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Ramanujan's formula for sums of half-integer powers of consecutive integers via formal Bernoulli series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faulhaber's formula expresses the sum of the first $n$ positive integers, each raised to an integer power $p\geq 0$, as a polynomial in $n$ of degree $p+1$. Ramanujan expressed this sum for $p\in\{\frac12,\frac32,\frac52,\frac72\}$ as the sum of a polynomial in $\sqrt{n}$ and a certain infinite series. In the present work, we explore the connection to Bernoulli polynomials, and by generalizing those to formal series, we extend the Ramanujan result to all positive half-integers $p$.</description>

      <title>On $q$-Analogs of the $3x+1$ Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10153v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $3x+1$ Conjecture asserts that the $T$-orbit of every positive integer $x$ contains $1$, where $T$ maps $x$ to $x/2$ for $x$ even and to $(3x+1)/2$ for $x$ odd. Several authors have studied the analogous map, $T_q$, which maps $x\in F_2[q]$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $((1+q)x+1)/q$ otherwise. In particular, they showed that the $T_q$-orbit of every polynomial contains $1$. This seems analogous to the $3x+1$ conjecture, but does not prove the conjecture itself, as the dynamical systems involved are not conjugate via any correspondence between polynomials and positive integers.
  In this paper, we show that $T_q$ actually is conjugate to $T$ if we extend their domains to the ring of formal power series $F_2[[q]]$ and the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, respectively. Thus, it is not polynomials that correspond to positive integers via conjugacy, but rather certain formal power series.
  We then generalize this result to the family of functions $T_{A,B}\colon F_2[[q]]\to F_2[[q]]$ mapping $x$ to $x/q$ if $q$ divides $x$ and $(Ax+B)/q$ otherwise, where $A,B\in F_2[[q]]$ are not divisible by $q$. Unlike $T_q$, some of these maps do have the property that polynomials correspond to the positive integers whose $T$-orbit contains $1$ via a conjugacy with $T$. We show that $T_{1,1+q^2}$ is one such map, and has the additional nice property that the orbit of every polynomial enters either the unique $2$-cycle or one of the two fixed points.
  Finally, the power series that correspond to the natural numbers via these conjugacies can be represented as rational numbers with odd denominators by replacing $q$ with $2$ and interpreting the resulting formal series as a 2-adic integer. Finding a simple closed form for even one such correspondence could settle the conjecture itself, and we provide some data along these lines for both $T_{1,1+q^2}$ and $T_q$.</description>

Abstract: Following a recent paper of Anselmo et al., we consider $m \times n$ rectangular matrices formed from the Fibonacci word, and we show that their balance properties can be solved with a finite automaton.

      <description>arXiv:2511.03428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Markov equations are deeply connected with the generalized cluster algebras of Markov type. We construct a deformed Fock-Goncharov tropicalization for the generalized Markov equations and prove that their tropicalized tree structure is essentially the same as that of the classical Euclid tree. We then define the generalized Euclid tree and prove that it converges to the classical Euclid tree up to a scalar multiple. Moreover, by means of cluster mutations, we exhibit an asymptotic phenomenon, up to some limit q, between the logarithmic generalized Markov tree and the classical Euclid tree. A rationality conjecture of q is then put forward. We also propose a generalized Markov uniqueness conjecture for the generalized Markov equations, which illustrates an application of the asymptotic phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We develop a machine for bounding Selmer groups of Galois representations via Euler systems in "non-ordinary" settings, using Pottharst's definition of Selmer groups via Robba-ring $(\varphi, \Gamma)$-modules. Our approach relies on Sweeting's interpretation of Kolyvagin derivative classes via non-principal ultrafilters. We apply these results to prove new cases of the cyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for non-ordinary Rankin--Selberg convolutions.</description>

Abstract: The twin prime conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by two. While recent advances have improved our understanding of bounded prime gaps, the conjecture remains unresolved. This paper refines the weighted sieve method to estimate a sum over twin prime pairs, where each term is of the form \((1/p)(log(x^{{\alpha}}/p))^k\). We establish a strict positive lower bound for this sum, which implies the infinitude of twin prime pairs.</description>

Abstract: In SGA3, Demazure and Grothendieck showed that if $G$ and $H$ are smooth affine group schemes over a scheme $S$ and $G$ is reductive, then the functor of $S$-homomorphism $G \to H$ is representable. In this paper we extend this result to cover cases in which $G$ is not reductive, with much simpler proofs. Our results apply in particular to parabolics over any base, and they are essentially optimal over a field. We also relate the closed orbits in Hom schemes to Serre's theory of complete reducibility, answer a question of Furter--Kraft, and provide many examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite classical group of Lie type of rank $\ell$, defined over a field of characteristic $p&gt;2$. In this work, we classify the irreducible representations of $G$ whose dimensions are bounded by a constant proportional to $\ell$, and splits into two cases according to $G$ is of type $A_{\ell}$ or not. Furthermore, we discuss explicit formulas for computing the dimensions of such representations. The motivation for this work arises, in part, from a desire to obtain new results on two classical problems concerning Galois representations: the large image conjecture for automorphic Galois representations and the inverse Galois problem. We conclude the paper by giving some remarks on potential implications in these addresses.</description>

      <title>Dieudonn\'e theory via classifying stacks and prismatic $F$-gauges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply stack theoretic ideas to the classification problem in Dieudonn\'e theory. First, we use crystalline cohomology of classifying stacks to directly reconstruct the classical Dieudonn\'e module of a finite, $p$-power rank, commutative group scheme $G$ over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. As a consequence, we give a new, much shorter proof of the isomorphism $\sigma^* M(G) \simeq \mathrm{Ext}^1 (G, \mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{crys}})$ due to Berthelot--Breen--Messing using stacky methods combined with the theory of de Rham--Witt complexes. Additionally, we show that finite locally free commutative group schemes of $p$-power rank over a quasisyntomic base can be classified in terms of ``prismatic Dieudonn\'e $F$-gauges", which we introduce by making constructions using (higher) classifying stacks. The latter generalizes the result of Ansch\"utz and Le Bras on classification of $p$-divisible groups, which we also reprove using our approach. Along the way, we prove a description of cohomology with coefficients in group schemes, compatibility with Cartier duality, and reconstruction of Galois representations in terms of our prismatic Dieudonn\'e $F$-gauges.</description>

Abstract: Let $k\in \mathbb Z_+$ and $(X, \mathcal B(X), \mu)$ be a probability space equipped with a family of commuting invertible measure-preserving transformations $T_1,\ldots, T_k \colon X\to X$. Let $P_1,\ldots, P_k\in\mathbb Z[\rm n]$ be polynomials with integer coefficients and distinct degrees. We establish pointwise almost everywhere convergence of the multilinear polynomial ergodic averages \[A_{N; X, T_1,\ldots, T_k}^{P_1,\ldots, P_k}(f_1,\ldots, f_k)(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf_1\big(T_1^{P_1(n)}x\big)\cdots f_k\big(T_k^{P_k(n)}x\big), \qquad x\in X, \]cas $N\to\infty$ for any functions $f_1, \ldots, f_k\in L^{\infty}(X)$. Besides a couple of results in the bilinear setting (when $k=2$ and then only for single transformations), this is the first pointwise result for general polynomial multilinear ergodic averages in arbitrary measure-preserving systems. This answers a question of Bergelson from 1996 in the affirmative for any polynomials with distinct degrees, and makes progress on the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture.
  In this paper, we build a versatile multilinear circle method by developing the Ionescu-Wainger multiplier theorem for the set of canonical fractions, which gives a positive answer to a question of Ionescu and Wainger from 2005. We also establish sharp multilinear $L^p$-improving bounds and an inverse theorem in higher order Fourier analysis for averages over polynomial corner configurations, which we use to establish a multilinear analogue of Weyl's inequality and its real counterpart, a Sobolev smoothing inequality.</description>
