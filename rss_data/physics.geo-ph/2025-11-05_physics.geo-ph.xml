      <title>Hydrogen site-dependent physical properties of hydrous magnesium silicates: implications for water storage and transport in the mantle transition zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth's mantle transition zone (MTZ) is widely recognized as a major water reservoir, exerting significant influence on the planet's water budget and deep cycling processes. Here, we employ crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations to identify a series of stable hydrous magnesium silicate phases under transition zone conditions. Our results reveal a pressure-induced hydrogen substitution mechanism in wadsleyite, where H+ preferentially migrates from Mg2+ sites to Si4+ sites near 410 km depth. This transformation leads to a substantial decrease in electrical conductivity, consistent with geophysical observations. We estimate the water content in the MTZ to be approximately 1.6 wt%, aligning with seismic and conductivity constraints. Furthermore, using machine learning-enhanced molecular dynamics, we discover double superionicity in hydrous wadsleyite and ringwoodite at temperatures exceeding 2000 K, wherein both H+ and Mg2+ exhibit high ionic mobility. This dual-ion superionic state has potentially profound implications for mass transport, electrical conductivity, and magnetic dynamo generation in rocky super-Earth exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian full waveform inversion with learned prior using deep convolutional autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) can be expressed in a Bayesian framework, where the associated uncertainties are captured by the posterior probability distribution (PPD). In practice, solving Bayesian FWI with sampling-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is computationally demanding because of the extremely high dimensionality of the model space. To alleviate this difficulty, we develop a deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE) that serves as a learned prior for the inversion. The CAE compresses detailed subsurface velocity models into a low-dimensional latent representation, achieving more effective and geologically consistent model reduction than conventional dimension reduction approaches. The inversion procedure employs an adaptive gradient-based MCMC algorithm enhanced by automatic differentiation-based FWI to compute gradients efficiently in the latent space. In addition, we implement a transfer learning strategy through online fine-tuning during inversion, enabling the framework to adapt to velocity structures not represented in the original training set. Numerical experiments with synthetic data show that the method can reconstruct velocity models and assess uncertainty with improved efficiency compared to traditional MCMC methods.</description>

      <title>Status of the HENSA collaboration at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory: results from two years of measurement of the neutron flux in hall B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thiswork deals with the characterization of the neutron flux in hall B of the CanfrancUnderground Laboratory (LSC) employing the High Efficiency Neutron Spectrometry Array (HENSA). The ultimate goal of this measurement is to set a limit on the corresponding effects of the neutron flux in the background of the ANAIS-112 experiment. The preliminary neutron counting rates of two years of measurement are reported. Various data analysis techniques, including pulse shape discrimination, are discussed. The first results on the spectral reconstruction of the neutron flux are also presented.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the ability of IceCube DeepCore to probe Earth's interior with atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is an optical Cherenkov detector instrumenting one cubic kilometer of ice at the South Pole. The Cherenkov photons emitted following a neutrino interaction are detected by digital optical modules deployed along vertical strings within the ice. The densely instrumented bottom central region of the IceCube detector, known as DeepCore, is optimized to detect GeV-scale atmospheric neutrinos. As upward-going atmospheric neutrinos pass through Earth, matter effects alter their oscillation probabilities due to coherent forward scattering with ambient electrons. These matter effects depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the density distribution of electrons they encounter during their propagation. Using simulated data at the IceCube Deepcore equivalent to its 9.3 years of observation, we demonstrate that atmospheric neutrinos can be used to probe the broad features of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. In this contribution, we present the preliminary sensitivities for establishing the Earth matter effects, validating the non-homogeneous distribution of Earth's electron density, and measuring the mass of Earth. Further, we also show the DeepCore sensitivity to perform the correlated density measurement of different layers incorporating constraints on Earth's mass and moment of inertia.</description>
