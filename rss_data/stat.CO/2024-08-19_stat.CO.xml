      <title>Dynamic factor analysis for sparse and irregular longitudinal data: an application to metabolite measurements in a COVID-19 study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is of scientific interest to identify essential biomarkers in biological processes underlying diseases to facilitate precision medicine. Factor analysis (FA) has long been used to address this goal: by assuming latent biological pathways drive the activity of measurable biomarkers, a biomarker is more influential if its absolute factor loading is larger. Although correlation between biomarkers has been properly handled under this framework, correlation between latent pathways are often overlooked, as one classical assumption in FA is the independence between factors. However, this assumption may not be realistic in the context of pathways, as existing biological knowledge suggests that pathways interact with one another rather than functioning independently. Motivated by sparsely and irregularly collected longitudinal measurements of metabolites in a COVID-19 study of large sample size, we propose a dynamic factor analysis model that can account for the potential cross-correlations between pathways, through a multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) prior on the factor trajectories. To mitigate against overfitting caused by sparsity of longitudinal measurements, we introduce a roughness penalty upon MOGP hyperparameters and allow for non-zero mean functions. To estimate these hyperparameters, we develop a stochastic expectation maximization (StEM) algorithm that scales well to the large sample size. In our simulation studies, StEM leads across all sample sizes considered to a more accurate and stable estimate of the MOGP hyperparameters than a comparator algorithm used in previous research. Application to the motivating example identifies a kynurenine pathway that affects the clinical severity of patients with COVID-19. In particular, a novel biomarker taurine is discovered, which has been receiving increased attention clinically, yet its role was overlooked in a previous analysis.</description>

      <title>Consistent and Scalable Composite Likelihood Estimation of Probit Models with Crossed Random Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimation of crossed random effects models commonly require computational costs that grow faster than linearly in the sample size $N$, often as fast as $\Omega(N^{3/2})$, making them unsuitable for large data sets. For non-Gaussian responses, integrating out the random effects to get a marginal likelihood brings significant challenges, especially for high dimensional integrals where the Laplace approximation might not be accurate. A formula that is consistent under exact integration may fail to yield consistent estimates when numerical integrations are used. We develop a composite likelihood approach to probit models that replaces the crossed random effects model by some hierarchical models that require only one dimensional integrals. We show how to consistently estimate the crossed effects model parameters from the hierarchical model fits, using recent developments in adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature. We prove that the computation scales linearly in the sample size. We illustrate the method on about five million observations from Stitch Fix where the crossed effects formulation would require an integral of dimension larger than $700{,}000$.</description>

      <title>AdamMCMC: Combining Metropolis Adjusted Langevin with Momentum-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a key issue when considering the application of deep neural network methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that quantifies epistemic uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling from a tempered posterior distribution. It combines the well established Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) with momentum-based optimization using Adam and leverages a prolate proposal distribution, to efficiently draw from the posterior. We prove that the constructed chain admits the Gibbs posterior as an invariant distribution and converges to this Gibbs posterior in total variation distance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting algorithm and the merit of the proposed changes on a state-of-the-art classifier from high-energy particle physics.</description>
