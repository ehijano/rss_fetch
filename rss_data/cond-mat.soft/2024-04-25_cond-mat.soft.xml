      <title>Deep-learning Optical Flow Outperforms PIV in Obtaining Velocity Fields from Active Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based optical flow (DLOF) extracts features in adjacent video frames with deep convolutional neural networks. It uses those features to estimate the inter-frame motions of objects at the pixel level. In this article, we evaluate the ability of optical flow to quantify the spontaneous flows of MT-based active nematics under different labeling conditions. We compare DLOF against the commonly used technique, particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). We obtain flow velocity ground truths either by performing semi-automated particle tracking on samples with sparsely labeled filaments, or from passive tracer beads. We find that DLOF produces significantly more accurate velocity fields than PIV for densely labeled samples. We show that the breakdown of PIV arises because the algorithm cannot reliably distinguish contrast variations at high densities, particularly in directions parallel to the nematic director. DLOF overcomes this limitation. For sparsely labeled samples, DLOF and PIV produce results with similar accuracy, but DLOF gives higher-resolution fields. Our work establishes DLOF as a versatile tool for measuring fluid flows in a broad class of active, soft, and biophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological constraint relaxation in ring-linear polymer blends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers are an effective test-bed for studying topological constraints in condensed matter due to a wide array of synthetically-available chain topologies. When linear and ring polymers are blended together, emergent rheological properties are observed as the blend can be more viscous than either of the individual components. This emergent behavior arises since ring-linear blends can form long-lived topological constraints as the linear polymers thread the ring polymers. Here, we demonstrate how the Gauss linking integral can be used to efficiently evaluate the relaxation of topological constraints in ring-linear polymer blends. For majority-linear blends, the relaxation rate of topological constraints depends primarily on reptation of the linear polymers, resulting in the diffusive time $\tau_{d,R}$ for rings of length $N_R$ blended with linear chains of length $N_l$ to scale as $\tau_{d,R}\sim N_R^2N_L^{3.4}$.</description>

      <title>Polyconvex neural network models of thermoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning function representations such as neural networks have proven to be excellent constructs for constitutive modeling due to their flexibility to represent highly nonlinear data and their ability to incorporate constitutive constraints, which also allows them to generalize well to unseen data. In this work, we extend a polyconvex hyperelastic neural network framework to thermo-hyperelasticity by specifying the thermodynamic and material theoretic requirements for an expansion of the Helmholtz free energy expressed in terms of deformation invariants and temperature. Different formulations which a priori ensure polyconvexity with respect to deformation and concavity with respect to temperature are proposed and discussed. The physics-augmented neural networks are furthermore calibrated with a recently proposed sparsification algorithm that not only aims to fit the training data but also penalizes the number of active parameters, which prevents overfitting in the low data regime and promotes generalization. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated on synthetic data, which illustrate the expected thermomechanical phenomena, and existing temperature-dependent uniaxial tension and tension-torsion experimental datasets.</description>

      <title>Granular jamming gripper with integrated suction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular grippers can manipulate a wide variety of objects, but need to be pressed on the object to conform to it. If the object is placed on unstable ground, e.g., on sand or water, this step might cause the object to sink or move away from the gripper, hindering proper operation. We introduce a granular gripper with an integrated suction cup, where suction and jamming are controlled independently. We demonstrate the system's robust and enhanced gripping capabilities by comparing its grasping performance with a typical granular gripper design. We show that the proposed device can grip objects that are challenging for typical granular grippers, including those placed on unstable ground, as the suction cup stabilizes the object, allowing the gripper to conform.</description>

      <title>Inertia and Activity: Spiral transitions in semi-flexible, self-avoiding polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional, tangentially active, semi-flexible, self-avoiding polymer to find a dynamical re-entrant transition between motile open chains and spinning achiral spirals with increasing activity. Utilizing probability distributions of the turning number, we ascertain the comparative stability of the spiral structure and present a detailed phase diagram within the activity inertia plane. The onset of spiral formation at low activity levels is governed by a torque balance and is independent of inertia. At higher activities, however, inertial effects lead to spiral destabilization, an effect absent in the overdamped limit. We further delineate alterations in size and shape by analyzing the end-to-end distance distribution and the radius of gyration tensor. The Kullback-Leibler divergence from equilibrium distributions exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with activity, reaching a peak at the most compact spirals characterized by the most persistent spinning. As inertia increases, this divergence from equilibrium diminishes.</description>

      <title>Jamming memory into acoustically trained dense suspensions under shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems driven far from equilibrium often retain structural memories of their processing history. This memory has, in some cases, been shown to dramatically alter the material response. For example, work hardening in crystalline metals can alter the hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength to prevent catastrophic failure. Whether memory of processing history can be similarly exploited in flowing systems, where significantly larger changes in structure should be possible, remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a promising route to embedding such useful memories. We build on work showing that exposing a sheared dense suspension to acoustic perturbations of different power allows for dramatically tuning the sheared suspension viscosity and underlying structure. We find that, for sufficiently dense suspensions, upon removing the acoustic perturbations, the suspension shear jams with shear stress contributions from the maximum compressive and maximum extensive axes that reflect the acoustic training. Because the contributions from these two orthogonal axes to the total shear stress are antagonistic, it is possible to tune the resulting suspension response in surprising ways. For example, we show that differently trained sheared suspensions exhibit: 1) different susceptibility to the same acoustic perturbation; 2) orders of magnitude changes in their instantaneous viscosities upon shear reversal; and 3) even a shear stress that increases in magnitude upon shear cessation. To further illustrate the power of this approach for controlling suspension properties, we demonstrate that flowing states well below the shear jamming threshold can be shear jammed via acoustic training. Collectively, our work paves the way for using acoustically induced memory in dense suspensions to generate rapidly and widely tunable materials.</description>

      <title>Microstructural features governing fracture of a two-dimensional amorphous solid identified by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brittle fracturing of materials is common in natural and industrial processes over a variety of length scales. Knowledge of individual particle dynamics is vital to obtain deeper insight into the atomistic processes governing crack propagation in such materials, yet it is challenging to obtain these details in experiments. We propose an experimental approach where isotropic dilational strain is applied to a densely packed monolayer of attractive colloidal microspheres, resulting in fracture. Using brightfield microscopy and particle tracking, we examine the microstructural evolution of the monolayer during fracturing. Furthermore, using a quantified representation of the microstructure in combination with a machine learning algorithm, we calculate the likelihood of regions of the monolayer to be on a crack line, which we term Weakness. From this analysis, we identify the most important contributions to crack propagation and find that local density is more important than orientational order. Our methodology and results provide a basis for further research on microscopic processes during the fracturing process.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing noisy crystal symmetries in coarse-grained computer simulations: New procedures for noise reduction and lattice reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest new modification (we call it a noise reduction procedure) for Steinhardt parameters which are often used for detecting crystalline structures in computer simulation of solids and soft matter systems. We have also developed a new methodology how to reconstruct "ideal" lattice structure in the whole simulation box that would be most close to a real noisy crystalline symmetry, when it is defined locally and then averaged over the whole box. For this second procedure, which we call lattice reconstruction procedure, we have developed an algorithm for finding the lattice vectors from the values of Steinhardt parameters obtained after the noise reduction procedure. We apply noise to the classical crystalline structures (sc, bcc, fcc, hcp), and use both procedures to detect the crystalline structures in these classical but noisy systems. We demonstrate advantages of our procedures in comparison with existing methods and discuss their applicability limits.</description>

      <title>A new non-extensive equation of state for the fluid phases of argon including the metastable states, from the melting line to 2300 K and 50 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:1504.00633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new equation of state for argon has been developed in view to extend the range of validity of the equation of state previously proposed by Tegeler et al. (Ref. 4) and to obtain a better physical description of the experimental thermodynamic data for the whole fluid region (single-phase, metastable and saturation states). As proposed by Tegeler et al., this equation is also based on a functional form of the residual part of the reduced Helmholtz free energy. However in this work, the fundamental equation for the Helmholtz free energy has been derived from the measured quantities CV(rho,T) and P(rho,T). The empirical description of the isochoric heat capacity CV(rho,T) is based on an original empirical description containing explicitly the metastable states. The thermodynamic properties (internal energy, entropy, free energy) are then obtained by combining integration of CV(rho,T). The arbitrary functions introduced by the integration process have been deduced from a comparison between calculated and experimental pressure P(rho,T) data. The new formulation is valid for the whole fluid region from the melting line to 2300 K and for pressures up to 50 GPa. It also predicts existence of a maximum of the isochoric heat capacity CV along isochors as experimentally observed in several other fluids. For many applications, an approximate form of the equation of state for the liquid phase may be sufficient. A Tait-Tammann equation is therefore proposed between the triple point temperature and 148 K.</description>

      <title>Unveiling interatomic distances influencing the reaction coordinates in alanine dipeptide isomerization: An explainable deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work shows that the free energy landscape associated with alanine dipeptide isomerization can be effectively represented by specific interatomic distances without explicit reference to dihedral angles. Conventionally, two stable states of alanine dipeptide in vacuum, i.e., C$7_{\mathrm{eq}}$ ($\beta$-sheet structure) and C$7_{\mathrm{ax}}$ (left handed $\alpha$-helix structure), have been primarily characterized using the main chain dihedral angles, $\varphi$ (C-N-C$_\alpha$-C) and $\psi$ (N-C$_\alpha$-C-N). However, our recent deep learning combined with "Explainable AI" (XAI) framework has shown that the transition state can be adequately captured by a free energy landscape using $\varphi$ and $\theta$ (O-C-N-C$_\alpha$) [T. Kikutsuji, et al. J. Chem. Phys. 156, 154108 (2022)]. In perspective of extending these insights to other collective variables, a more detailed characterization of transition state is required. In this work, we employ the interatomic distances and bond angles as input variables for deep learning, rather than the conventional and more elaborate dihedral angles. Our approach utilizes deep learning to investigate whether changes in the main chain dihedral angle can be expressed in terms of interatomic distances and bond angles. Furthermore, by incorporating XAI into our predictive analysis, we quantified the importance of each input variable and succeeded in clarifying the specific interatomic distance that affects the transition state. The results indicate that constructing a free energy landscape based on using the identified interatomic distance can clearly distinguish between the two stable states and provide a comprehensive explanation for the energy barrier crossing.</description>

      <title>A unified analytical prediction for steady-state behavior of confined drop with interface viscosity under shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we fill in the blanks in the theory of drops under shear flow by unifying analytical predictions for steady-state behavior proposed by Flumerfelt [R. W. Flumerfelt, J. Colloid Interface Sci. 76, 330 (1980)] for unconfined drops with interface viscosity with the one of Shapira &amp; Haber [M. Shapira and S. Haber, Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 16, 305 (1990)] for confined drops without interface viscosity. Our predictions for both steady-state drop deformation and inclination angle are broadly valid for situations involving confined/unconfined drops, with/without interface viscosity and viscosity ratio, thus making our model so general that it can include any of the above conditions.</description>
