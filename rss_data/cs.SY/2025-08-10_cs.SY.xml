      <title>A United Framework for Planning Electric Vehicle Charging Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for establishing sustainable and low-emission urban transportation systems. However, the success of this transition depends on the strategic placement of the charging infrastructure. This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing charging station locations in dense urban environments while balancing efficiency with spatial accessibility. We propose an optimization framework that integrates traffic simulation, energy consumption modeling, and a mobility equity measure to evaluate the social reach of each potential charging station. Using New York City as a case study, we demonstrate consistent improvements in accessibility (15-20% reduction in travel time variability). Our results provide a scalable methodology for incorporating equity considerations into EV infrastructure planning, although economic factors and grid integration remain important areas for future development.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization and Learning for Automated Stepsize Selection with Finite Time Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optimization and learning algorithms are designed to operate over large scale networks enabling processing of vast amounts of data effectively and efficiently. One of the main challenges for ensuring a smooth learning process in gradient-based methods is the appropriate selection of a learning stepsize. Most current distributed approaches let individual nodes adapt their stepsizes locally. However, this may introduce stepsize heterogeneity in the network, thus disrupting the learning process and potentially leading to divergence. In this paper, we propose a distributed learning algorithm that incorporates a novel mechanism for automating stepsize selection among nodes. Our main idea relies on implementing a finite time coordination algorithm for eliminating stepsize heterogeneity among nodes. We analyze the operation of our algorithm and we establish its convergence to the optimal solution. We conclude our paper with numerical simulations for a linear regression problem, showcasing that eliminating stepsize heterogeneity enhances convergence speed and accuracy against current approaches.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantized Average Consensus in Open Multi-Agent Systems with Dynamic Communication Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the distributed quantized average consensus problem in open multi-agent systems consisting of communication links that change dynamically over time. Open multi-agent systems exhibiting the aforementioned characteristic are referred to as \textit{open dynamic multi-agent systems} in this work. We present a distributed algorithm that enables active nodes in the open dynamic multi-agent system to calculate the quantized average of their initial states. Our algorithm consists of the following advantages: (i) ensures efficient communication by enabling nodes to exchange quantized valued messages, and (ii) exhibits finite time convergence to the desired solution. We establish the correctness of our algorithm and we present necessary and sufficient topological conditions for it to successfully solve the quantized average consensus problem in an open dynamic multi-agent system. Finally, we illustrate the performance of our algorithm with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Panel-Scale Reconfigurable Photonic Interconnects for Scalable AI Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panel-scale reconfigurable photonic interconnects on a glass substrate up to 500-mm x 500-mm or larger are envisioned by proposing a novel photonic switch fabric that enables all directional panel-edge-to-panel-edge reach without the need for active repeaters while offering high communication bandwidth, planar-direction reconfigurability, low energy consumption, and compelling data bandwidth density for heterogeneous integration of an in-package AI computing system on a single glass-substrate photonic interposer exceeding thousands of centimeters square. The proposed approach focuses on reconfigurable photonic interconnects, which are integration-compatible with commercial processor chiplets and 3D high-bandwidth memory (HBM) stacks on a large-area glass substrate, to create a novel panel-scale heterogeneously integrated interposer or package enabling low-energy and high-capacity wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) optical data links using advanced high-speed optical modulators, broadband photodetectors, novel optical crossbar switches with multi-layer waveguides, and in-package frequency comb sources.</description>

      <title>Random Walk Learning and the Pac-Man Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.</description>

      <title>Semantic Reasoning Meets Numerical Precision: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Inherently Safer AGI through Language-Mediated Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations. We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the system's core design through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety measures.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Barrier-Rate Guided MPPI Control for Tractor-Trailer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Articulated vehicles such as tractor-trailers, yard trucks, and similar platforms must often reverse and maneuver in cluttered spaces where pedestrians are present. We present how Barrier-Rate guided Model Predictive Path Integral (BR-MPPI) control can solve navigation in such challenging environments. BR-MPPI embeds Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints directly into the path-integral update. By steering the importance-sampling distribution toward collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories, BR-MPPI enhances the exploration strength of MPPI and improves robustness of resulting trajectories. The method is evaluated in the high-fidelity CarMaker simulator on a 12 [m] tractor-trailer tasked with reverse and forward parking in a parking lot. BR-MPPI computes control inputs in above 100 [Hz] on a single GPU (for scenarios with eight obstacles) and maintains better parking clearance than a standard MPPI baseline and an MPPI with collision cost baseline.</description>

      <title>Integrating Vision Foundation Models with Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Object Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that integrates vision foundation models with reinforcement learning to enhance object interaction capabilities in simulated environments. By combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and YOLOv5 with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent operating in the AI2-THOR simulation environment, we enable the agent to perceive and interact with objects more effectively. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across four diverse indoor kitchen settings, demonstrate significant improvements in object interaction success rates and navigation efficiency compared to a baseline agent without advanced perception. The results show a 68% increase in average cumulative reward, a 52.5% improvement in object interaction success rate, and a 33% increase in navigation efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of integrating foundation models with reinforcement learning for complex robotic tasks, paving the way for more sophisticated and capable autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Density Steering via the Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the data-driven chance-constrained density steering problem using the Gromov-Wasserstein metric. The underlying dynamical system is an unknown linear controlled recursion, with the assumption that sufficiently rich input-output data from pre-operational experiments are available. The initial state is modeled as a Gaussian mixture, while the terminal state is required to match a specified Gaussian distribution. We reformulate the resulting optimal control problem as a difference-of-convex program and show that it can be efficiently and tractably solved using the DC algorithm. Numerical results validate our approach through various data-driven schemes.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization via RC-ALADIN with Efficient Quantized Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of decentralized consensus optimization over directed graphs with limited communication bandwidth. We introduce a novel decentralized optimization algorithm that combines the Reduced Consensus Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (RC-ALADIN) method with a finite time quantized coordination protocol, enabling quantized information exchange among nodes. Assuming the nodes' local objective functions are $\mu$-strongly convex and simply smooth, we establish global convergence at a linear rate to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with the neighborhood size determined by the quantization level. Additionally, we show that the same convergence result also holds for the case where the local objective functions are convex and $L$-smooth. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm compares favorably against algorithms in the current literature while exhibiting communication efficient operation.</description>

      <title>SCAR: State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource Management in 6G-Enabled Vehicular Infotainment Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of 6G networks opens new possibilities for connected infotainment services in vehicular environments. However, traditional Radio Resource Management (RRM) techniques struggle with the increasing volume and complexity of data such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQI) from autonomous vehicles. To address this, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Driven Resource Management), an Edge AI-assisted framework that optimizes scheduling and fairness in vehicular infotainment. SCAR employs ML-based compression techniques (e.g., clustering and RBF networks) to reduce CQI data size while preserving essential features. These compressed states are used to train 6G-enabled Reinforcement Learning policies that maximize throughput while meeting fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulations show that SCAR increases time in feasible scheduling regions by 14\% and reduces unfair scheduling time by 15\% compared to RL baselines without CQI compression. Furthermore, Simulated Annealing with Stochastic Tunneling (SAST)-based clustering reduces CQI clustering distortion by 10\%, confirming its efficiency. These results demonstrate SCAR's scalability and fairness benefits for dynamic vehicular networks.</description>

      <title>A "good regulator theorem" for embodied agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a classic paper, Conant and Ashby claimed that "every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system." Artificial Life has produced many examples of systems that perform tasks with apparently no model in sight; these suggest Conant and Ashby's theorem doesn't easily generalise beyond its restricted setup. Nevertheless, here we show that a similar intuition can be fleshed out in a different way: whenever an agent is able to perform a regulation task, it is possible for an observer to interpret it as having "beliefs" about its environment, which it "updates" in response to sensory input. This notion of belief updating provides a notion of model that is more sophisticated than Conant and Ashby's, as well as a theorem that is more broadly applicable. However, it necessitates a change in perspective, in that the observer plays an essential role in the theory: models are not a mere property of the system but are imposed on it from outside. Our theorem holds regardless of whether the system is regulating its environment in a classic control theory setup, or whether it's regulating its own internal state; the model is of its environment either way. The model might be trivial, however, and this is how the apparent counterexamples are resolved.</description>

Abstract: This note aims to provide a systematic investigation of direct data-driven control, enriching the existing literature not by adding another isolated result, but rather by offering a unifying, versatile, and broad framework that enables the generation of novel results in this domain. We formulate the nonlinear design problem from a high-level perspective as a set of desired controlled systems and propose systematic procedures to synthesize data-driven control algorithms that meet the specified design requirements. Various examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach and its ability to derive new insights and results, illustrating the novel contributions enabled by the framework.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Selection in Replicator Equations Using Adaptive-Gain Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the equilibrium selection problem, which amounts to steering a population of individuals engaged in strategic game-theoretic interactions to a desired collective behavior. In the literature, this problem has been typically tackled by means of open-loop strategies, whose applicability is however limited by the need of accurate a priori information on the game and scarce robustness to uncertainty and noise. Here, we overcome these limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain control scheme within a replicator equation -a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the population. For most classes of 2-action matrix games we establish sufficient conditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator equation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a-priori information on the game. Numerical simulations corroborate and expand our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03875v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Observability and Generalized Sensor Placement for Nonlinear Quality Models in Drinking Water Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04202v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of optimal placement of water quality (WQ) sensors in water distribution networks (WDNs), with a focus on chlorine transport, decay, and reaction models. Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements (SP) that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a greedy algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic systems and observability theory, and yields SPs that are submodular and robust to hydraulic changes. Case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10359v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a tutorial overview and an extension of a recently developed framework for data-driven control of unknown nonlinear systems with rigorous closed-loop guarantees. The proposed approach relies on the Koopman operator representation of the nonlinear system, for which a bilinear surrogate model is estimated based on data. In contrast to existing Koopman-based estimation procedures, we state guaranteed bounds on the approximation error using the stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) framework. The resulting surrogate model and the uncertainty bounds allow us to design controllers via robust control theory and sum-of-squares optimization, guaranteeing desirable properties for the closed-loop system. We present results on stabilization both in discrete and continuous time, and we derive a method for controller design with performance objectives. The benefits of the presented framework over established approaches are demonstrated with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>A Linear Differential Inclusion for Contraction Analysis to Known Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinitesimal contraction analysis provides exponential convergence rates between arbitrary pairs of trajectories of a system by studying the system's linearization. An essentially equivalent viewpoint arises through stability analysis of a linear differential inclusion (LDI) encompassing the incremental behavior of the system. In this note, we use contraction tools to study the exponential stability of a system to a particular known trajectory, deriving a new LDI characterizing the error between arbitrary trajectories and this known trajectory. As with classical contraction analysis, this new inclusion is constructed via first partial derivatives of the system's vector field, and convergence rates are obtained with familiar tools: uniform bounding of the logarithmic norm and LMI-based Lyapunov conditions. Our LDI is guaranteed to outperform a usual contraction analysis in two special circumstances: i) when the bound on the logarithmic norm arises from an interval overapproximation of the Jacobian matrix, and ii) when the norm considered is the $\ell_1$ norm. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach strictly improves an existing framework for ellipsoidal reachable set computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of verifying safety for continuous-time dynamical systems. Developing upon recent advancements in data-driven verification, we use only a finite number of sampled trajectories to learn a barrier certificate, namely a function which verifies safety. We train a safety-informed neural network to act as this certificate, with an appropriately designed loss function to encompass the safety conditions. In addition, we provide probabilistic generalisation guarantees from discrete samples of continuous trajectories, to unseen continuous ones. Numerical investigations demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and contrast it with related results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Integrative, Scalable Modeling of Hydrological Systems with MBSE and HFGT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Worsening global challenges in the Anthropocene demand complex, adaptive solutions grounded in a systems-level understanding of coupled social and environmental dynamics. However, existing modeling approaches often fall short due to disciplinary silos, limited scalability, and the absence of shared ontological frameworks. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), when integrated with Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT), offers a powerful methodology for modeling systems of systems while preserving subsystem heterogeneity and enabling cross-disciplinary integration. This paper presents the first application of the MBSE-HFGT methodology to environmental systems, using a series of worked examples involving flow through lake and land segments. These examples demonstrate how the approach enables consistent, scalable, and integrative modeling of complex environmental processes.</description>

      <title>Spatial Association Between Near-Misses and Accident Blackspots in Sydney, Australia: A Getis-Ord $G_i^*$ Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional road safety management is inherently reactive, relying on analysis of sparse and lagged historical crash data to identify hazardous locations, or crash blackspots. The proliferation of vehicle telematics presents an opportunity for a paradigm shift towards proactive safety, using high-frequency, high-resolution near-miss data as a leading indicator of crash risk. This paper presents a spatial-statistical framework to systematically analyze the concordance and discordance between official crash records and near-miss events within urban environment. A Getis-Ord statistic is first applied to both reported crashes and near-miss events to identify statistically significant local clusters of each type. Subsequently, Bivariate Local Moran's I assesses spatial relationships between crash counts and High-G event counts, classifying grid cells into distinct profiles: High-High (coincident risk), High-Low and Low-High. Our analysis reveals significant amount of Low-Crash, High-Near-Miss clusters representing high-risk areas that remain unobservable when relying solely on historical crash data. Feature importance analysis is performed using contextual Point of Interest data to identify the different infrastructure factors that characterize difference between spatial clusters. The results provide a data-driven methodology for transport authorities to transition from a reactive to a proactive safety management strategy, allowing targeted interventions before severe crashes occur.</description>

      <title>Latency-Optimal File Assignment in Geo-Distributed Storage with Preferential Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of data storage in a geographically distributed (or geo-distributed) network of servers (or nodes) where inter-node communication incurs certain round-trip delays. Every node serves a set of users who can request any file in the network. If the requested file is not available at the node, it communicates with other nodes to obtain the file, thus causing the user to experience latency in obtaining the file. The files can be placed uncoded, where each node stores exact copies of the files, or in coded fashion, where certain linear combination of files are placed at each node. We aim to obtain an optimal file placement on the nodes with respect to minimizing the worst-case latency at each node, as well as the system-average latency. The prior literature considered the case of equiprobable file demands at the nodes. In this paper, we investigate the generic case of non-uniform file-demand probabilities at each node. The scheme presented here is optimal within the family of uncoded schemes. It is obtained first by modeling the worst-case latency constraint as a vertex coloring problem, and then converting the system-average latency optimization to a problem of balanced-assignment.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Network Security Policies via Belief Aggregation and Rollout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolving security vulnerabilities and shifting operational conditions require frequent updates to network security policies. These updates include adjustments to incident response procedures and modifications to access controls, among others. Reinforcement learning methods have been proposed for automating such policy adaptations, but most of the methods in the research literature lack performance guarantees and adapt slowly to changes. In this paper, we address these limitations and present a method for computing security policies that is scalable, offers theoretical guarantees, and adapts quickly to changes. It assumes a model or simulator of the system and comprises three components: belief estimation through particle filtering, offline policy computation through aggregation, and online policy adaptation through rollout. Central to our method is a new feature-based aggregation technique, which improves scalability and flexibility. We analyze the approximation error of aggregation and show that rollout efficiently adapts policies to changes under certain conditions. Simulations and testbed results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, including CAGE-2.</description>

Abstract: Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are essential for providing accurate navigation and timing information worldwide. Operating in medium Earth orbit (MEO), these satellites must maintain precise Earth-pointing attitudes to transmit signals effectively. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the operational dynamics, attitude determination and control systems (ADCS), and orbital insertion techniques for GPS satellites. We explore the integration of sensors and actuators, control algorithms, stabilization strategies, and the launch procedures required to deploy these satellites. Key equations related to orbital mechanics and attitude control are discussed, and references to recent technical literature are included.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of an Active Quarter Car Suspension with a Robust LQR Controller under Road Disturbance and Parameter Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicle suspension is important for passengers to travel comfortably and to be less exposed to effects such as vibration and shock. A good suspension system increases the road holding of vehicles, allows them to take turns safely, and reduces the risk of traffic accidents. A passive suspension system is the most widely used suspension system in vehicles due to its simple structure and low cost. Passive suspension systems do not have an actuator and therefore do not have a controller. Active suspension systems have an actuator and a controller. Although their structures are more complex and costly, they are safer. PID controller is widely used in active suspension systems due to its simple structure, reasonable cost, and easy adjustment of coefficients. In this study, a more robust LQR-controlled active suspension was designed than a passive suspension and a PID-controlled active suspension. Robustness analyses were performed for passive suspension, PID-controlled active suspension, and LQR-controlled active suspension. Suspension travel, sprung mass acceleration, and sprung mass motion simulations were performed for all 3 suspensions under road disturbance and under simultaneous road disturbance and parameter uncertainty. A comparative analysis was performed by obtaining the suspension rise time, overshoot, and settling time data. It was observed that the LQR-controlled active suspension showed the least overshoot and had the shortest settling time. In this case, it was proven that the LQR controlled active suspension provided a more comfortable and safe ride compared to the other two suspension systems.</description>

      <title>Off-Policy Evaluation for Sequential Persuasion Process with Unobserved Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand the Bayesian persuasion framework to account for unobserved confounding variables in sender-receiver interactions. While traditional models assume that belief updates follow Bayesian principles, real-world scenarios often involve hidden variables that impact the receiver's belief formation and decision-making. We conceptualize this as a sequential decision-making problem, where the sender and receiver interact over multiple rounds. In each round, the sender communicates with the receiver, who also interacts with the environment. Crucially, the receiver's belief update is affected by an unobserved confounding variable. By reformulating this scenario as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), we capture the sender's incomplete information regarding both the dynamics of the receiver's beliefs and the unobserved confounder. We prove that finding an optimal observation-based policy in this POMDP is equivalent to solving for an optimal signaling strategy in the original persuasion framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this reformulation facilitates the application of proximal learning for off-policy evaluation in the persuasion process. This advancement enables the sender to evaluate alternative signaling strategies using only observational data from a behavioral policy, thus eliminating the necessity for costly new experiments.</description>

      <title>Unified Multi-Rate Model Predictive Control for a Jet-Powered Humanoid Robot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for a jet-powered flying humanoid robot. The controller is based on a linearised centroidal momentum model to represent the flight dynamics, augmented with a second-order nonlinear model to explicitly account for the slow and nonlinear dynamics of jet propulsion. A key contribution is the introduction of a multi-rate MPC formulation that handles the different actuation rates of the robot's joints and jet engines while embedding the jet dynamics directly into the predictive model. We validated the framework using the jet-powered humanoid robot iRonCub, performing simulations in Mujoco; the simulation results demonstrate the robot's ability to recover from external disturbances and perform stable, non-abrupt flight manoeuvres, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>
