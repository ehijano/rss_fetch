      <title>Observation of Jones-Roberts solitons in a paraxial quantum fluid of ligh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and dynamics of Jones-Roberts solitons in a smoothly inhomogeneous quantum fluid. To do so, we create a superfluid of light using paraxial, near-resonant laser beam propagating through a hot rubidium vapor. We excite a bounded vortex-antivortex dipole in the superfluid and observe its transition to a rarefaction pulse and back, in agreement with the seminal predictions of Jones and Roberts. Employing an analogy with ray optics, we calculate the trajectory of the interacting vortices, deriving an effective refractive index from the inhomogeneous fluid density. Finally, we examine analytically and experimentally the superfluid velocity correlations, observing a transfer of coherence from incompressible to compressible velocity of the quantum fluid, a direct signature of the dynamical conversion between vortices and rarefaction pulse.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Fermi Polarons Driven by Time-dependent Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically studied the dynamics of Fermi polarons driven by time-dependent scattering length using a time-dependent variational method. Starting from the non-interacting initial state, we calculated the evolution behavior of the contact, energy, and quasiparticle residue of this system as the scattering length $a_s(t)$ increases from zero. In the short-time evolution, we obtained analytical results, verifying that when $a_s(t)$ grows as $\sqrt{t}$, the contact $C(t)$ and energy $E(t)$ exhibit the maximum growth rate. Furthermore, we numerically solved the long-time evolution, when $a_s(t)$ is diven with a strength $\beta$ and a power $\alpha$ as $a_s(t) = {\sqrt{2}\beta}/{k_F} {(\epsilon_Ft)}^{\alpha}$. For large driving strength, due to the interference between the polaron states and the non-interacting states, $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ exhibit oscillatory behavior; For small $\beta$, the oscillatory behavior disappears due to the decay of the repulsive polaron into the continuum, and $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ gradually relax to zero. The energy always saturates over long times for different driving strength. Additionally, our method is applicable to any time-dependent form of the scattering length.</description>

      <title>Self-sustained Josephson dynamics and self-trapping in supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the self-sustained Josephson junction dynamics in dipolar supersolids, predicting the possibility of self-trapping alongside the experimentally observed Josephson oscillations [Biagioni, G. et al., Nature 629, 773 (2024)]. Using an asymmetric two-mode (ATM) model to describe a triangular dipolar supersolid, validated through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we demonstrate that the system's symmetry enables a consistent two-mode mapping despite the presence of seven droplets. Additionally, we show that bringing the system into rotation preserves its ability to sustain the Josephson junction dynamics across its full range, and we assess the robustness of the ATM model under these conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We find that the linear deviation from steady states is memory-less, similar to the closed system. The linear response of observables while ramping the Hamiltonian is still related to the derivative of the retarded Green's function. However, as one ramps the dissipation, the corresponding coefficient is determined by a new high-order correlation function in the steady state. Our work gives a neat result and generalizes the tool of ramping dynamics to study the many-body correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional spin Hall effect in $\mathcal {PT}$ symmetric spin-orbit coupled quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the intrinsic spin Hall effect in $\mathcal {PT}$ symmetric, spin-orbit coupled quantum gases confined in an optical lattice. The interplay of the $\mathcal {PT}$ symmetry and the spin-orbit coupling leads to a doubly degenerate non-interacting band structure in which the spin polarization and the Berry curvature of any Bloch state are opposite to those of its degenerate partner. Using experimentally available systems as examples, we show that such a system with a two-component Fermi gas exhibits an intrinsic spin Hall effect akin to that discussed in the context of electronic materials. For a two-component Bose gas, however, an unconventional spin Hall effect emerges in which the spin polarization and the currents are coplanar and the spin Hall conductivity displays a characteristic anisotropy. We propose to detect such an unconventional spin Hall effect in harmonically trapped systems by means of dipole oscillations and perform extensive numerical simulations to verify this proposal. Our work paves the way for the quantum simulation of solid-state intrinsic spin Hall effect and for experimental explorations of unconventional spin Hall effects in quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization to non-Gibbs states in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that equilibrium energy distributions in many-body chaotic systems can be qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions. This effect can appear in systems with finite energy spectra, which support both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum degeneracy, when the eigenstates fill a substantial part of the Hilbert space. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Periodically-Driven Dissipative Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), featured by the collapse of bulk-band eigenstates into the localized boundary modes of the systems, is one of most striking properties in the fields of non-Hermitian physics. Unique physical phenomena related to the NHSE have attracted a lot of interest, however, their experimental realizations usually require nonreciprocal hopping, which faces a great challenge in ultracold-atom systems. In this work, we propose to realize the NHSE in a 1D optical lattice by periodically-driven ultracold atoms in the presence of staggered atomic loss. By studying the effective Floquet Hamiltonian in the high-frequency approximation, we reveal the underlying mechanism for the periodic-driving-induced the NHSE. We found that the robust NHSE can be tuned by driving phase, which is manifested by the dynamical localization. Most remarkably, we uncover the periodic-driving-induced critical skin effect for two coupled chains with different driving phases, accompanied by the appearance of size-dependent topological in-gap modes. Our studies provide a feasible way for observing the NHSE and exploring corresponding unique physical phenomena due to the interplay of non-Hermiticity and many-body statistics in ultracold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Superfluid fraction of interacting bosonic gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superfluid fraction $f$ of a quantum fluid is defined in terms of the response of the system to a weak and constant drag. Notably, Leggett long ago derived two simple expressions providing a rigorous upper bound and a heuristic lower bound for $f$. Here we study the superfluid fraction of bosonic gases in various two-dimensional potentials, such as regular optical lattices and disordered speckles, by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and performing Diffusion Monte Carlo simulations. We show that under conditions relevant for most ultracold experiments the bounds proposed by Leggett provide a surprisingly narrow bracketing of the exact value of the superfluid fraction.</description>

      <title>Observation of Relaxation Stages in a Nonequilibrium Closed Quantum System: Decaying Turbulence in a Trapped Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of non-equilibrium closed quantum systems and their route to thermalization are of fundamental interest to several fields, from cosmology to particle physics. However, a comprehensive description of non-equilibrium phenomena still presents a significant challenge. In this work, we report the observation of distinct stages during the relaxation of the decaying turbulence in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. Our findings show a direct particle cascade from low to high momenta, a consequence of the energy injection in the system, exhibiting a characteristic universal scaling. This stage is followed by an inverse particle cascade responsible for repopulating the previously depleted condensate. Both cascades can be explained through self-similar solutions provided by wave turbulence theory. These findings provide important insights into the relaxation stages of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Two- and many-body physics of ultracold molecules dressed by dual microwave fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the two- and many-body physics of the ultracold polar molecules dressed by dual microwaves with distinct polarizations. Using Floquet theory and multichannel scattering calculations, we identify a regime with the largest elastic-to-inelastic scattering ratio which is favorable for performing evaporative cooling. Furthermore, we derive and, subsequently, validate an effective interaction potential that accurately captures the dynamics of microwave-shielded polar molecules (MSPMs). We also explore the ground-state properties of the ultracold gases of MSPMs by computing physical quantities such as gas density, condensate fraction, momentum distribution, and second-order correlation. It is shown that the system supports a weakly correlated expanding gas state and a strongly correlated self-bound gas state. Since the dual-microwave scheme introduces addition control knob and is essential for creating ultracold Bose gases of polar molecules, our work pave the way for studying two- and many-body physics of the ultracold polar molecules dressed by dual microwaves.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic response in dipole superfluids: vortex lattices and singular domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the most significant macroscopic quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics is the Meissner effect observed in superconductivity, which arises from the unique interaction between superfluids of charged particles and electromagnetic fields. However, superfluids can also emerge from particles possessing distinct electromagnetic properties. In particular, there has been growing interest in superfluids composed of charge-neutral particles with magnetic or electric dipole moments, such as Bose-Einstein condensates of magnons or excitons. Despite this interest, the electromagnetic response of dipole superfluids, including potential analogs or contrasts to the Meissner effect, remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological theory to describe magnetic and electric dipole superfluids subjected to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by geometric phases. For magnetic dipole superfluids interacting with the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase, we find that they form vortex lattices with sharply localized pseudo-magnetic fields along hexagonal domain walls, leading to singular and discontinuous change of physical variables at these boundaries. For electric dipole superfluids influenced by the He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) phase, in contrast, we identify vortex lattices where the pseudo-magnetic field and supercurrent are concentrated at vortex cores, resembling superconductors. These results reveal strikingly different electromagnetic responses in dipole superfluids, opening new directions for exploring superfluid systems with unconventional electromagnetic responses.</description>
