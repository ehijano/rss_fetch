      <title>Auto-Calibration and 2D-DOA Estimation in UCAs via an Integrated Wideband Dictionary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel auto-calibration scheme for the joint estimation of the two-dimensional (2-D) direction-of-arrival (DOA) and the mutual coupling matrix (MCM) for a signal measured using uniform circular arrays. The method employs an integrated wideband dictionary to mitigate the detrimental effects of the discretization of the continuous parameter space over the considered azimuth and elevation angles. This leads to a reduction of the computational complexity and obtaining of more accurate DOA estimates. Given the more reliable DOA estimates, the method also allows for the estimation of more accurate mutual coupling coefficients. The method utilizes an integrated dictionary in order to iteratively refine the active parameter space, thereby reducing the required computational complexity without reducing the overall performance. The complexity is further reduced by employing only the dominant subspace of the measured signal. Furthermore, the proposed method does not require a constraint on the prior knowledge of the number of nonzero coupling coefficients nor suffer from ambiguity problems. Moreover, a simple formulation for 2-D non-numerical integration is presented. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Sub-6GHz Assisted mmWave Hybrid Beamforming with Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In next-generation communications, sub-6GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) links typically coexist, with the sub-6GHz link always active and the mmWave link active when high-rate transmission is required. Due to the spatial similarities between sub-6GHz and mmWave channels, sub-6GHz channel information can be utilized to support hybrid beamforming in mmWave communications to reduce overhead costs. We consider a multi-cell heterogeneous communication network where both sub-6GHz and mmWave communications co-exist. Multiple mmWave base stations (BSs) in the heterogeneous network simultaneously transmit signals to multiple users in their own mmWave cells while interfering with each other. The challenging problem is to design hybrid beamformers in the mmWave band that can maximize the system spectral efficiency. To address this highly complex programming using sub-6GHz information, a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) architecture is proposed to learn the intrinsic relationship between sub-6GHz and mmWave and design the hybrid beamformers for mmWave BSs. The proposed HGNN consists of two different node types, namely, BS nodes and user equipment (UE) nodes, and two different edge types, namely, desired link edge and interfering link edge. In addition, the attention mechanism and the residual structure are utilized in the HGNN architecture to improve the performance. Simulation results show that the proposed HGNN can successfully achieve better performances with sub-6GHz information than traditional learning methods. The results also demonstrate that the attention mechanism and residual structure improve the performances of the HGNN compared to its unmodified counterparts.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Near-Field Channel Estimation for Hybrid RIS Assisted Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the channel estimation (CE) problem for hybrid RIS assisted systems and focus on the near-field (NF) regime. Different from their far-field counterparts, NF channels possess a block-sparsity property, which is leveraged in the two developed CE algorithms: (i) boundary estimation and sub-vector recovery (BESVR) and (ii) linear total variation regularization (TVR). In addition, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers to reduce their computational complexity. Numerical results show that the linear TVR algorithm outperforms the chosen baseline schemes in terms of normalized mean square error in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime while the BESVR algorithm achieves comparable performance to the baseline schemes but with the added advantage of minimal CPU time.</description>

      <title>Sugarcane Health Monitoring With Satellite Spectroscopy and Machine Learning: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research into large-scale crop monitoring has flourished due to increased accessibility to satellite imagery. This review delves into previously unexplored and under-explored areas in sugarcane health monitoring and disease/pest detection using satellite-based spectroscopy and Machine Learning (ML). It discusses key considerations in system development, including relevant satellites, vegetation indices, ML methods, factors influencing sugarcane reflectance, optimal growth conditions, common diseases, and traditional detection methods. Many studies highlight how factors like crop age, soil type, viewing angle, water content, recent weather patterns, and sugarcane variety can impact spectral reflectance, affecting the accuracy of health assessments via spectroscopy. However, these variables have not been fully considered in the literature. In addition, the current literature lacks comprehensive comparisons between ML techniques and vegetation indices. We address these gaps in this review. We discuss that, while current findings suggest the potential for an ML-driven satellite spectroscopy system for monitoring sugarcane health, further research is essential. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of previous research to aid in unlocking this potential and advancing the development of an effective sugarcane health monitoring system using satellite technology.</description>

      <title>Structured Reinforcement Learning for Delay-Optimal Data Transmission in Dense mmWave Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the data packet transmission problem (mmDPT) in dense cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) networks, i.e., users sending data packet requests to access points (APs) via uplinks and APs transmitting requested data packets to users via downlinks. Our objective is to minimize the average delay in the system due to APs' limited service capacity and unreliable wireless channels between APs and users. This problem can be formulated as a restless multi-armed bandits problem with fairness constraint (RMAB-F). Since finding the optimal policy for RMAB-F is intractable, existing learning algorithms are computationally expensive and not suitable for practical dynamic dense mmWave networks. In this paper, we propose a structured reinforcement learning (RL) solution for mmDPT by exploiting the inherent structure encoded in RMAB-F. To achieve this, we first design a low-complexity and provably asymptotically optimal index policy for RMAB-F. Then, we leverage this structure information to develop a structured RL algorithm called mmDPT-TS, which provably achieves an \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) Bayesian regret. More importantly, mmDPT-TS is computation-efficient and thus amenable to practical implementation, as it fully exploits the structure of index policy for making decisions. Extensive emulation based on data collected in realistic mmWave networks demonstrate significant gains of mmDPT-TS over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Channel Modeling for FR3 Upper Mid-band via Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upper mid-band (FR3) has been recently attracting interest for new generation of mobile networks, as it provides a promising balance between spectrum availability and coverage, which are inherent limitations of the sub 6GHz and millimeter wave bands, respectively. In order to efficiently design and optimize the network, channel modeling plays a key role since FR3 systems are expected to operate at multiple frequency bands. Data-driven methods, especially generative adversarial networks (GANs), can capture the intricate relationships among data samples, and provide an appropriate tool for FR3 channel modeling. In this work, we present the architecture, link state model, and path generative network of GAN-based FR3 channel modeling. The comparison of our model greatly matches the ray-tracing simulated data.</description>

      <title>Sensor Response-Time Reduction using Long-Short Term Memory Network Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response time of a biosensor is a crucial metric in safety-critical applications such as medical diagnostics where an earlier diagnosis can markedly improve patient outcomes. However, the speed at which a biosensor reaches a final equilibrium state can be limited by poor mass transport and long molecular diffusion times that increase the time it takes target molecules to reach the active sensing region of a biosensor. While optimization of system and sensor design can promote molecules reaching the sensing element faster, a simpler and complementary approach for response time reduction that is widely applicable across all sensor platforms is to use time-series forecasting to predict the ultimate steady-state sensor response. In this work, we show that ensembles of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks can accurately predict equilibrium biosensor response from a small quantity of initial time-dependent biosensor measurements, allowing for significant reduction in response time by a mean and median factor of improvement of 18.6 and 5.1, respectively. The ensemble of models also provides simultaneous estimation of uncertainty, which is vital to provide confidence in the predictions and subsequent safety-related decisions that are made. This approach is demonstrated on real-time experimental data collected by exposing porous silicon biosensors to buffered protein solutions using a multi-channel fluidic cell that enables the automated measurement of 100 porous silicon biosensors in parallel. The dramatic improvement in sensor response time achieved using LSTM network ensembles and associated uncertainty quantification opens the door to trustworthy and faster responding biosensors, enabling more rapid medical diagnostics for improved patient outcomes and healthcare access, as well as quicker identification of toxins in food and the environment.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Time-Frequency Representation Discriminators for High-Fidelity Vocoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based vocoders are superior in both inference speed and synthesis quality when reconstructing an audible waveform from an acoustic representation. This study focuses on improving the discriminator for GAN-based vocoders. Most existing Time-Frequency Representation (TFR)-based discriminators are rooted in Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which owns a constant Time-Frequency (TF) resolution, linearly scaled center frequencies, and a fixed decomposition basis, making it incompatible with signals like singing voices that require dynamic attention for different frequency bands and different time intervals. Motivated by that, we propose a Multi-Scale Sub-Band Constant-Q Transform CQT (MS-SB-CQT) discriminator and a Multi-Scale Temporal-Compressed Continuous Wavelet Transform CWT (MS-TC-CWT) discriminator. Both CQT and CWT have a dynamic TF resolution for different frequency bands. In contrast, CQT has a better modeling ability in pitch information, and CWT has a better modeling ability in short-time transients. Experiments conducted on both speech and singing voices confirm the effectiveness of our proposed discriminators. Moreover, the STFT, CQT, and CWT-based discriminators can be used jointly for better performance. The proposed discriminators can boost the synthesis quality of various state-of-the-art GAN-based vocoders, including HiFi-GAN, BigVGAN, and APNet.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Modulation for RIS-assisted Symbiotic Radios: Design, Analysis, and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted symbiotic radio (SR), an RIS is exploited to assist the primary system and to simultaneously operate as a secondary transmitter by modulating its own information over the incident primary signal from the air. Such an operation is called over-the-air modulation. The existing modulation schemes such as on-off keying and binary phase-shift keying suffer from two problems for joint detection of the primary and secondary signals in RIS-assisted SR, i.e., one is the detection ambiguity problem when the direct link is blocked, and the other is the bit error rate (BER) error-floor problem when the direct link is weak. To address the two problems, we propose a novel modulation scheme by dividing the phase-shift matrix into two parts: one is the assistance beamforming matrix for assisting the primary system and the other is the transmission beamforming matrix for delivering the secondary signal. To optimize the assistance and transmission beamforming matrices, we first introduce an assistance factor that describes the performance requirement of the primary system and then formulate a problem to minimize the BER of the secondary system, while guaranteeing the BER requirement of the primary system controlled by the assistance factor. To solve this non-convex problem, we resort to the successive convex approximation technique to obtain a suboptimal solution. Furthermore, to draw more insights, we propose a low-complexity assistance-transmission beamforming structure by borrowing the idea from the classical maximum ratio transmission and zero forcing techniques. Finally, simulation results reveal an interesting tradeoff between the BER performance of the primary and secondary systems by adjusting the assistance factor.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Target Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a distributed implementation for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) backed by a massive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) architecture without cells. Distributed multi-antenna access points (APs) simultaneously serve communication users (UEs) and emit probing signals towards multiple specified zones for sensing. The APs can switch between communication and sensing modes, and adjust their transmit power based on the network settings and sensing and communication operations' requirements. By considering local partial zero-forcing and maximum-ratio-transmit precoding at the APs for communication and sensing, respectively, we first derive closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of the UEs and the mainlobe-to-average-sidelobe ratio (MASR) of the sensing zones. Then, a joint operation mode selection and power control design problem is formulated to maximize the SE fairness among the UEs, while ensuring specific levels of MASR for sensing zones. The complicated mixed-integer problem is relaxed and solved via successive convex approximation approach. We further propose a low-complexity design, where AP mode selection is designed through a greedy algorithm and then power control is designed based on this chosen mode. Our findings reveal that the proposed scheme can consistently ensure a sensing success rate of $100\%$ for different network setups with a satisfactory fairness among all UEs.</description>

      <title>Empirical Studies of Propagation Characteristics and Modeling Based on XL-MIMO Channel Measurement: From Far-Field to Near-Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the sixth-generation (6G), the extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is considered a promising enabling technology. With the further expansion of array element number and frequency bands, near-field effects will be more likely to occur in 6G communication systems. The near-field radio communications (NFRC) will become crucial in 6G communication systems. It is known that the channel research is very important for the development and performance evaluation of the communication systems. In this paper, we will systematically investigate the channel measurements and modeling for the emerging NFRC. First, the principle design of massive MIMO channel measurement platform are solved. Second, an indoor XL-MIMO channel measurement campaign with 1600 array elements is conducted, and the channel characteristics are extracted and validated in the near-field region. Then, the outdoor XL-MIMO channel measurement campaign with 320 array elements is conducted, and the channel characteristics are extracted and modeled from near-field to far-field (NF-FF) region. The spatial non-stationary characteristics of angular spread at the transmitting end are more important in modeling. We hope that this work will give some reference to the near-field and far-field research for 6G.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance bounds of near-field sensing are studied for circular arrays, focusing on the impact of bandwidth and array size. The closed-form Cramer-Rao bound (CRBs) for angle and distance estimation are derived, revealing the scaling laws of the CRBs with bandwidth and array size. Contrary to expectations, enlarging array size does not always enhance sensing performance. Furthermore, the asymptotic CRBs are analyzed under different conditions, unveiling that the derived expressions include the existing results as special cases. Finally, the derived expressions are validated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Multi-Chip Wireless Networks with Near-Field Time Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) has emerged as a potential solution to address the escalating communication demands of modern computing systems due to their low-latency, versatility, and reconfigurability. However, for WNoC to fulfill its potential, it is essential to establish multiple high-speed wireless links across chips. Unfortunately, the compact and enclosed nature of computing packages introduces significant challenges in the form of Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which not only hinder the deployment of multiple spatial channels but also severely restrict the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this paper, we posit that Time Reversal (TR) could be effective in addressing both impairments in this static scenario thanks to its spatiotemporal focusing capabilities even in the near field. Through comprehensive full-wave simulations and bit error rate analysis in multiple scenarios and at multiple frequency bands, we provide evidence that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude, enabling the deployment of multiple concurrent links and achieving aggregate speeds exceeding 100 Gb/s. Finally, we evaluate the impact of reducing the sampling rate of the TR filter on the achievable speeds, paving the way to practical TR-based wireless communications at the chip scale.</description>

      <title>The CARFAC v2 Cochlear Model in Matlab, NumPy, and JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open-source CARFAC (Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators with Fast-Acting Compression) cochlear model is upgraded to version 2, with improvements to the Matlab implementation, and with new Python/NumPy and JAX implementations -- but C++ version changes are still pending. One change addresses the DC (direct current, or zero frequency) quadratic distortion anomaly previously reported; another reduces the neural synchrony at high frequencies; the others have little or no noticeable effect in the default configuration. A new feature allows modeling a reduction of cochlear amplifier function, as a step toward a differentiable parameterized model of hearing impairment. In addition, the integration into the Auditory Model Toolbox (AMT) has been extensively improved, as the prior integration had bugs that made it unsuitable for including CARFAC in multi-model comparisons.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Deepcode, a learned feedback code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have recently been used to construct non-linear codes for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. However, there is limited understanding of how these black-box-like codes with many learned parameters use feedback. This study aims to uncover the fundamental principles underlying the first deep-learned feedback code, known as Deepcode, which is based on an RNN architecture. Our interpretable model based on Deepcode is built by analyzing the influence length of inputs and approximating the non-linear dynamics of the original black-box RNN encoder. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our interpretable model -- which includes both an encoder and a decoder -- achieves comparable performance to Deepcode while offering an interpretation of how it employs feedback for error correction.</description>

      <title>A Novel Context driven Critical Integrative Levels (CIL) Approach: Advancing Human-Centric and Integrative Lighting Asset Management in Public Libraries with Practical Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the context driven Critical Integrative Levels (CIL), a novel approach to lighting asset management in public libraries that aligns with the transformative vision of human-centric and integrative lighting. This approach encompasses not only the visual aspects of lighting performance but also prioritizes the physiological and psychological well-being of library users. Incorporating a newly defined metric, Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE), the approach quantifies user-light interaction, enabling tailored lighting strategies that respond to diverse activities and needs in library spaces. Case studies demonstrate how the CIL matrix can be practically applied, offering significant improvements over conventional methods by focusing on optimized user experiences from both visual impacts and non-visual effects.</description>

      <title>The LuViRA Dataset: Synchronized Vision, Radio, and Audio Sensors for Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a synchronized multisensory dataset for accurate and robust indoor localization: the Lund University Vision, Radio, and Audio (LuViRA) Dataset. The dataset includes color images, corresponding depth maps, inertial measurement unit (IMU) readings, channel response between a 5G massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) testbed and user equipment, audio recorded by 12 microphones, and accurate six degrees of freedom (6DOF) pose ground truth of 0.5 mm. We synchronize these sensors to ensure that all data is recorded simultaneously. A camera, speaker, and transmit antenna are placed on top of a slowly moving service robot, and 89 trajectories are recorded. Each trajectory includes 20 to 50 seconds of recorded sensor data and ground truth labels. Data from different sensors can be used separately or jointly to perform localization tasks, and data from the motion capture (mocap) system is used to verify the results obtained by the localization algorithms. The main aim of this dataset is to enable research on sensor fusion with the most commonly used sensors for localization tasks. Moreover, the full dataset or some parts of it can also be used for other research areas such as channel estimation, image classification, etc. Our dataset is available at: https://github.com/ilaydayaman/LuViRA_Dataset</description>

      <title>Battery Capacity Knee-Onset Identification and Early Prediction Using Degradation Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abrupt capacity fade can have a significant impact on performance and safety in battery applications. To address concerns arising from possible knee occurrence, this work aims for a better understanding of their cause by introducing a new definition of capacity knees and their onset. A curvature-based identification of a knee and its onset is proposed, which relies on the discovery of a distinctly fluctuating behavior in the transition between an initial and a final stable acceleration of the degradation. The method is validated on experimental degradation data of two different battery chemistries, synthetic degradation data, and is also benchmarked to the state-of-the-art knee identification method in the literature. The results demonstrate that our proposed method could successfully identify capacity knees when the state-of-the-art knee identification method failed. Furthermore, a significantly strong correlation is found between knee and end of life (EoL) and almost equally strong between knee onset and EoL. As the method does not require the full capacity fade curve, this opens up online knee-onset identification as well as knee and EoL prediction.</description>

      <title>4D Millimeter-Wave Radar in Autonomous Driving: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04242v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar, proficient in measuring the range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity of targets, has attracted considerable interest within the autonomous driving community. This is attributed to its robustness in extreme environments and the velocity and elevation measurement capabilities. However, despite the rapid advancement in research related to its sensing theory and application, there is a conspicuous absence of comprehensive surveys on the subject of 4D mmWave radar. In an effort to bridge this gap and stimulate future research, this paper presents an exhaustive survey on the utilization of 4D mmWave radar in autonomous driving. Initially, the paper provides reviews on the theoretical background and progress of 4D mmWave radars, encompassing aspects such as the signal processing workflow, resolution improvement approaches, and extrinsic calibration process. Learning-based radar data quality improvement methods are present following. Then, this paper introduces relevant datasets and application algorithms in autonomous driving perception, localization and mapping tasks. Finally, this paper concludes by forecasting future trends in the realm of 4D mmWave radar in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically dedicated to the 4D mmWave radar in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>DoA-Aided MMSE Channel Estimation for Wireless Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the combination of parametric channel estimation with minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation. We propose a direction-of-arrival (DoA)-aided two-stage channel estimation technique that utilizes the decomposition of wireless communication channels into a line-of-sight (LoS) path and its orthogonal subspace. After estimating the channel along the dominant direction, we utilize a Gaussian mixture model to estimate the conditionally Gaussian distributed random vector, which represents the multipath propagation. The proposed two-stage estimator allows pre-computing the respective estimation filters, tremendously reducing the computational complexity. Numerical simulations with typical channel models depict the superior performance of our proposed two-stage estimation approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-RIS Assisted Multi-User XL-MIMO Systems: Hybrid Beamforming Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06966v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel estimation is one of the key challenges for the deployment of extremely large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (XL-RIS) assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we study the channel estimation problem for XL-RIS assisted multi-user XL-MIMO systems with hybrid beamforming structures. For this system, we propose an {\em unified} channel estimation method that yields a notable estimation accuracy in the near-field BS-RIS and near-field RIS-User channels (in short, near-near field channels), far-near field channels, and far-far field channels. Our key idea is that the effective (or cascaded) channels to be estimated can be each factorized as the product of low-rank matrices (i.e., the product of the common (or user-independent) matrix and the user-specific coefficient matrix). The common matrix whose columns are the basis of the column space of the BS-RIS channel matrix is efficiently estimated via a {\em collaborative} low-rank approximation (CLRA). Leveraging the hybrid beamforming structures, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the user-specific coefficient matrices. Via experiments and complexity analysis, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation method (named CLRA-JO) in the aforementioned three classes of wireless channels.</description>

      <title>One-Bit Target Detection in Collocated MIMO Radar with Colored Background Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-bit sampling has emerged as a promising technique in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems due to its ability to significantly reduce data volume and processing requirements. Nevertheless, current detection methods have not adequately addressed the impact of colored noise, which is frequently encountered in real scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel detection method that accounts for colored noise in MIMO radar systems. Specifically, we derive Rao's test by computing the derivative of the likelihood function with respect to the target reflectivity parameter and the Fisher information matrix, resulting in a detector that takes the form of a weighted matched filter. To ensure the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property, we also consider noise covariance uncertainty and examine its effect on the probability of false alarm. The detection probability is also studied analytically. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed detector provides considerable performance gains in the presence of colored noise.</description>

Abstract: Constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences have modulus one and ideal periodic autocorrelation function. Such sequences are used in cellular radio communications systems, e.g., for reference signals, synchronization signals and random access preambles. We propose a new family CAZAC sequences, which is constructed by interleaving a Zadoff-Chu sequence by a quadratic permutation polynomial (QPP), or by a permutation polynomial whose inverse is a QPP. It is demonstrated that a set of orthogonal interleaved Zadoff-Chu sequences can be constructed by proper choice of QPPs.</description>

      <title>Modulation Design and Optimization for RIS-Assisted Symbiotic Radios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted symbiotic radio (SR), the RIS acts as a secondary transmitter by modulating its information bits over the incident primary signal and simultaneously assists the primary transmission, then a cooperative receiver is used to jointly decode the primary and secondary signals. Most existing works of SR focus on using RIS to enhance the reflecting link while ignoring the ambiguity problem for the joint detection caused by the multiplication relationship of the primary and secondary signals. Particularly, in case of a blocked direct link, joint detection will suffer from severe performance loss due to the ambiguity, when using the conventional on-off keying and binary phase shift keying modulation schemes for RIS. To address this issue, we propose a novel modulation scheme for RIS-assisted SR that divides the phase-shift matrix into two components: the symbol-invariant and symbol-varying components, which are used to assist the primary transmission and carry the secondary signal, respectively. To design these two components, we focus on the detection of the composite signal formed by the primary and secondary signals, through which a problem of minimizing the bit error rate (BER) of the composite signal is formulated to improve both the BER performance of the primary and secondary ones. By solving the problem, we derive the closed-form solution of the optimal symbol-invariant and symbol-varying components, which is related to the channel strength ratio of the direct link to the reflecting link. Moreover, theoretical BER performance is analyzed. Finally, simulation results show the superiority of the proposed modulation scheme over its conventional counterpart.</description>

      <title>Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enhanced Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In opportunistic cognitive radio networks, when the primary signal is very weak compared to the background noise, the secondary user requires long sensing time to achieve a reliable spectrum sensing performance, leading to little remaining time for the secondary transmission. To tackle this issue, we propose an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted spectrum sensing system, where the received signal strength from the interested primary user can be enhanced and underlying interference within the background noise can be mitigated as well. In comparison with the passive RIS, the active RIS can not only adapt the phase shift of each reflecting element but also amplify the incident signals. Notably, we study the reflecting coefficient matrix (RCM) optimization problem to improve the detection probability given a maximum tolerable false alarm probability and limited sensing time. Then, we show that the formulated problem can be equivalently transformed to a weighted mean square error minimization problem using the principle of the well-known weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, and an iterative optimization approach is proposed to obtain the optimal RCM. In addition, to fairly compare passive RIS and active RIS, we study the required power budget of the RIS to achieve a target detection probability under a special case where the direct links are neglected and the RIS-related channels are line-of-sight. Via extensive simulations, the effectiveness of the WMMSE-based RCM optimization approach is demonstrated. Furthermore, the results reveal that the active RIS can outperform the passive RIS when the underlying interference within the background noise is relatively weak, whereas the passive RIS performs better in strong interference scenarios because the same power budget can support a vast number of passive reflecting elements for interference mitigation.</description>

Abstract: Neural wearables can enable life-saving drowsiness and health monitoring for pilots and drivers. While existing in-cabin sensors may provide alerts, wearables can enable monitoring across more environments. Current neural wearables are promising but most require wet-electrodes and bulky electronics. This work showcases in-ear, dry-electrode earpieces used to monitor drowsiness with compact hardware. The employed system integrates additive-manufacturing for dry, user-generic earpieces, existing wireless electronics, and offline classification algorithms. Thirty-five hours of electrophysiological data were recorded across nine subjects performing drowsiness-inducing tasks. Three classifier models were trained with user-specific, leave-one-trial-out, and leave-one-user-out splits. The support-vector-machine classifier achieved an accuracy of 93.2% while evaluating users it has seen before and 93.3% when evaluating a never-before-seen user. These results demonstrate wireless, dry, user-generic earpieces used to classify drowsiness with comparable accuracies to existing state-of-the-art, wet electrode in-ear and scalp systems. Further, this work illustrates the feasibility of population-trained classification in future electrophysiological applications.</description>

      <title>Transmitter Side Beyond-Diagonal RIS for mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work initiates the study of a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS)-aided transmitter architecture for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. Deploying BD-RIS at the transmitter side not only alleviates the need for extensive fully digital radio frequency (RF) chains but also enhances both communication and sensing performance. These benefits are facilitated by the additional design flexibility introduced by the fully-connected scattering matrix of BD-RIS. To achieve the aforementioned benefits, in this work, we propose an efficient two-stage algorithm to design the digital beamforming of the transmitter and the scattering matrix of the BD-RIS with the aim of jointly maximizing the sum rate for multiple communication users and minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multiple sensing targets. Numerical results show that the transmitter-side BD-RIS-aided mmWave ISAC outperforms the conventional diagonal-RIS-aided ones in both communication and sensing performance.</description>
