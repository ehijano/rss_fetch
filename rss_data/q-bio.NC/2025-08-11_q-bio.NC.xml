      <title>Diverse Neural Sequences in QIF Networks: An Analytically Tractable Framework for Synfire Chains and Hippocampal Replay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential neural activity is fundamental to cognition, yet how diverse sequences are recalled under biological constraints remains a key question. Existing models often struggle to balance biophysical realism and analytical tractability. We address this problem by proposing a parsimonious network of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with sequences embedded via a temporally asymmetric Hebbian (TAH) rule. Our findings demonstrate that this single framework robustly reproduces a spectrum of sequential activities, including persistent synfire-like chains and transient, hippocampal replay-like bursts exhibiting intra-ripple frequency accommodation (IFA), all achieved without requiring specialized delay or adaptation mechanisms. Crucially, we derive exact low-dimensional firing-rate equations (FREs) that provide mechanistic insight, elucidating the bifurcation structure governing these distinct dynamical regimes and explaining their stability. The model also exhibits strong robustness to synaptic heterogeneity and memory pattern overlap. These results establish QIF networks with TAH connectivity as an analytically tractable and biologically plausible platform for investigating the emergence, stability, and diversity of sequential neural activity in the brain.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Graph Representation of fMRI Data for Cognitive Brain State Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and classifying human cognitive brain states based on neuroimaging data remains one of the foremost and most challenging problems in neuroscience, owing to the high dimensionality and intrinsic noise of the signals. In this work, we propose an ensemble-based graph representation method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the task of binary brain-state classification. Our method builds the graph by leveraging multiple base machine-learning models: each edge weight reflects the difference in posterior probabilities between two cognitive states, yielding values in the range [-1, 1] that encode confidence in a given state. We applied this approach to seven cognitive tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Subject Release), including working memory, gambling, motor activity, language, social cognition, relational processing, and emotion processing. Using only the mean incident edge weights of the graphs as features, a simple logistic-regression classifier achieved average accuracies from 97.07% to 99.74%. We also compared our ensemble graphs with classical correlation-based graphs in a classification task with a graph neural network (GNN). In all experiments, the highest classification accuracy was obtained with ensemble graphs. These results demonstrate that ensemble graphs convey richer topological information and enhance brain-state discrimination. Our approach preserves edge-level interpretability of the fMRI graph representation, is adaptable to multiclass and regression tasks, and can be extended to other neuroimaging modalities and pathological-state classification.</description>

      <title>Low dimensional dynamics of a sparse balanced synaptic network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetics of a balanced network of neurons with a sparse grid of synaptic links is well representable by the stochastic dynamics of a generic neuron subject to an effective shot noise. The rate of delta-pulses of the noise is determined self-consistently from the probability density of the neuron states. Importantly, the most sophisticated (but robust) collective regimes of the network do not allow for the diffusion approximation, which is routinely adopted for a shot noise in mathematical neuroscience. These regimes can be expected to be biologically relevant. For the kinetics equations of the complete mean field theory of a homogeneous inhibitory network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, we introduce circular cumulants of the genuine phase variable and derive a rigorous two cumulant reduction for both time-independent conditions and modulation of the excitatory current. The low dimensional model is examined with numerical simulations and found to be accurate for time-independent states and dynamic response to a periodic modulation deep into the parameter domain where the diffusion approximation is not applicable. The accuracy of a low dimensional model indicates and explains a low embedding dimensionality of the macroscopic collective dynamics of the network. The reduced model can be instrumental for theoretical studies of inhibitory-excitatory balances neural networks.</description>

      <title>Integrating large language models and active inference to understand eye movements in reading and dyslexia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel computational model employing hierarchical active inference to simulate reading and eye movements. The model characterizes linguistic processing as inference over a hierarchical generative model, facilitating predictions and inferences at various levels of granularity, from syllables to sentences. Our approach combines the strengths of large language models for realistic textual predictions and active inference for guiding eye movements to informative textual information, enabling the testing of predictions. The model exhibits proficiency in reading both known and unknown words and sentences, adhering to the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in dual route theories of reading. Our model therefore provides a novel approach to understand the cognitive processes underlying reading and eye movements, within a predictive processing framework. Furthermore, our model can potentially aid in understanding how maladaptive predictive processing can produce reading deficits associated with dyslexia. As a proof of concept, we show that attenuating the contribution of priors during the reading process leads to incorrect inferences and a more fragmented reading style, characterized by a greater number of shorter saccades, aligning with empirical findings regarding eye movements in dyslexic individuals. In summary, our model represents a significant advancement in comprehending the cognitive processes involved in reading and eye movements, with potential implications for understanding dyslexia in terms of maladaptive inference.</description>
