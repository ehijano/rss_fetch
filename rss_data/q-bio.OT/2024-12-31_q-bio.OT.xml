      <title>Hilbert Curve Based Molecular Sequence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20616</link>

Abstract: Accurate molecular sequence analysis is a key task in the field of bioinformatics. To apply molecular sequence classification algorithms, we first need to generate the appropriate representations of the sequences. Traditional numeric sequence representation techniques are mostly based on sequence alignment that faces limitations in the form of lack of accuracy. Although several alignment-free techniques have also been introduced, their tabular data form results in low performance when used with Deep Learning (DL) models compared to the competitive performance observed in the case of image-based data. To find a solution to this problem and to make Deep Learning (DL) models function to their maximum potential while capturing the important spatial information in the sequence data, we propose a universal Hibert curve-based Chaos Game Representation (CGR) method. This method is a transformative function that involves a novel Alphabetic index mapping technique used in constructing Hilbert curve-based image representation from molecular sequences. Our method can be globally applied to any type of molecular sequence data. The Hilbert curve-based image representations can be used as input to sophisticated vision DL models for sequence classification. The proposed method shows promising results as it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by achieving a high accuracy of $94.5$\% and an F1 score of $93.9\%$ when tested with the CNN model on the lung cancer dataset. This approach opens up a new horizon for exploring molecular sequence analysis using image classification methods.</description>

      <title>Genome hybridization: A universal way for the origin and diversification of organelles as well as the origin and speciation of eukaryotes</title>

Abstract: The origin of organelles (mitochondrion, chloroplast and nucleus) remains enigmatic. The endosymbiotic hypothesis that chloroplasts, mitochondria and nuclei descend from the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium, bacterium and archaebacterium respectively is dominant yet uncompelling, while our discovery of de novo organelle biogenesis in the cyanobacterium TDX16 that had acquired the genome of its green algal host Haematococcus pluvialis overturns this hypothesis. In light of organelle biogenesis in the cyanobacterium TDX16 in combination with the relevant cellular and molecular evidence, we propose genome hybridization hypothesis (GHH) that the origin of organelles and origin of eukaryotes as well as the diversification of organelles and speciation of eukaryotes are unified and achieved by genome hybridization: the endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or bacteria obtain genomes of their archaebacterial or eukaryotic hosts and hybridize with their own ones resulting in expanded genomes containing a mixture of hybrid prokaryotic genes and eukaryotic genes, and thus the cyanobacteria or bacteria have to compartmentalize to accommodate different genes for specialized function of photosynthesis (chloroplast), respiration (mitochondrion) and DNA preservation (nucleus), and consequently turn into photosynthetic or heterotrophic eukaryotes. Accordingly, eukaryotes and their organelles are of multiple origin, while the formation of cancer cells is the speciation of eukaryotes as cancer cells are new species of unicellular eukaryotes arising from bacteria. Therefore, GHH provides a theoretical framework unifying evolutionary biology, cancer biology and cell biology and directing the integrated multidisciplinary research.</description>
