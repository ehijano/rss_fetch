      <title>Information About Other Players in Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of mechanism design settings where the social planner has an interest in players receiving noisy signals about the types of other agents. When the social planner is interested only in partial implementation, any social choice rule that is incentive compatible after players receive additional information about other agents was originally incentive compatible prior to the change in information structure. However, information about other agents can eliminate undesired equilibria in an implementing mechanism. Thus, there are social choice rules which are not fully implementable in a given information environment that become fully implementable after players have additional information about the types of other agents. We provide some general conditions under which an undesired equilibrium can be eliminated by additional information about other players.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to "Transitive Regret"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theorem 1 in Bikhchandani &amp; Segal (2011; Theoretical Economics) suggests that a complete, transitive, monotonic, and continuous preference is regret based if and only if it is expected utility. Their Proposition 1 suggests that transitivity and continuity of a regret-based preference implies an equivalence condition: if random variables $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution, then $X\sim Y$. We give counterexamples to Proposition 1.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria of games with generalized complementarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To generalize complementarities for games, we introduce some conditions weaker than quasisupermodularity and the single crossing property. We prove that the Nash equilibria of a game satisfying these conditions form a nonempty complete lattice. This is a purely order-theoretic generalization of Zhou's theorem.</description>

      <title>Random Attention and Unobserved Reference Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I develop and characterize a random attention model with unobserved reference alternatives. The decision maker pays attention to different subsets of the available set of alternatives randomly. The reference alternatives are exactly those alternatives that are always paid attention to, i.e. they are attention-privileged and these alternatives are supposed to be unknown to the outside observer. The characterization allows for a complete identification of the reference alternatives and a coarse identification of the underlying preferences. I then restrict the model by considering the independent random attention function and provide a complete identification of the underlying preferences as well.

      <title>Contractual Reinforcement Learning: Pulling Arms with Invisible Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The agency problem emerges in today's large scale machine learning tasks, where the learners are unable to direct content creation or enforce data collection. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for aligning economic interests of different stakeholders in the online learning problems through contract design. The problem, termed \emph{contractual reinforcement learning}, naturally arises from the classic model of Markov decision processes, where a learning principal seeks to optimally influence the agent's action policy for their common interests through a set of payment rules contingent on the realization of next state. For the planning problem, we design an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to determine the optimal contracts against the far-sighted agent. For the learning problem, we introduce a generic design of no-regret learning algorithms to untangle the challenges from robust design of contracts to the balance of exploration and exploitation, reducing the complexity analysis to the construction of efficient search algorithms. For several natural classes of problems, we design tailored search algorithms that provably achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We also present an algorithm with $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for the general problem that improves the existing analysis in online contract design with mild technical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Escaping Arrow's Theorem: The Advantage-Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an extensive literature in social choice theory studying the consequences of weakening the assumptions of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Much of this literature suggests that there is no escape from Arrow-style impossibility theorems, while remaining in an ordinal preference setting, unless one drastically violates the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA). In this paper, we present a more positive outlook. We propose a model of comparing candidates in elections, which we call the Advantage-Standard (AS) model. The requirement that a collective choice rule (CCR) be representable by the AS model captures a key insight of IIA but is weaker than IIA; yet it is stronger than what is known in the literature as weak IIA (two profiles alike on $x,y$ cannot have opposite strict social preferences on $x$ and $y$). In addition to motivating violations of IIA, the AS model makes intelligible violations of another Arrovian assumption: the negative transitivity of the strict social preference relation $P$. While previous literature shows that only weakening IIA to weak IIA or only weakening negative transitivity of $P$ to acyclicity still leads to impossibility theorems, we show that jointly weakening IIA to AS representability and weakening negative transitivity of $P$ leads to no such impossibility theorems. Indeed, we show that several appealing CCRs are AS representable, including even transitive CCRs.</description>

      <title>An Axiomatic Characterization of Split Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of rules for resolving majority cycles in elections have been proposed in the literature. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit (Journal of Theoretical Politics 33 (2021) 475-524) axiomatically characterized the class of rules refined by one such cycle-resolving rule, dubbed Split Cycle: in each majority cycle, discard the majority preferences with the smallest majority margin. They showed that any rule satisfying five standard axioms plus a weakening of Arrow's Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA), called Coherent IIA, is refined by Split Cycle. In this paper, we go further and show that Split Cycle is the only rule satisfying the axioms of Holliday and Pacuit together with two additional axioms, which characterize the class of rules that refine Split Cycle: Coherent Defeat and Positive Involvement in Defeat. Coherent Defeat states that any majority preference not occurring in a cycle is retained, while Positive Involvement in Defeat is closely related to the well-known axiom of Positive Involvement (as in J. Perez, Social Choice and Welfare 18 (2001) 601-616). We characterize Split Cycle not only as a collective choice rule but also as a social choice correspondence, over both profiles of linear ballots and profiles of ballots allowing ties.</description>

      <title>Strategic Ambiguity in Global Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In games with incomplete and ambiguous information, rational behavior depends not only on fundamental ambiguity (ambiguity about states) but also on strategic ambiguity (ambiguity about others' actions), which further induces hierarchies of ambiguous beliefs. We study the impacts of strategic ambiguity in global games and demonstrate the distinct effects of ambiguous-quality and low-quality information. Ambiguous-quality information makes more players choose an action yielding a constant payoff, whereas (unambiguous) low-quality information makes more players choose an ex-ante best response to the uniform belief over the opponents' actions. If the ex-ante best-response action yields a constant payoff, sufficiently ambiguous-quality information induces a unique equilibrium, whereas sufficiently low-quality information generates multiple equilibria. In applications to financial crises, we show that news of more ambiguous quality triggers a debt rollover crisis, whereas news of less ambiguous quality triggers a currency crisis.</description>

      <title>A Robust Characterization of Nash Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize Nash equilibrium by postulating coherent behavior across varying games. Nash equilibrium is the only solution concept that satisfies the following axioms: (i) strictly dominant actions are played with positive probability, (ii) if a strategy profile is played in two games, it is also played in every convex combination of these games, and (iii) players can shift probability arbitrarily between two indistinguishable actions, and deleting one of these actions has no effect. Our theorem implies that every equilibrium refinement violates at least one of these axioms. Moreover, every solution concept that approximately satisfies these axioms returns approximate Nash equilibria, even in natural subclasses of games, such as two-player zero-sum games, potential games, and graphical games.</description>

      <title>The Value of Context: Human versus Black Box Evaluators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are now capable of performing evaluations previously conducted by human experts (e.g., medical diagnoses). How should we conceptualize the difference between evaluation by humans and by algorithms, and when should an individual prefer one over the other? We propose a framework to examine one key distinction between the two forms of evaluation: Machine learning algorithms are standardized, fixing a common set of covariates by which to assess all individuals, while human evaluators customize which covariates are acquired to each individual. Our framework defines and analyzes the advantage of this customization -- the value of context -- in environments with high-dimensional data. We show that unless the agent has precise knowledge about the joint distribution of covariates, the benefit of additional covariates generally outweighs the value of context.</description>

      <title>Absolute and Relative Ambiguity Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We represent preferences that exhibit absolute or relative attitudes towards ambiguity without assuming convexity of preferences. Our analysis is motivated by the recent experimental evidence by Baillon and Placido (2019) indicating that ambiguity becomes more tolerable as individuals are better off overall. Decreasing absolute ambiguity aversion is characterized by constant superadditive certainty equivalents and admits an act-dependent variational representation (Maccheroni et al., 2006). Decreasing relative ambiguity aversion relates to positive superhomogeneity and admits an act-dependent confidence preference representation (Chateauneuf and Faro, 2009). We apply our characterizations to retrieve a classic risk sharing result on the efficiency of trade and subjective beliefs of the individuals (Rigotti et al., 2008).</description>

      <title>Weighted Fairness Notions for Indivisible Items Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the setting of fairly allocating indivisible items when agents have different weights representing their entitlements. First, we propose a parameterized family of relaxations for weighted envy-freeness and the same for weighted proportionality; the parameters indicate whether smaller-weight or larger-weight agents should be given a higher priority. We show that each notion in these families can always be satisfied, but any two cannot necessarily be fulfilled simultaneously. We then introduce an intuitive weighted generalization of maximin share fairness and establish the optimal approximation of it that can be guaranteed. Furthermore, we characterize the implication relations between the various weighted fairness notions introduced in this and prior work, and relate them to the lower and upper quota axioms from apportionment.</description>
