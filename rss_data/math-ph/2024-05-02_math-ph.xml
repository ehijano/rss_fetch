      <title>Exact solution of the propagation of ON-OFF signals by dispersive waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of ON-OFF signals with dispersive waves is examined in this study. An integral-form exact solution for a simple ON-OFF switching event is derived, which holds for any dispersion relation. The integral can be exactly calculated for two types of dispersion relations. Further, the analysis of these solutions shows that the ON-OFF signal propagates with the group velocity and that the boundary thickness of the signal increases with time, typically at a rate proportional to the square root of time, owing to dispersion. Additionally, an approximate solution for a general dispersion relation is derived, and a for a higher-complexity ON-OFF switching pattern is constructed.</description>

      <title>Structure of Dubrovin-Zhang free energy functions and universal identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a structural theorem relating the higher genera free energy functions of the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchies to those of the trivial theory, that is, the Witten-Kontsevich free energy functions. As an important application, for any given genus $g\geq 1$, we construct a set of universal identities valid for the free energy functions of any Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy.</description>

      <title>An elliptic fibration arising from the Lagrange top and its monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is to investigate an elliptic fibration over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ arising from the Lagrange top from the viewpoint of complex algebraic geometry. The description of the discriminant locus of this elliptic fibration is given in detail. Moreover, the concrete description of the discriminant locus and the complete classification of singular fibres of the elliptic fibration are obtained according to Miranda's theory of elliptic threefolds after suitable modifications of the base and total spaces. Furthermore, the monodromy of the elliptic fibration is described.</description>

      <title>Large gap probabilities of complex and symplectic spherical ensembles with point charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $n$ eigenvalues of complex and symplectic induced spherical ensembles, which can be realised as two-dimensional determinantal and Pfaffian Coulomb gases on the Riemann sphere under the insertion of point charges. For both cases, we show that the probability that there are no eigenvalues in a spherical cap around the poles has an asymptotic behaviour as $n\to \infty$ of the form $$ \exp\Big( c_1 n^2 + c_2 n\log n + c_3 n + c_4 \sqrt n + c_5 \log n + c_6 + \mathcal{O}(n^{-\frac1{12}}) \Big) $$ and determine the coefficients explicitly. Our results provide the second example of precise (up to and including the constant term) large gap asymptotic behaviours for two-dimensional point processes, following a recent breakthrough by Charlier.</description>

      <title>Universality of the second correlation function of the deformed Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deformed complex Ginibre ensemble $H=A_0+H_0$, where $H_0$ is the complex matrix with iid Gaussian entries, and $A_0$ is some general $n\times n$ matrix (it can be random and in this case it is independent of $H_0$). Assuming rather general assumptions on $A_0$, we prove that the asymptotic local behavior of the second correlation function of the eigenvalues of such matrices in the bulk coincides with that for the pure complex Ginibre ensemble.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape from Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an almost sure bijection which constructs the directed landscape from a sequence of infinitely many independent Brownian motions. This is the analogue of the RSK correspondence in this setting. The Brownian motions arise as a marginal of the extended Busemann process for the directed landscape, and the inverse map gives an explicit and natural coupling where Brownian last passage percolation converges in probability to the directed landscape. We use this map to prove that the directed landscape on a strip can be reconstructed from the Airy line ensemble. Along the way, we describe two more new versions of RSK in the semi-discrete setting, build a general theory of sorting via Pitman operators, and construct extended Busemann processes for the directed landscape and Brownian last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Data-driven identification of stable differential operators using constrained regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying differential operators from data is essential for the mathematical modeling of complex physical and biological systems where massive datasets are available. These operators must be stable for accurate predictions for dynamics forecasting problems. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for learning sparse differential operators that are theoretically linearly stable by solving a constrained regression problem. These underlying constraints are obtained following linear stability for dynamical systems. We further extend this approach for learning nonlinear differential operators by determining linear stability constraints for linearized equations around an equilibrium point. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated for both linear and nonlinear partial differential equations such as 1-D scalar advection-diffusion equation, 1-D Burgers equation and 2-D advection equation. The results indicated that solutions to constrained regression problems with linear stability constraints provide accurate and linearly stable sparse differential operators.</description>

      <title>Beyond Schwarzschild: New Pulsating Coordinates for Spherically Symmetric Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from a general transformation for spherically symmetric metrics where g\_11=-1/g\_00, we analyze coordinates with the common property of conformal flatness at constant solid angle element. Three general possibilities arise: one where tortoise coordinate appears as the unique solution, other that includes Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates as a very specific case, but that also allows other similar transformations, and finally a new set of coordinates with very different properties than the other two. In particular, this represents any causal patch of the spherically symmetric metrics in a compactified form. We analyze some relations, taking the Schwarzschild case as prototype, but also contrasting the cosmological de-Sitter and Anti-de-Sitter solutions for the new proposed pulsating coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide transformation matrices for arbitrary Lorentz transformations of multidimensional Hermite functions in any dimension. These serve as a valuable tool for analyzing spacetime properties of MHS fields, and aid in the description of the relativistic harmonic oscillator and digital image manipulation. We also focus on finite boosts and rotations around specific axes, enabling us to identify the Lorentz Lie algebra generators. As an application and to establish a contact with the literature we construct a basis in which the two dimensional rotation operator is diagonal. We comment on the use of hypergeometric functions, the Wigner d-functions, Kravchuk polynomials, Jacobi polynomials and generalized associated Legendre functions.</description>

      <title>The Maxwell evolution equation of electromagnetic resonators: a mathematical proof with explicit derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent publication [1], the authors employ electromagnetic quasinormal-mode theory to establish an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation governing resonator dynamics. This resulting equation bears resemblance to the classical evolution equation proposed heuristically in the temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT), yet it also presents differences. One significant difference is that the driving force in the EME equation is proportional to the derivative of the incident field, whereas in the CMT evolution equation, it is proportional to the incident field itself. This unexpected finding was substantiated by a numerical test and a mathematical demonstration in [1]. The test remains undisputed in this study. However, the demonstration unfortunately relies on unjustified shortcuts. We promptly highlight these shortcuts while proposing an alternative demonstration that is direct and indisputable. The new demonstration provides a firm mathematical foundation for the EME equation and reinforces its credibility.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: non-universality in the scaling region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$-blocked) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, "logarithmic divergences" and non-universal short distance contributions in the Wiener-Hopf factors fail to factorize out completely in the re-scaled correlators. This leads to non-universality of the leading large $r$ asymptotics at the order $\frac {e^{-r}}{r^{\frac{3}{2}}}$, even when the constant terms are re-scaled to be the same.</description>

      <title>Informationally overcomplete measurements from generalized equiangular tight frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Informationally overcomplete measurements find important applications in quantum tomography and quantum state estimation. The most popular are maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases, for which trace relations between measurement operators are well known. In this paper, we introduce a more general class of informationally overcomplete POVMs that are generated by equiangular tight frames of arbitrary rank. This class provides a generalization of equiangular measurements to non-projective POVMs, which include rescaled mutually unbiased measurements and bases. We provide a method of their construction, analyze their symmetry properties, and provide examples for highly symmetric cases. In particular, we find a wide class of generalized equiangular measurements that are conical 2-designs, which allows us to derive the index of coincidence. Our results show benefits of considering a single informationally overcomplete measurement over informationally complete collections of POVMs.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and factor ordering in (1+1)-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using properties of diffusion according to a quantum heat kernel constructed as an expectation over classical heat kernels on $S^1$, we probe the non-manifold-like nature of quantized space in a model of (1+1)-dimensional quantum gravity. By computing the mean squared displacement of a diffusing particle, we find that diffusion is anomalous, behaving similarly to that on a porous substrate, network, or fractal over short distances. The walk dimension of the path for a particle diffusing in quantized space is calculated to have an infimum of 4, rising to arbitrarily large values depending on a parameter labeling the choice of factor ordering in the quantum Hamiltonian for our model and figuring in the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction used to construct the quantum heat kernel. Additionally, we derive an expansion for return probability of a diffusing particle, whose modifications from the classical power-series form depend on the factor-ordering parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two of the most influential exact results for classical one-dimensional diffusive transport are the exact results of current statistics for the symmetric simple exclusion process in the stationary state on a finite line coupled with two unequal reservoirs at the boundary and in the non-stationary state on an infinite line. We present the corresponding result for the intermediate geometry of a semi-infinite line coupled with a single reservoir. These results are obtained using the fluctuating hydrodynamics framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory and confirmed by rare event simulations using a cloning algorithm. Our exact result enables us to address the corresponding problem on an infinite line in the presence of a slow region and several related problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for matrix geometric means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix geometric means between two positive definite matrices can be defined equivalently from distinct perspectives - as solutions to certain nonlinear systems of equations, as points along geodesics in Riemannian geometry, and as solutions to certain optimisation problems. This diversity already suggests the potential for varied applications, as well as acting as a bridge between different domains. Here we devise new quantum subroutines to efficiently prepare quantum unitary operators that embed the standard matrix geometric mean and its generalisations called the weighted matrix geometric mean. This enables the construction of solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation, which is an important class of nonlinear systems of equations that appears in machine learning, optimal control, estimation, and filtering. Using these subroutines, we present a new class of quantum learning algorithms called quantum geometric mean metric learning. This has applications in efficiently finding the best distance measure and solving classification problems in the weakly supervised limit and for anomaly detection, for both classical and quantum problems. We also show how our method can be generalised to a particular p^th-order system of nonlinear equations. These quantum subroutines for matrix geometric means are also useful in other areas of quantum information. For example, we show how to use them in the estimation of geometric Renyi relative entropies and the Uhlmann fidelity by means of the Fuchs-Caves observable. In particular, our quantum algorithms for estimating the Uhlmann and Matsumoto fidelities have optimal dependence on the precision. Finally, we provide a BQP-complete problem based on matrix geometric means that can be solved by our subroutines, thus characterising their computational capability.</description>

Abstract: This article proposes a new two-parameter generalized entropy, which can be reduced to the Tsallis and the Shannon entropy for specific values of its parameters. We develop a number of information-theoretic properties of this generalized entropy and divergence, for instance, the sub-additive property, strong sub-additive property, joint convexity, and information monotonicity. This article presents an exposit investigation on the information-theoretic and information-geometric characteristics of the new generalized entropy and compare them with the properties of the Tsallis and the Shannon entropy.</description>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory, in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.</description>

      <title>Pole-skipping of gravitational waves in the backgrounds of four-dimensional massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15921</link>

Abstract: Pole-skipping is a property of gravitational waves dictated by their behaviour at horizons of black holes. It stems from the inability to unambiguously impose ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon at an infinite discrete set of Fourier modes. The phenomenon has been best understood, when such a description exists, in terms of dual holographic (AdS/CFT) correlation function that take the value of '0/0' at these special points. In this work, we investigate details of pole-skipping purely from the point of view of classical gravity in 4d massive black hole geometries with flat, spherical and hyperbolic horizons, and with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We show that pole-skipping points naturally fall into two categories: the algebraically special points and a set of pole-skipping points that is common to the even and odd channels of perturbations. Our analysis utilises and generalises (to arbitrary maximally symmetric horizon topology and cosmological constant) the 'integrable' structure of the Darboux transformations, which relate the master field equations that describe the evolution of gravitational perturbations in the two channels. Finally, we provide new insights into a number of special cases: spherical black holes, asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black branes and pole-skipping at the cosmological horizon in de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap of the symmetric inclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the symmetric inclusion process on a general finite graph. Our main result establishes universal upper and lower bounds for the spectral gap of this interacting particle system in terms of the spectral gap of the random walk on the same graph. In the regime in which the gamma-like reversible measures of the particle systems are log-concave, our bounds match, yielding a version for the symmetric inclusion process of the celebrated Aldous' spectral gap conjecture originally formulated for the interchange process. Finally, by means of duality techniques, we draw analogous conclusions for an interacting diffusion-like unbounded conservative spin system known as Brownian energy process.</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.
  From a dynamical systems viewpoint, the message of the paper is that special families of birational maps with completely periodic dynamics under iteration admit natural deformations that are aperiodic yet completely integrable.</description>
