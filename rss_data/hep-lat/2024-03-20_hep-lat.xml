      <title>The $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ twisted gradient flow strong coupling without topology freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of topology in the lattice determination of the renormalized strong coupling via the gradient flow. This is done adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions to deal with the infamous topological freezing problem that affects standard local updating algorithms. We show that, even in the presence of severe topological freezing, both algorithms yield the same strong coupling once projected onto a fixed topological sector. Moreover, we show that using a non-projected definition of the coupling leads to the same step-scaling sequence. This means that projecting the coupling onto a fixed topological sector does not affect the determination of the dynamically-generated scale of the theory $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Absence of strong CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies, beyond doubt, that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Non-zero temperature study of spin 1/2 charmed baryons using lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of spin $1/2$ charmed baryons as the temperature increases. We make use of anisotropic lattice QCD simulations with $N_f = 2 + 1$ dynamical flavours. After determining the positive and negative parity ground state masses at the lowest temperature, we investigate the effect of rising temperature using ratios of thermal lattice correlators with both so-called reconstructed correlators and with simple model correlators. This avoids difficulties associated with non-zero temperature fitting or spectral reconstruction. We find that temperature effects are prominent throughout the hadronic phase for all negative parity channels considered and for some positive parity channels. Subsequently and where possible, we determine the masses of the ground states as a function of temperature. Finally we consider the effect of chiral symmetry restoration and extract an estimate of the pseudocritical temperature from singly charmed baryonic correlators.</description>

      <title>Phases of theories with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry and the roles of center vortices and magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the phases of theories which only have a microscopic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry, starting with a topological BF theory and deforming it in accordance with microscopic symmetry. These theories have a well-defined notion of confinement. Prototypical examples are pure $SU(N)$ gauge theories and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories. Our analysis shows that the only generic phases are in $d=2$, only the confined phase; in $d=3$, both the confined phase and the topological BF phase; and in $d=4$, the confined phase, the topological BF phase, and a phase with a massless photon. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory with a deformation which, surprisingly, produces up to $(N-1)$ photons. We give an interpretation of these findings in terms of two competing pictures of confinement -- proliferation of monopoles and proliferation of center vortices -- and conclude that the proliferation of center vortices is a necessary but insufficient condition for confinement, while that of monopoles is both necessary and sufficient.</description>
