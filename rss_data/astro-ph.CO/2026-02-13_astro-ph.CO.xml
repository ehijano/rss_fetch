      <title>Time delays and stationarity in quasar light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully Bayesian framework for time delay inference and stationarity tests in quasar light curves using marginalised Gaussian processes. The model separates a deterministic, non-stationary drift (piecewise linear mean) from stationary stochastic variability (Mat\'ern and Spectral Mixture kernels), and jointly models multiple images with per-image microlensing. Bayesian evidence and parameter posteriors are obtained via nested sampling and marginalised over model choices. Applied to the quasars WFI J2033 - 4723, B 1608 + 656, and HE 0435 - 1223, we find strong evidence for non-stationarity in B 1608 + 656 and HE 0435 - 1223, while WFI J2033 - 4723 is consistent with stationarity. The stochastic component favours an Markovian exponential kernel for B 1608 + 656 and a non-Markovian Mat\'ern-$\frac32$ kernel for WFI J2033 - 4723 and HE 0435 - 1223. Multi-length-scale Spectral Mixture kernels are disfavoured. Time delays are shown to be robust to model assumptions and consistent with prior work within the error. We further identify and mitigate a likelihood pathology which biases toward large delays, providing a practical nested sampling convergence protocol.</description>

      <title>SPT-3G D1: Compton-$y$ maps using data from the SPT-3G and Planck surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) Compton-$y$ parameter maps constructed from two years (2019-2020) of observations with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) third-generation camera, SPT-3G, combined with data from the Planck satellite. Using a linear combination (LC) pipeline, we obtain a suite of reconstructions that explore different trade-offs between statistical sensitivity and suppression of astrophysical contaminants, including minimum-variance, CMB-deprojected, and CIB-deprojected $y$-maps. We validate these maps through different statistical techniques such as auto- and cross-power spectra with large-scale structure tracers as well as stacking on cluster locations. These tests are used to understand the balance between noise and astrophysical foreground residuals (such as the CIB) in combination with the recovery of the tSZ signal for different maps. For example, results from stacking at the location of clusters confirm the robustness of the recovered tSZ signal over the $\sim 1500\: {\rm deg}^2$ SPT-3G survey field used in this analysis. The high-resolution and low-noise maps produced here provide an important cosmological tool for future studies, including measurements of the Compton-$y$ map power spectrum, cross-correlations with other tracers of the large-scale structure, detailed modeling of cluster pressure profiles, and study of the thermodynamic state of the baryons in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Linear Growth of Matter Perturbations Probed by Redshift-Space Distortions in Interacting $\Lambda(t)$CDM Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of a spatially flat $\Lambda(t)$CDM cosmology, we investigate interacting dark energy (IDE) scenarios characterized by phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble expansion rate and the dark energy density. Our analysis is performed at both the background and linear perturbation levels, with particular emphasis on the evolution of dark matter density fluctuations. Cosmological constraints are derived from a joint analysis of CMB distance priors, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Pantheon+, Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD), and $H(z)$ data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC). Using the linear growth of matter perturbations, we estimate the clustering parameter $S_8$ within IDE extensions of the flat $\Lambda(t)$CDM framework. At the perturbative level, we consider interaction terms of the form $Q_{\text{I}}=\varepsilon a H\bar{\rho}_{\Lambda(t)}$ (Model I) and $Q_{\text{II}}=\varepsilon H\bar{\rho}_{\Lambda(t)}$ (Model II). From the combined dataset, we obtain the constraints $S_8 = 0.870 \pm 0.026$ for Model I and $S_8 = 0.872 \pm 0.026$ for Model II. Finally, we discuss the implications for the coupling parameter $\varepsilon$, taking into account the semi-analytical approximations and observational data employed in this study.</description>

      <title>Stone Skipping Black Holes in Ultralight Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbit of a black hole moving within an ultralight dark matter (ULDM) soliton is naively expected to decay due to dynamical friction. However, single black holes can undergo ``stone skipping'', with their orbital radius varying quasi-periodically. We show that stone skipping is induced by the dipole excitation of the soliton. We model it as resonance in a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, demonstrating that the coherent response of the soliton can significantly modify the dynamics of objects orbiting within it. This suggests that a dipole perturbation of a soliton can modify inspiral timescales if the black holes masses are significantly less than the soliton mass, with implications for supermassive black hole dynamics, the final parsec problem and gravitational wave observations in a ULDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the stochastic formalism including non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate stochastic dynamics in cosmology by solving Langevin equations for Infrared (IR) modes with stochastic noises generated by Ultraviolet (UV) modes at the coarse-graining scale. By construction, the stochastic formalism relies on the separation of scales, which requires solving the equations for UV modes on top of the evolving IR modes for all modes at every time step, leading to a non-Markovian system in general. In this paper, working on a de Sitter background, we analyze several representative models by simultaneously solving the Langevin equations for IR modes and the equations for UV modes at each time step. We demonstrate that once the effects of effective masses are treated consistently by our simulation, the flat direction in the minimal supersymmtric model (MSSM) does not saturate but instead evolves as an exactly flat direction. Furthermore, we investigate memory effects in simple two models; $V=\lambda\phi^4$ and $V=\mu\phi\chi + \lambda\phi^4$, and non-Markovian contributions can lead to quantitative differences, even in stationary configurations, when compared with Markovian approximations, particularly in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Evolution of submillimeter galaxies across cosmic-web environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution and are likely influenced by their cosmic environment. However, their rarity makes environmental trends difficult to establish. We use the FLAMINGO simulation, which simultaneously reproduces the redshift distribution and number counts of SMGs. We use the DisPerSE to identify filamentary structures at $z=4$, 3, 2, 1.5, and 1. We define inner cluster-halo, outer cluster-halo, inner filament, outer filament, and void/wall environments at each redshift considering mass evolution of cluster-halos and density evolution of filaments. For a fixed stellar-mass cut of $M_* \geq 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, the fraction of SMGs in the inner cluster-halo environment declines from $\sim30\%$ at $z=4$ to $\sim3\%$ by $z=1$, and similar trends are observed in other environments. The abundance of SMGs within a cluster-halo increases with halo mass, mirroring the increase in the total galaxy population. Consequently, the ratio of SMG halo occupation to that of all galaxies is largely insensitive to halo mass, but varies with redshift. In contrast, the ratio of the halo occupation of non-SMGs to that of all galaxies declines with halo mass and shows little redshift evolution. We show that the central and satellite SMGs form two distinct populations in inner cluster-halos. SMGs occupy the metal-rich side of the metallicity distribution, but rarely attain the highest metallicities because ongoing enrichment is limited by gas depletion. The brightest SMGs (S$_{850} &gt; 10$ mJy) are found exclusively in inner cluster-halos, highlighting a strong connection between SMG luminosity and environmental density. Our results show that SMGs dominate star formation in dense environments, contributing up to $80\%$ of the SFR in inner cluster-halos at $z=4$, but less than $50\%$ in low-density regions.</description>

      <title>Probing Dynamical Dark Energy with Late-Time Data: Evidence, Tensions, and the Limits of the $w_0w_a$CDM Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the dynamical dark-energy $w_0w_a$CDM (CPL) framework against $\Lambda$CDM using CMB anisotropies and lensing together with late-time distance probes: DESI DR2 BAO, the completed SDSS-IV BAO consensus compilation, a transverse/angular BAO compilation (BAOtr), and the Cepheid-calibrated PantheonPlus SN~Ia likelihood (PP\&amp;SH0ES). We find that CPL inferences are strongly dataset-dependent. With CMB data alone, the broad geometric degeneracy in $(H_0,\Omega_{\rm m},w_0,w_a)$ admits an extrapolation tail that can extend to $q_0&lt;-1$ (super-acceleration), whereas adding DESI DR2 BAO pulls the reconstruction toward a weakly accelerating or nearly coasting present-day Universe ($q_0\simeq 0$). In contrast, combining CMB with PP\&amp;SH0ES and BAOtr yields a conventional moderately accelerating expansion ($-1&lt;q_0\lesssim 0$) and substantially reduces the Hubble tension. Across all combinations, $w(z\to\infty)=w_0+w_a&lt;-1$, while at post-recombination redshifts the expansion remains matter dominated ($q\to1/2$). The origin of this behavior can be traced to low-redshift distance information: BAOtr and DESI prefer different BAO distance ratios at $z\lesssim 0.5$, which propagates into divergent expansion histories in CPL. In all cases, $r_{\rm d}$ stays nearly unchanged, indicating that shifts in $H_0$ arise from late-time expansion freedom rather than early-Universe physics. Bayesian evidence mirrors this contingency: it is strong for CPL mainly when PP\&amp;SH0ES and/or BAOtr are included, while it is inconclusive for CMB-only and CMB+DESI and moderately favors $\Lambda$CDM for CMB+SDSS. Overall, our results show that the apparent support for CPL and its ability to ease the Hubble tension are not universal but depend sensitively on the adopted low-redshift distance data, motivating either more flexible late-time models or closer scrutiny of residual systematics in current BAO determinations.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Cosmological Mass Calibration of XXL Galaxy Clusters using HSC Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of the X-ray-selected galaxy cluster sample from the XXL survey, employing a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework to jointly constrain cosmological parameters and X-ray scaling relations through forward modeling of cluster counts, X-ray observables, and weak-lensing measurements. Our analysis combines X-ray data from the XMM-XXL survey with shear measurements from the three-year shape catalog of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. The analysis focuses on the XXL C1 sample, comprising 171 clusters for abundance modeling, a subset of 86 clusters located within the XXL-N region for lensing-based mass calibration, and 162 clusters with X-ray temperature and luminosity measurements used to constrain scaling relations. Using the density-estimation likelihood-free inference (DELFI) algorithm, we construct a forward model with 12 parameters that incorporates the XXL selection function and cluster population modeling and accounts for key systematic effects including cluster miscentering, photometric redshift bias, and mass-dependent weak-lensing bias. Our SBI analysis yields a constraint on the cosmological parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_{m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.867 \pm 0.063$, with an additional 3% systematic uncertainty from neural network stochasticity. The result is consistent with Planck and recent cluster-based measurements. The inferred temperature-mass relation is consistent with self-similar expectations within uncertainties, whereas the luminosity-temperature relation exhibits a slope steeper than the self-similar prediction. From the resulting posterior distribution of the forward model, we derive lensing-calibrated mass estimates for all individual XXL clusters with measured X-ray temperatures or luminosities. These results provide a self-consistent mass calibration for future multi-probe cosmological analyses of the XXL sample.</description>

      <title>Is cosmic birefringence due to dark energy or dark matter? Simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a powerful inference technique for cases where the exact functional form of the likelihood is not known. A prime example is the likelihood of cross-correlation power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fields at low multipoles, $\ell\lesssim 10$. In this paper, we investigate a parity-violating cross-correlation between $E$- and $B$- mode polarization fields using SBI. The $EB$ correlation at low $\ell$ is essential to distinguish between possible axion dark energy and dark matter interpretations of `cosmic birefringence', a rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the CMB, recently reported from WMAP, Planck, and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data. We use neural likelihood estimation to infer the likelihood of the $EB$ correlation at low $\ell$ and show that it is highly non-Gaussian. We then employ neural posterior estimation to constrain the scalar field mass ($m_\phi$), the cosmic birefringence amplitude ($g\phi_\mathrm{in}/2$), and the instrumental miscalibration angle ($\alpha$), from simulated datasets. We find that the posterior on $m_{\phi}$ shows two regimes, with a transition marked by $10^{-32}$ eV, highlighting a strong sensitivity to the scale dependence of cosmic birefringence. To quantify this behavior, we compute the probability $p(m_{\phi} &lt; 10^{-32}$\,eV) for various fiducial values of $m_{\phi}$. We find that $\alpha$ and the contribution of lensed $B$ modes ultimately limit our ability to exclude the dark energy scenario fully.</description>

      <title>Probing baryonic feedback with fast radio bursts: joint analyses with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological inference from weak lensing (WL) surveys is increasingly limited by uncertainties in baryonic physics, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on small scales. Multi-probe analyses that incorporate complementary tracers of the gas distribution around haloes offer a pathway to calibrate these effects and recover unbiased cosmological information. In this work, we forecast the constraining power of a joint analysis combining fiducial data from a Stage-IV WL survey with measurements of the dispersion measure from fast radio bursts (FRBs). We evaluate the ability of this approach to simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the astrophysical processes governing baryonic feedback, and we quantify the impact of key FRB systematics, including redshift uncertainties and source clustering. We find that, even after accounting for these effects, a 3$\times$2-point analysis of WL and FRBs significantly improves cosmological constraints, reducing the degradation factor on $S_8$ by $\sim 80\%$ compared to WL alone. We further show that FRBs alone are sensitive only to a degenerate combination of the key baryonic parameters, $\log_{10} M_{\rm c}$ and $\eta_{\rm b}$, and that the inclusion of WL measurements breaks this degeneracy. Finally, we extend our framework to incorporate galaxy clustering measurements using Luminous Red Galaxy and Emission Line Galaxy samples, performing a unified 6$\times$2-point analysis of WL, dispersion measures of FRBs, and galaxy clustering. While this combined approach tightens constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\log_{10} M_{\rm c}$, it does not lead to a significant improvement in $S_8$ constraints beyond those obtained from WL and FRBs alone.</description>

      <title>Extending the Cosmological Collider: New Scaling Regimes and Constraints from BOSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianity generated by additional fields during inflation offers a compelling observational target. Heavy fields imprint characteristic oscillatory signals in non-Gaussian correlation functions of the inflaton, a process sometimes referred to as cosmological-collider physics. These distinct signatures are compelling windows into ultra-high-energy physics, but are often suppressed, making standard equilateral non-Gaussianity the most promising discovery channel in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that direct couplings between the inflaton and additional fields can lead to a wide variety of novel, observationally relevant signals which open new parameter regimes that simultaneously exhibit the characteristics of light and heavy fields. We identify these primordial signatures in the late-time observables of the large-scale structure of the Universe, where they most significantly modify the scale-dependent bias of the galaxy power spectrum to include an oscillatory modulation around a non-trivial power law. We explore the full range of parameters that phenomenologically arise in these models and study the sensitivity of current and future galaxy surveys, finding that this new class of primordial non-Gaussianity is particularly accessible in near-term surveys due to its oscillatory feature. Finally, we perform an analysis of existing data from the final release of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR12). While we find no evidence for a signal, we demonstrate significant improvements in sensitivity over respective non-oscillatory scenarios and place the first constraints on this extended parameter space of oscillatory non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Status of the $S_8$ Tension: A 2026 Review of Probe Discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ quantifies the amplitude of matter density fluctuations. A persistent discrepancy exists between early-universe CMB observations and late-universe probes. This review assesses the ``$S_8$ tension'' against a new 2026 baseline: a unified ``Combined CMB'' framework incorporating Planck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G. This combined analysis yields $S_8 = 0.836^{+0.012}_{-0.013}$, providing a higher central value and reduced uncertainties compared to Planck alone. Compiling measurements from 2019--2026, we reveal a striking bifurcation: DES Year 6 results exhibit a statistically significant tension of $2.4\sigma$--$2.7\sigma$ \citep{DESY6}, whereas KiDS Legacy results demonstrate statistical consistency at $&lt;1\sigma$ \citep{Wright2025}. We examine systematic origins of this dichotomy, including photometric redshift calibration, intrinsic alignment modeling, and shear measurement pipelines. We further contextualize these findings with cluster counts (where eROSITA favors high values while SPT favors low), galaxy-galaxy lensing, and redshift-space distortions. The heterogeneous landscape suggests survey-specific systematic effects contribute substantially to observed discrepancies, though new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM cannot be excluded.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of the Moon: Listening to Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collapse of large-amplitude primordial curvature perturbations into planetary-mass primordial black holes generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave background in the $\mu $Hz frequency range that may be detectable by future Lunar Laser Ranging and Satellite Laser Ranging data. We derive projected constraints on the primordial black hole population from a null detection of stochastic gravitational wave background by these experiments, including the impact of the electroweak phase transition on the abundance of planetary-mass primordial black holes. We also discuss the connection between the obtained projected constraints and the recent microlensing observations by the HSC collaboration of the Andromeda Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Reionization Bubbles from Real-Space Cross Correlations of Line Intensity Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new way to reconstruct the ionized-bubble size distribution during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) through the real-space cross-correlation of 21-cm and star-forming line-intensity maps. Understanding the evolution and timing of the EoR is crucial for both astrophysics and cosmology, and a wealth of information on the first sources can be extracted from the study of ionized bubbles. Nevertheless, directly mapping bubbles is challenging due to the high redshifts involved, possible selection biases, and foregrounds in 21-cm maps. Here, we exploit the real-space cross-correlation $\xi_{21,\nu}$ between 21-cm and line-intensity mapping (LIM) signals to reconstruct the evolution of bubble sizes during reionization. For the first time, we show that $\xi_{21,\nu}(r)$ departs from a saturation level for each separation $r$ when bubbles of size $r$ begin to form, providing a handle for the onset of bubbles of each radius. Moreover, we demonstrate that $\xi_{21,\nu}$ evolves from positive to negative as the EoR progresses, reaching a minimum (i.e. maximum anti-correlation) when bubbles of radius $r$ reach peak abundance. We show that these results are robust to changes in the astrophysical model as well as the timing/topology of reionization. This real-space observable complements usual Fourier-space estimators by capturing the localized nature of bubbles, offering new insights into the sources driving cosmic reionization.</description>

      <title>Sterile neutrino dark matter in conformal Majoron models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) in a classically conformal U(1)' extension of the Standard Model with three right-handed neutrinos and a Majoron-like singlet scalar that generate the observed pattern of active neutrino masses and mixing via the type-I seesaw mechanism. Working in the regime of strongly suppressed active-sterile mixing, we show that the observed DM abundance can be produced through freeze-in from feeble interactions mediated by the heavy Z' and the conformal scalar. We solve the Boltzmann equation for the nonthermal phase-space distribution and confront the scenario with Lyman-$\alpha$ data by computing the matter power spectrum. For keV-scale sterile neutrinos we identify the viable parameter space consistent with structure-formation and X-ray bounds, including regions compatible with a tentative 3.5 keV line. If a second sterile state is long-lived, late decays can realize a two-component setup that alleviates the $S_8$ tension. In a highly fine-tuned variant of the model, the 220 PeV KM3NeT event can also be explained by invoking the decay of a superheavy sterile neutrino.</description>

      <title>Tango of Titans: Centaurus A and M83 as a Local Group Analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 form one of the most massive galaxy pairs in the nearby Universe. Although their observed heliocentric velocities suggest motion that is not obviously indicative of mutual attraction, this work presents evidence that CenA and M83 are in fact infalling toward each other, exhibiting a dynamical interaction analogous to the binary-like motion of the Milky Way and Andromeda in the Local Group (LG). Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter. This yields a total mass of $(6.36 \pm 1.30) \cdot 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. The inferred mass agrees well with independent estimates based on virial mass measurements and $K$-band luminosity--to-mass ratios. Together, the consistent bound signature and robust mass determination highlight the CenA/M83 system as a compelling nearby analog to the LG. Further discussion of NGC 4945 as a main perturber (as the Large Magellanic Could) for the CenA is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Quasar Proximity Effect as an Alternative Probe of Quasar Pair Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered quasar pairs at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim$5) are likely precursors to supermassive black hole mergers, providing a promising window to high redshift quasar growth mechanisms. However, the large uncertainties on their relative distances along the line-of-sight ($d_{\rm l.o.s.}$) limits our ability to characterize quasar pairs. In this study, we explore synthetic quasar proximity zone spectra as an alternative method to constrain the line-of-sight distance of quasar pairs. We find that for small sky-plane separations ($d_{\rm sky}\approx 10-100$ pkpc), a simple peak finding algorithm can easily distinguish between scenarios of $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \lesssim1$ pMpc and $\gtrsim1$ pMpc. For cases where the true $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \geq 3$ pMpc, the accuracy of $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimation is $\approx 0.2$ pMpc. Large sky-plane separations of $d_{\rm sky}=1$ pMpc have larger absolute uncertainties in $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimates, but the method can still easily distinguish between scenarios where $d_{\rm l.o.s.}\lesssim4$ pMpc and $\gtrsim4$ pMpc. $d_{\rm l.o.s.}$ estimates have an uncertainty of $\approx$0.5 pMpc when true $d_{\rm l.o.s.} \gtrsim4$ pMpc. Our proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential use of quasar proximity zones to constrain the 3-dimensional quasar pair configuration, providing an avenue to characterize quasar pairs.</description>

      <title>Tailored mass estimators for Milky Way dwarf Spheroidals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium within a given gravitational potential, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globally averaged stellar velocity dispersion depends entirely on the shape of its stellar density profile. Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.</description>

      <title>Measurement prospects for the pair-instability mass cutoff with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\gtrsim20\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\,\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\gtrsim125\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{b}$ at $90\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.</description>

      <title>GR from RG: Gravity Is Induced From Renormalization Group Flow In The Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this essay and utilizing the holographic Renormalization Group (RG) flow, we demonstrate how the effective action of a non-gravitating quantum field theory in the ultraviolet (UV) develops an Einstein-Hilbert term in the infrared (IR). That is, gravity is induced by the RG flow. An inherent outcome of holography that plays a crucial role in our analysis is the \textit{RG flow of boundary conditions}: the rigid Dirichlet conditions on the background metric in the UV become an admixture of Dirichlet and Neumann as we flow to the IR, thereby ``unfreezing'' the metric and transforming it from a non-dynamical background into a dynamical field. This mechanism, which is a conceptually new addition to the standard Wilsonian RG flow, also provides the mechanism to evade the Weinberg-Witten no-go theorem. Within the GR from RG picture outlined here, the search for a quantum theory of gravity by treating the metric as a fundamental field may be a hunt for a phantom -- akin to seeking the atomic structure of water by quantizing the equations of hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic Connection Between Cosmological And Planck Scales: The Barrow-Tsallis Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges of quantum gravity is to understand how the microscopic degrees of freedom of the cosmological horizon shape the evolution of the Universe. One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact. Therefore, the uncertainty in the relationship between the model parameters depends only on the current uncertainty in the values of the cosmographic parameters.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Fuzzy Cosmic-Web for Field Level Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of the cosmological large-scale structure derived from galaxy surveys involves field-level inference, which requires a forward modelling framework that simultaneously accounts for structure formation and tracer bias. While structure formation models are well-understood, the development of an effective field-level bias model remains challenging within Bayesian reconstruction methods, which we address in this work. To bridge this gap, we have developed a differentiable model that integrates augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory, nonlinear, nonlocal, and stochastic biasing. At the core of our approach is the HICOBIAN model, which provides a description of a field with a positive number of tracers while incorporating a long- and short-range nonlocal framework and deviations from Poissonity in the likelihood. A key insight of our model is that transitions between cosmic-web regions are inherently smooth, which we implement using sigmoid-based gradient operations. This enables a fuzzy, and, hence, differentiable hierarchical cosmic-web description, making the model well-suited for machine learning frameworks. We test the practical implementation of this model through GPU-accelerated computations implemented in JaX, the BRIDGE code, enabling scalable evaluation of complex biasing. Our approach accurately reproduces the primordial density field within associated error bars derived from Bayesian posterior sampling within a self-specified setting as validated by two- and three-point statistics in Fourier space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the methodology approaches the maximum encoded information consistent with Poisson noise. We also demonstrate that the bias parameters of a higher-order nonlocal bias model can be accurately reconstructed within the Bayesian framework for bias models with eight parameters.</description>

      <title>How the cosmic voids contribute to stalling and quenching the giant galaxies on their surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a numerical hint that the formations of cosmic voids may be closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower specific star formation rates (sSFR). Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder algorithm~\cite{HV02} at $z=0$, $0.5$ and $1$, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge 10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found at all of the three redshifts that the perpendicular alignments of void-surface galaxies become stronger for the cases that they have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR, but showing weak dependence on the stellar ages. It is also shown that the numerical results are well described by the analytical one-parameter model developed by Lee~\cite{lee19} under the assumption of the existence of a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local tidal tensors. We test the robustness of alignment signals against the variation of void-finder algorithms and its feasibility against the redshift-space and projection effects. Our results lead us to speculate that the formation and expansion of voids may have an effect of stalling and quenching the giant void-surface galaxies by compressing adjacent matter and then preventing them from radial infall/accretion.</description>

      <title>Galaxy assembly bias in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: a comparison between SIMBA and IllustrisTNG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling of large-scale structure is increasingly concerned with galaxy assembly bias (GAB), the dependence of galaxy clustering on quantities other than halo mass. We investigate how baryonic physics affects the strength and redshift evolution of GAB using the largest runs of two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We quantify GAB by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass-selected galaxies to that of shuffled samples, where galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of similar mass. We find that GAB in both simulations increases from approximately zero at $z=5$ to a $\sim\,5\%$ change in clustering amplitude at $z=2$. After this epoch, the trends diverge: GAB in TNG continues to increase, reaching $\sim\,10\%$ at $z=0$, while in SIMBA it decreases to nearly zero. By further shuffling galaxies within bins of halo mass and cosmic environment -- characterised by smoothed matter overdensity ($\delta_5$) and tidal anisotropy ($\alpha_5$) -- we show that most of the GAB in both simulations can be attributed to the overdensity, while tidal anisotropy contributes negligibly in both simulations. Exploring this effect from the point of view of the halo occupation distribution (HOD), we find that numbers of central and satellite galaxies vary with overdensity -- but only near the respective turn-on masses for these two constituents: the galaxy contents of high-mass haloes are very nearly independent of environment. We present a simple parameterisation that allows the HOD modelling to be modified to reflect this form of density-dependent GAB.</description>

      <title>Revisiting model-independent constraints on spatial curvature and cosmic ladders calibration: updated and forecast analyses</title>

Abstract: Model-independent approaches have gained increasing attention as powerful tools to investigate persistent tensions between cosmological observations and the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM. Notably, recent DESY5 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data challenge the validity of the cosmological constant, and they remain in tension with SH0ES local distance ladder measurements under standard pre-recombination physics. Building on our previous work, MNRAS 523 (2023) 3, 3406-3422, we present a follow-up analysis of the model-independent calibration of the local and inverse distance ladders using cosmic chronometers (CCH) data and Gaussian Processes. We jointly constrain the SNIa absolute magnitude, $M$, the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, $r_d$, and the spatial curvature parameter, $\Omega_k$, using CCH with DESY5 and DESI DR1/DR2. We find this data combination compatible with a flat universe at $\sim1.7\sigma$, with $\Omega_k=-0.143\pm0.085$, showing weaker compatibility than with Pantheon+, while the ladder calibrators read $M=-19.324_{-0.095}^{+0.092}$ and $r_d=(144.00^{+5.38}_{-4.88}$) Mpc. Although current uncertainties limit the precision of our constraints and prevent us from arbitrating the Hubble tension, it is nevertheless instructive to explore the constraining power of our methodology with future SNIa, CCH, and BAO from surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and DESI. We present the first forecast analysis for the triad $(M,\Omega_k,r_d)$, finding that, in an optimistic scenario, upcoming data will improve agnostic constraints on $M$ by $\sim$54% and on $r_d$ by $\sim$66%, enabling a $\sim2$% determination of $H_0$. Precision on $\Omega_k$ will increase by $\sim50$%. Our analysis outlines which improvements in future data - whether in quality, quantity, or redshift coverage - are likely to most effectively tighten these constraints.[abridged]</description>

      <title>Kinematic Reconstruction of $\Lambda(t)$CDM Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have \textbf{analysed} two kinematic parametrizations for $\Lambda(t)$CDM models, namely, the linear expansions $\Lambda(z)=\Lambda_0+\Lambda_1z$ and $Q(z)=Q_0+Q_1z$, where $Q$ is the interaction term. In the case of the $Q(z)$ parametrization, we have also tested the particular case of a constant interaction term, $Q(z)=Q_0$. In order to constrain the free parameters of these models, we have used Cosmic Chronometers (CC), SNe Ia data (Pantheon+\&amp;SH0ES) and BAO data. As a general result, we have found weak constraints over the free parameters of the analysed models. In the case of $\Lambda(z)$, we have found for the $\Lambda$ variation parameter, $\Omega_{\Lambda1}\equiv\frac{\Lambda_1}{3H_0^2}=0.02\pm0.14$. In the case of the $Q(z)$ parametrization, we have worked with the dimensionless interaction term $\gQ(z)\equiv\frac{8\pi GQ(z)}{3H_0^3}$, from which we have found $\gQ_0 = 2.2 \pm 2.7$ and $\gQ_1 = -6.2 \pm 7.6$. In the particular case of a constant interaction term, we have found $\gQ_0 = 0.18 \pm 0.7$. All these constraints are at 68\% c.l. The constraints we have obtained are compatible with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, although still providing a large margin for $\Lambda$ variation.</description>

      <title>Structural Limitations on Constraining the Time Evolution of Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on a time-varying dark energy equation of state are fundamentally limited by the integral structure through which the equation of state enters cosmological observables. We rigorously derive the linear response kernel that maps perturbations in the equation of state \omega(z) to comoving distance fluctuations \delta D(z). By adopting a Fourier mode expansion \delta \omega(z) = \sin(kz), we obtain the exact analytic form of the distance response in terms of Sine and Cosine integrals. We show that this mapping involves a double integration over redshift, which acts as an intrinsic low-pass filter with a characteristic \sim k^{-2} scaling in redshift space. This structural limitation is visualized in a schematic diagram and confirmed by observational verification using the full covariance matrix of the Pantheon+ supernova dataset. Our analysis reveals a steep hierarchy in Fisher eigenvalues where the information content drops by an order of magnitude already at the second eigenmode. Consequently, distance-based probes effectively constrain only a single dominant mode of \omega(z). This implies that the difficulty in constraining dynamical parameters such as w_a is not due to data precision, but is a necessary consequence of the observable's integral nature, which renders it structurally blind to the instantaneous rate of change d\omega/da.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave oscillations in Multi-Proca dark energy models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave oscillations arise from the exchange of energy between the metric perturbations and additional tensor modes. This phenomenon can occur even when the extra degrees of freedom consist of a triplet of massive Abelian vector fields, as in Multi-Proca dark energy models. In this work, we study gravitational wave oscillations in this class of models minimally coupled to gravity with a general potential, allowing also for a kinetic coupling between the vector field and dark matter that can, in principle, enhance the modulation of gravitational wave amplitudes. After consistently solving the background dynamics, requiring the model parameters to reproduce a phase of late-time accelerated expansion, we assess the accuracy of commonly used analytical approximations and quantify the impact of gravitational wave amplitude modulation for current detectors (LIGO--Virgo) and future missions such as LISA. Although oscillations are present in these scenarios, we find that the effective mass scale (the mixing mass) governing the phenomenon is $m_g \sim \mu_A$, where $\mu_A$ is the (time-dependent) effective mass of the vector dark-energy field. Detectability of gravitational wave oscillations, however, requires $m_g \gg H_0$, which is in tension with the ultra-light masses typically needed to drive accelerated expansion $\mu_A \sim H_0 \sim 10^{-33}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, if gravitational wave oscillations were to be detected at the corresponding frequencies, they could not be attributed to these classes of dark-energy models.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on Cosmology and Modified Gravitational-wave Propagation by Strongly Lensed Gravitational Waves Associating with Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational wave (GW) will become the next frontier in studying cosmology and gravity. While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\%$, $10\%$ and $0.42\%$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$. In addition, our method can provide precise constraints on modified GW propagation effects jointly with $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w &lt; -1$). This finding challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $\xi \chi^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 &gt; -1, w_a &lt; 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2\xi$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.</description>

      <title>Non-Commutative fluid: an alternative source of cosmic acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel formulation for the Hubble parameter derived from Newtonian cosmology, incorporating non-commutative fluid dynamics through a deformed Poisson bracket structure. This approach introduces a new cosmological parameter, denoted by $\sigma$, which emerges naturally from the underlying non-commutative framework. It gives rise to a source term in the background fluid continuity equation, thereby leading to an apparent type of matter creation picture through the resulting non-conservation. Remarkably, the resulting Hubble function accounts for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe without invoking any external dark energy component or cosmological constant. Instead, the parameter $\sigma$ effectively serves as the driver of acceleration. We further examine the observational constraints on $\sigma$ using current cosmological data, including the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI) dataset, demonstrating its viability as an alternative explanation for late-time cosmic acceleration within a non-commutative cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in and freeze-out production of Higgs portal Majorana fermionic dark matter during and after reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of Majorana fermionic dark matter (DM) via the Higgs portal, considering both freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms during and after the post-inflationary reheating phase. We assume that the Universe is reheated through the decay of the inflaton ($\phi$) into a pair of fermions $f$ and $\bar f$ via the interaction $y\,\phi\,\bar f\,f$, where $y$ is the dimensionless Yukawa coupling. Our analysis focuses on how the non-standard evolution of the Hubble expansion rate and the thermal bath temperature during reheating influence DM production. Additionally, we examine the impact of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), distinguishing between scenarios where DM freeze-in or freeze-out occurs before or after EWSB. We further explore the viable DM parameter space and its compatibility with current and future detection experiments, including XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XLZD, and collider searches. Moreover, we incorporate constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ bound to ensure consistency with small-scale structure formation.</description>

Abstract: First-order phase transitions (FOPT) are ubiquitous in beyond the Standard Model physics and leave distinctive echoes in the history of early universe. We consider a FOPT serving the well-motivated role of dark matter mass generation and present {\it blast-frozen dark matter} (BFDM), which transitions from radiation to non-relativistic relic in a period much shorter than the corresponding Hubble time. Its cosmological imprint are strong oscillations in the dark matter density perturbations that seed structure formation on large and small scales. For a FOPT occurring not long before the matter-radiation equality, next generation cosmological surveys bear a strong potential to discover BFDM and in turn establish the origin of dark matter mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20071v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may exist today and be candidates for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via the Hawking radiation of PBHs, and PBHs that survived Hawking evaporation via the memory burden effect. Feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are alternatives to WIMPs. Focusing on parameter regions where thermal production dominates and PBHs never dominate the energy density of the Universe, we identify a sufficient condition under which DM particles emitted from PBHs do not thermalize with the thermal bath. In this regime, the total DM relic abundance can be consistently obtained as the sum of the three components. In addition, we show that the contribution from gravitational freeze-in via graviton exchange remains subdominant within the parameter space considered.</description>

Abstract: Holography and entropy bounds suggest that the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) cutoffs of gravitational effective theories are related to one another as a form of UV/IR mixing. Motivated by this, we derive a bound on the allowed scalar field range in theories with cosmic horizons. We show how this bound challenges several inflationary scenarios, such as $\alpha$-attractors and modular-invariant inflation. Besides, we find a relation between the number of extra spatial dimensions and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the framework of spatially covariant gravity (SCG), a broad class of Lorentz-violating modified gravity theories respecting only spatial diffeomorphism invariance. Extending earlier SCG formulations, we compute the general kernel function for SIGWs on a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background, focusing on polynomial-type SCG Lagrangians up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the total number of derivatives in each monomial. We derive explicit expressions for the kernel in the case of power-law time evolution of the coefficients, and restrict attention to the subset of SCG operators whose tensor modes propagate at the speed of light, thereby avoiding late-time divergences in the fractional energy density of SIGWs. Instead of the usual Newtonian gauge, the breaking of time reparametrization symmetry in SCG necessitates a unitary gauge analysis. We compute the energy density of SIGWs for representative parameter combinations, finding distinctive deviations from general relativity (GR), including scale-dependent modifications to both the amplitude and the spectral shape. Our results highlight the potential of stochastic GW background measurements to probe spatially covariant gravity and other Lorentz-violating extensions of GR.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical modeling of gravitational-wave populations for disentangling environmental and modified-gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect up to thousands of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). These sources will spend $\sim 10^5$ cycles in band, and are therefore sensitive to tiny changes in the general-relativistic dynamics, potentially induced by astrophysical environments or modifications of general relativity (GR). Previous studies have shown that these effects can be highly degenerate for a single source. However, it may be possible to distinguish between them at the population level, because environmental effects should impact only a fraction of the sources, while modifications of GR would affect all. We therefore introduce a population-based hierarchical framework to disentangle the two hypotheses. Using simulated EMRI populations, we perform tests of the null vacuum-GR hypothesis and two alternative beyond-vacuum-GR hypotheses, namely migration torques (environmental effects) and time-varying $G$ (modified gravity). We find that with as few as $\approx 20$ detected sources, our framework can statistically distinguish between these three hypotheses, and even indicate if both environmental and modified gravity effects are simultaneously present in the population. Our framework can be applied to other models of beyond-vacuum-GR effects available in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The presence of multiple light axions in the infrared is a generic feature of many ultraviolet (UV) scenarios. In many cases the number of axions ${\cal N}$ is ${\cal O}(10-100)$ or more. Even in the scenario where these axions interact very weakly with the Standard Model (SM), the presence of ${\cal N}$ light axions poses a challenge to the stringent constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$. In order to remain agnostic about the UV, we adopt an effective field theory (EFT) approach, and parametrize the interactions of ${\cal N}$ axions with the SM to quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$. We consider operators up to dimension six, uncovering one previously-unconsidered charge radius operator, and pay particular attention to the flavor structure of the axion-SM fermion couplings and consider EFTs based on anarchy, textures, and minimal flavor violation. For various choices of such EFTs, we identify the discovery space for current and future cosmic microwave background surveys, including the Simons Observatory and CMB-HD. We show this discovery space depends sensitively on the flavor structure and exhibits a rich interplay with terrestrial and astrophysical probes.</description>

      <title>Axions on a Hyperbolic Ride: Geometric Suppression of CMB Isocurvature and a Blue-Tilted Spectrum</title>

Abstract: CMB limits on cold-dark-matter isocurvature are often interpreted as excluding the simultaneous realization of high-scale inflation and large QCD axion decay constants in pre-inflationary Peccei--Quinn (PQ) scenarios. We show that this conclusion can be evaded by exploiting \emph{field-space geometry}. For a minimal complex PQ scalar with a $U(1)$-symmetric potential and a nonlinear sigma-model kinetic term $d\sigma^{2}=dR^{2}+f^{2}(R)\,d\theta^{2}$, the observable axion fluctuation is $\delta\theta\sim H_{\rm inf}/f(R)$, so an enhanced effective decay constant $f(R)$ suppresses isocurvature without explicit PQ breaking, extreme radial displacements, or additional couplings. Specializing to a hyperbolic metric $f(R)\propto \sinh(R/L)$ with curvature scale $L$, we find that for $R\gtrsim L$ the exponential geometric-factor $f(R)$ strongly suppresses CMB-scale isocurvature while producing a characteristic blue-tilted spectrum. The same geometry induces a time-dependent $\mathcal{O}(H_{\rm inf})$ effective mass for the canonical axial mode even during radial slow-roll, which controls the scale-dependence of isocurvature. As a result, inflationary Hubble scales as large as $H_{\rm inf}\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ can be compatible with $f_a\sim 10^{14}$--$10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, reopening parameter space usually regarded as excluded. We present numerical benchmarks and a semi-analytic template that relates the scale-dependence of isocurvature to the geometric lever arm $R/L$, providing a direct phenomenological probe on PQ field-space geometry.</description>
