      <title>Unveiling the shape of the $^{20}$Ne nucleus by measuring the flow coefficients with cumulants in PbNe and PbAr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 70.9$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ quantify the collective medium response to the initial spatial anisotropy of the overlapping region in ion collisions and serve as sensitive probes of both the medium properties and shape of nuclear initial states. In this analysis, the $v_2$ and $v_3$ parameters of prompt charged particles are measured using the multiparticle cumulant method in fixed-target PbNe and PbAr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 70.9$ GeV, collected by LHCb using the SMOG2 gas-target system during the 2024 LHC lead-beam run. The cumulant method is first validated using 2018 PbPb collision data, successfully reproducing previous measurements obtained via the two-particle correlation method. Results for the fixed-target collisions are then presented, showing a significantly larger value of the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$ in central PbNe with respect to PbAr collisions. This is qualitatively consistent with 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions including ab-initio descriptions of the nuclear structure. The results provide the first experimental confirmation of the distinctive bowling-pin shape of the ground-state $^{20}$Ne nucleus, validating at the same time the hydrodynamic description of the hot medium formed in high-energy collisions involving light ions.</description>

      <title>Observation of charmonium sequential suppression in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of charmonium sequential suppression in $^{96}_{44}\rm{Ru}$+$^{96}_{44}\rm{Ru}$ and $^{96}_{40}\rm{Zr}$+$^{96}_{40}\rm{Zr}$ collisions at \sqrtsnn\ = 200 GeV with the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The inclusive yield ratio of $\psi$(2S) to J/$\psi$ as a function of transverse momentum is reported, along with the centrality dependence of the double ratio, defined as the $\psi$(2S) to J/$\psi$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions relative to that in $p$+$p$ collisions. In the 0-80\% centrality class, the double ratio is found to be 0.41 $\pm$ 0.10 (stat) $\pm$ 0.03 (syst) $\pm$ 0.02 (ref), lower than unity with a significance of 5.6 standard deviations. This provides experimental evidence that $\psi$(2S) is significantly more suppressed than J/$\psi$ in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. It is also observed that this sequential suppression pattern is more pronounced at lower transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant capture cross section measurement of the 29Si(p,gamma)30P reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isotopic ratios measured in meteoritic presolar grains are a crucial tool for tracing the nucleosynthetic origin of isotopes. In the case of silicon isotopes, two important indicators to establish the origin of presolar grains are the ratios 29Si/28Si and 30Si/28Si. To constrain theoretical predictions, the rates of key nuclear reactions influencing the abundances of 29Si and 30Si must be well known. One such reaction is 29Si(p,gamma)30P which plays a role in classical nova explosions. The aim of the present work is to determine the nonresonant cross section of the 29Si(p,gamma)30P reaction, which has not been previously measured. The activation method was employed to measure the total cross section at four proton energies between Ep = 1000 and 1430 keV. The measured cross sections were found to be significantly (a factor of 4.3+-0.6) higher than those predicted by theoretical direct capture calculations, thereby impacting the reaction rates at low astrophysical temperatures, below about 30 MK. This higher nonresonant cross section - now based on experimental data - can be used in forthcoming nucleosynthesis calculations of classical novae. As a secondary result, the 16O(p,gamma)17F cross section was also obtained and found to be in good agreement with existing literature data.</description>

      <title>Measurement of neutron total cross-section of Mg and MgF$_{2}$ at MONNET (JRC-Geel) from transmission with fine multi-scattering corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron-transmission measurements through samples of magnesium fluoride (MgF$_2$) and pure magnesium were performed to obtain the (n, tot) cross section for all isotopes involved, $^{19}$F and $^{24-26}$Mg. Lithium-glass detectors were used in conjunction with the neutron time-of-flight technique. The measurement campaign was performed at the MONNET fast-neutron source of the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC-Geel, Belgium). Highly precise corrections for multiple scattering were calculated using a sophisticated iterative method based on Monte Carlo simulations with the MCNP6.3 code, accounting for the effects of the experimental setup. With the SAMMY code, an R-Matrix analysis of the experimental data was performed. The extracted cross-sections, resonance spin and parity as well as the limitations of the method are carefully discussed.</description>

      <title>Search for Quintessence-Like Pseudoscalar Dark Energy Effects on $^{56}\text{Fe}$ Nuclear Transition Energies in Supernova 1991T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy remains one of the most important unanswered problems in physics. Here we use gamma-ray spectra from the Type Ia supernova 1991T to constrain the recent evolution of a dynamical pseudoscalar quintessence-like field $Q(t)$. We found that the 1991T gamma rays emitted by the $^{56}\text{Fe}$ nuclei observed by COMPTEL aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory were slightly shifted to lower energies with respect to terrestrial values, with the average fractional energy shift of both the first and second excited states found to be $\delta E/E = -0.006\pm0.008$ including statistical and systematic errors. Assuming that this energy shift is caused by a dynamical QCD axion-like pseudoscalar field $Q(t)$, we find that observed energy deviations are consistent with a fractional rate of change of the pion mass given by $\delta \dot{m_{\pi}}/m_{\pi}=-(6\pm9)\times10^{-11}\text{ yr}^{-1}$. The observed energy deviation was also used to determine the rate of change of the quintessence-like field ($\dot{Q}_0$) for tracking models: $\dot{Q}_{0,max} = (3\pm 4)\times10^7 \text{ GeV/yr}$. Our findings are consistent with the cosmological constant ($\dot{Q}_0 =0$). Furthermore, we have demonstrated how nuclear spectra produced by astrophysical events can be used to inform the nature and behavior of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Investigation of ground state properties and shape evolution in Hf isotopes using the CDFT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground-state properties and shape evolution of even-even hafnium isotopes ranging from $N=80$ to the neutron dripline are thoroughly examined using Covariant Density Functional Theory (CDFT) with density-dependent effective interactions, specifically the parameter sets DD-ME1, DD-ME2, DD-PC1, and DD-PCX. Key nuclear properties, including binding energies, two-neutron separation energies ($S_{2n}$), two-neutron shell gaps ($\delta S_{2n}$), neutron pairing energies ($E_{pair,n}$), quadrupole deformation parameters ($\beta_2$), root-mean-square (RMS) charge and matter radii, and neutron skin thickness ($\Delta r_{np}$), are systematically computed and compared with available experimental results and predictions from various theoretical models. These include the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) framework employing the Skyrme SLy4 interaction, the Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM), the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) using the PC-PK1 functional, and the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with NL3 parameterization. Shell closures at $N=82$ and $N=126$, subshell effects at $N=108$ and $N=152$, and shape transitions with coexistence in $^{192}$Hf and $^{222-236}$Hf are observed. Neutron skin thickness increases with neutron excess, and potential energy surfaces show consistent trends, validating CDFT's reliability for nuclear structure predictions.</description>

Abstract: We present an overview of theoretical and phenomenological studies on the partonic structure of nuclei and small-$x$ QCD dynamics using photon-nucleus $(\gamma A$) scattering in heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs). Focusing on nuclear shadowing, we review implications of coherent charmonium and inclusive dijet production in Pb-Pb UPCs at the LHC and discuss the potential of inelastic $\gamma A$ scattering accompanied by forward neutrons in a zero degree calorimeter (ZDC).</description>

      <title>Decay spectroscopy of heavy and superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04053v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After more than half a century after the first predictions of the so-called "island of stability of superheavy nuclei", exploring the limits of nuclear stability at highest atomic numbers is still one of the most prominent challenges in low-energy nuclear physics. These exotic nuclear species reveal their character and details of some of their properties by their induced or spontaneous disintegration. The achievements in the field superheavy nuclei (SHN) research have been reported in a number of review papers throughout the decades. This review is an attempt to summarize the progress that has been made in recent years by employing the versatile tool park of Decay Spectroscopy After Separation (DSAS) for the heaviest isotopes from Z=99 (einsteinium) to Z=118 (oganesson). In addition, references to earlier reviews and the relevant papers, together with the major decay properties of all these isotopes are given.</description>

      <title>Transverse spin effects and light-quark dipole moments at lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to probe light-quark dipole interactions at lepton colliders using the azimuthal asymmetry of a collinear dihadron pair $(h_1h_2)$ produced in association with another hadron $h'$. This asymmetry, arising from quantum interference in the quark spin space, is exclusively sensitive to dipole interactions at the leading power of the new physics scale and simultaneously probes both the real and imaginary components of the dipole couplings. By combining all possible channels of $h'$, this method allows for disentangling the up and down quark dipole moments and has the potential to significantly strengthen current constraints by one to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed analysis of longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider(LHC) energies for the first time. We compare different theoretical models of the oxygen structure and find that certain observables, such as the flow vector correlator, can distinguish between them, particularly highlighting differences between the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) structure and other models, such as Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM), which behave similarly. We further examine flow decorrelations across different systems, including d+Au and O+O collisions at 200 GeV, as well as Ne+Ne and O+O collisions at 6.37 TeV, indicating a hierarchy in decorrelations that underscores the complexity of these interactions. Our findings emphasize that the role of asymmetry in d+Au collisions and its impact on flow correlations is mitigated using a modified flow correlation defined as a ratio of two flow vector covariances derived from different pairs of pseudorapidity bins. Additionally, our analysis of flow angle decorrelations shows diverse distributions across various systems, finding distinct patterns in d+Au collisions compared to other collision systems.</description>

      <title>High efficiency quantification of $^{90}$Sr contamination in cow milk after a nuclear accident</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring $^{90}$Sr contamination in milk following a nuclear accident is critical due to its radiotoxicity and calcium-mimicking behaviour, leading to accumulation in bones and teeth. This study presents a high-efficiency protocol for quantifying$^{90}$Sr in cow milk by integrating freeze-drying, high-temperature calcination, ion exchange chromatography and liquid scintillation spectroscopy (LSC). The method was validated using reference milk samples with 0.45~Bq/mL of $^{90}$Sr, achieving a chemical yield of 100 $\pm$ 2\%, ensuring near-complete recovery and accurate quantification.
  The minimum detectable activity (MDA) was estimated at 0.33 Bq/L under optimal conditions, demonstrating the protocol's sensitivity for low-level detection. A comparative analysis with existing methods centrifugation-based approaches and Dowex resin techniques revealed that our protocol outperforms in both strontium recovery and organic matter elimination. Alternative methods showed lower recovery rates (68 $\pm$ 2\% for Gu\'erin's method, 65 $\pm$6\% for Dowex resin) and suffered from procedural drawbacks, such as incomplete organic matter removal.
  Applying this methodology to compare samples from certified laboratories confirmed its robustness, with liquid scintillation spectroscopy radioactivity values doubling after 14 days, consistent with secular equilibrium between $^{90}$Sr and $^{90}$Y. While the protocol is optimized for milk, future research should explore its applicability to other food matrices. The high yield, reliability, and ease of implementation position this method as an effective tool for nuclear emergency response and routine radiological monitoring.</description>
