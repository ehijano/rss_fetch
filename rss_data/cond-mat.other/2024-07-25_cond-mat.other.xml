      <title>Partitioning of total charge in matter from geometric phases of electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on geometric phases of Bloch electrons computed from first-principles, we propose a scheme for unambiguous partitioning of charge in matter, derivable directly from the Kohn-Sham states. Generalizing the fact that geometric phases acquired by electrons due to evolution of their crystal momentum $\vec k$ in a direction through out the Brillouin zone(BZ), provide position of their localization with net minimum spread along the corresponding direction in real space. We find that the total charge can be meaningfully distributed into charge centres simultaneously contributed by triads of electrons with their crystal momentum evolving linearly independently through each unique $\vec k$ across the BZ. The resultant map of charge centres readily renders not only the qualitative nature of inter-atomic as well as intra-atomic hybridization of electrons, but also unbiased quantitative estimates of electrons on atoms or shared between them, as demonstrated in a select variety of isolated and periodic systems with varying degree of sharing of valence electrons among atoms, including variants of multi-centered bonds.</description>

      <title>An analytic method for quadratic polarons in nonparabolic bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Including the effect of lattice anharmonicity on electron-phonon interactions has recently garnered attention due to its role as a necessary and significant component in explaining various phenomena, including superconductivity, optical response, and temperature dependence of mobility. This study focuses on analytically treating the effects of anharmonic electron-phonon coupling on the polaron self-energy, combined with numerical Diagrammatic Monte Carlo data. Specifically, we incorporate a quadratic interaction into the method of squeezed phonon states, which has proven effective for analytically calculating the polaron parameters. Additionally, we extend this method to nonparabolic finite-width conduction bands while maintaining the periodic translation symmetry of the system. Our results are compared with those obtained from Diagrammatic Monte Carlo, partially reported in a recent study [Phys. Rev. B 107, L121109(2023)], covering a wide range of coupling strengths for the nonlinear interaction. Remarkably, our analytic method predicts the same features as the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in Krylov Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization in closed non-integrable quantum systems using the Krylov basis. We demonstrate that for thermalization to occur, the matrix representation of typical local operators in the Krylov basis should exhibit a specific tridiagonal form with all other elements in the matrix are exponentially small, reminiscent of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Within this framework, we propose that the nature of thermalization, whether weak or strong, can be examined by the infinite time average of the Krylov complexity. Moreover, we analyze the variance of Lanczos coefficients as another probe for the nature of thermalization. One observes that although the variance of Lanczos coefficients may capture certain features of thermalization, it is not as effective as the infinite time average of complexity.</description>
