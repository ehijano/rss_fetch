      <title>G-EvoNAS: Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search Based on Network Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolutionary paradigm has been successfully applied to neural network search(NAS) in recent years. Due to the vast search complexity of the global space, current research mainly seeks to repeatedly stack partial architectures to build the entire model or to seek the entire model based on manually designed benchmark modules. The above two methods are attempts to reduce the search difficulty by narrowing the search space. To efficiently search network architecture in the global space, this paper proposes another solution, namely a computationally efficient neural architecture evolutionary search framework based on network growth (G-EvoNAS). The complete network is obtained by gradually deepening different Blocks. The process begins from a shallow network, grows and evolves, and gradually deepens into a complete network, reducing the search complexity in the global space. Then, to improve the ranking accuracy of the network, we reduce the weight coupling of each network in the SuperNet by pruning the SuperNet according to elite groups at different growth stages. The G-EvoNAS is tested on three commonly used image classification datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, and compared with various state-of-the-art algorithms, including hand-designed networks and NAS networks. Experimental results demonstrate that G-EvoNAS can find a neural network architecture comparable to state-of-the-art designs in 0.2 GPU days.</description>

      <title>Mem-elements based Neuromorphic Hardware for Neural Network Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thesis investigates the utilization of memristive and memcapacitive crossbar arrays in low-power machine learning accelerators, offering a comprehensive co-design framework for deep neural networks (DNN). The model, implemented through a hybrid Python and PyTorch approach, accounts for various non-idealities, achieving exceptional training accuracies of 90.02% and 91.03% for the CIFAR-10 dataset with memristive and memcapacitive crossbar arrays on an 8-layer VGG network. Additionally, the thesis introduces a novel approach to emulate meminductor devices using Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (OTA) and capacitors, showcasing adjustable behavior. Transistor-level simulations in 180 nm CMOS technology, operating at 60 MHz, demonstrate the proposed meminductor emulator's viability with a power consumption of 0.337 mW. The design is further validated in neuromorphic circuits and CNN accelerators, achieving training and testing accuracies of 91.04% and 88.82%, respectively. Notably, the exclusive use of MOS transistors ensures the feasibility of monolithic IC fabrication. This research significantly contributes to the exploration of advanced hardware solutions for efficient and high-performance machine-learning applications.</description>

      <title>Encodings for Prediction-based Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictor-based methods have substantially enhanced Neural Architecture Search (NAS) optimization. The efficacy of these predictors is largely influenced by the method of encoding neural network architectures. While traditional encodings used an adjacency matrix describing the graph structure of a neural network, novel encodings embrace a variety of approaches from unsupervised pretraining of latent representations to vectors of zero-cost proxies. In this paper, we categorize and investigate neural encodings from three main types: structural, learned, and score-based. Furthermore, we extend these encodings and introduce \textit{unified encodings}, that extend NAS predictors to multiple search spaces. Our analysis draws from experiments conducted on over 1.5 million neural network architectures on NAS spaces such as NASBench-101 (NB101), NB201, NB301, Network Design Spaces (NDS), and TransNASBench-101. Building on our study, we present our predictor \textbf{FLAN}: \textbf{Fl}ow \textbf{A}ttention for \textbf{N}AS. FLAN integrates critical insights on predictor design, transfer learning, and \textit{unified encodings} to enable more than an order of magnitude cost reduction for training NAS accuracy predictors. Our implementation and encodings for all neural networks are open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/flan_nas}{https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/flan\_nas}.</description>

      <title>SOFIM: Stochastic Optimization Using Regularized Fisher Information Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new stochastic optimization method based on the regularized Fisher information matrix (FIM), named SOFIM, which can efficiently utilize the FIM to approximate the Hessian matrix for finding Newton's gradient update in large-scale stochastic optimization of machine learning models. It can be viewed as a variant of natural gradient descent (NGD), where the challenge of storing and calculating the full FIM is addressed through making use of the regularized FIM and directly finding the gradient update direction via Sherman-Morrison matrix inversion. Additionally, like the popular Adam method, SOFIM uses the first moment of the gradient to address the issue of non-stationary objectives across mini-batches due to heterogeneous data. The utilization of the regularized FIM and Sherman-Morrison matrix inversion leads to the improved convergence rate with the same space and time complexities as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum. The extensive experiments on training deep learning models on several benchmark image classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed SOFIM outperforms SGD with momentum and several state-of-the-art Newton optimization methods, such as Nystrom-SGD, L-BFGS, and AdaHessian, in term of the convergence speed for achieving the pre-specified objectives of training and test losses as well as test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Evolution Transformer: In-Context Evolutionary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary optimization algorithms are often derived from loose biological analogies and struggle to leverage information obtained during the sequential course of optimization. An alternative promising approach is to leverage data and directly discover powerful optimization principles via meta-optimization. In this work, we follow such a paradigm and introduce Evolution Transformer, a causal Transformer architecture, which can flexibly characterize a family of Evolution Strategies. Given a trajectory of evaluations and search distribution statistics, Evolution Transformer outputs a performance-improving update to the search distribution. The architecture imposes a set of suitable inductive biases, i.e. the invariance of the distribution update to the order of population members within a generation and equivariance to the order of the search dimensions. We train the model weights using Evolutionary Algorithm Distillation, a technique for supervised optimization of sequence models using teacher algorithm trajectories. The resulting model exhibits strong in-context optimization performance and shows strong generalization capabilities to otherwise challenging neuroevolution tasks. We analyze the resulting properties of the Evolution Transformer and propose a technique to fully self-referentially train the Evolution Transformer, starting from a random initialization and bootstrapping its own learning progress. We provide an open source implementation under https://github.com/RobertTLange/evosax.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Symbolic Regression Datasets and Benchmarks for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10540v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits datasets and evaluation criteria for Symbolic Regression (SR), specifically focused on its potential for scientific discovery. Focused on a set of formulas used in the existing datasets based on Feynman Lectures on Physics, we recreate 120 datasets to discuss the performance of symbolic regression for scientific discovery (SRSD). For each of the 120 SRSD datasets, we carefully review the properties of the formula and its variables to design reasonably realistic sampling ranges of values so that our new SRSD datasets can be used for evaluating the potential of SRSD such as whether or not an SR method can (re)discover physical laws from such datasets. We also create another 120 datasets that contain dummy variables to examine whether SR methods can choose necessary variables only. Besides, we propose to use normalized edit distances (NED) between a predicted equation and the true equation trees for addressing a critical issue that existing SR metrics are either binary or errors between the target values and an SR model's predicted values for a given input. We conduct benchmark experiments on our new SRSD datasets using various representative SR methods. The experimental results show that we provide a more realistic performance evaluation, and our user study shows that the NED correlates with human judges significantly more than an existing SR metric. We publish repositories of our code and 240 SRSD datasets.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Exploratory Learning-Aided Community Detection Under Topological Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social networks, the discovery of community structures has received considerable attention as a fundamental problem in various network analysis tasks. However, due to privacy concerns or access restrictions, the network structure is often uncertain, thereby rendering established community detection approaches ineffective without costly network topology acquisition. To tackle this challenge, we present META-CODE, a unified framework for detecting overlapping communities via exploratory learning aided by easy-to-collect node metadata when networks are topologically unknown (or only partially known). Specifically, META-CODE consists of three iterative steps in addition to the initial network inference step: 1) node-level community-affiliation embeddings based on graph neural networks (GNNs) trained by our new reconstruction loss, 2) network exploration via community-affiliation-based node queries, and 3) network inference using an edge connectivity-based Siamese neural network model from the explored network. Through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets including two large networks, we demonstrated: (a) the superiority of META-CODE over benchmark community detection methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 151.27% compared to the best existing competitor, (b) the impact of each module in META-CODE, (c) the effectiveness of node queries in META-CODE based on empirical evaluations and theoretical findings, (d) the convergence of the inferred network, and (e) the computational efficiency of META-CODE.</description>

      <title>Synaptic Weight Distributions Depend on the Geometry of Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing literature in computational neuroscience leverages gradient descent and learning algorithms that approximate it to study synaptic plasticity in the brain. However, the vast majority of this work ignores a critical underlying assumption: the choice of distance for synaptic changes - i.e. the geometry of synaptic plasticity. Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with non-Euclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning. Overall, our work shows that the current paradigm in theoretical work on synaptic plasticity that assumes Euclidean synaptic geometry may be misguided and that it should be possible to experimentally determine the true geometry of synaptic plasticity in the brain.</description>

      <title>A Prefrontal Cortex-inspired Architecture for Planning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, but they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or goal-directed planning. To address this, we take inspiration from the human brain, in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent interaction of specialized modules in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These modules perform functions such as conflict monitoring, state prediction, state evaluation, task decomposition, and task coordination. We find that LLMs are sometimes capable of carrying out these functions in isolation, but struggle to autonomously coordinate them in the service of a goal. Therefore, we propose a black box architecture with multiple LLM-based (GPT-4) modules. The architecture improves planning through the interaction of specialized PFC-inspired modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief automated calls to the LLM. We evaluate the combined architecture on three challenging planning tasks -- graph traversal, Tower of Hanoi, and logistics -- finding that it yields significant improvements over standard LLM methods (e.g., zero-shot prompting, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought). These results demonstrate the benefit of utilizing knowledge from cognitive neuroscience to improve planning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>TransNAS-TSAD: Harnessing Transformers for Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search in Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surge in real-time data collection across various industries has underscored the need for advanced anomaly detection in both univariate and multivariate time series data. This paper introduces TransNAS-TSAD, a framework that synergizes the transformer architecture with neural architecture search (NAS), enhanced through NSGA-II algorithm optimization. This approach effectively tackles the complexities of time series data, balancing computational efficiency with detection accuracy. Our evaluation reveals that TransNAS-TSAD surpasses conventional anomaly detection models due to its tailored architectural adaptability and the efficient exploration of complex search spaces, leading to marked improvements in diverse data scenarios. We also introduce the Efficiency-Accuracy-Complexity Score (EACS) as a new metric for assessing model performance, emphasizing the balance between accuracy and computational resources. TransNAS-TSAD sets a new benchmark in time series anomaly detection, offering a versatile, efficient solution for complex real-world applications. This research highlights the TransNAS-TSAD potential across a wide range of industry applications and paves the way for future developments in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise glucose level monitoring is critical for people with diabetes to avoid serious complications. While there are several methods for continuous glucose level monitoring, research on maintenance devices is limited. To mitigate the gap, we provide a novel neural control system for continuous glucose monitoring and management that uses differential predictive control. Our approach, led by a sophisticated neural policy and differentiable modeling, constantly adjusts insulin supply in real-time, thereby improving glucose level optimization in the body. This end-to-end method maximizes efficiency, providing personalized care and improved health outcomes, as confirmed by empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>LLaMoCo: Instruction Tuning of Large Language Models for Optimization Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research explores optimization using large language models (LLMs) by either iteratively seeking next-step solutions from LLMs or directly prompting LLMs for an optimizer. However, these approaches exhibit inherent limitations, including low operational efficiency, high sensitivity to prompt design, and a lack of domain-specific knowledge. We introduce LLaMoCo, the first instruction-tuning framework designed to adapt LLMs for solving optimization problems in a code-to-code manner. Specifically, we establish a comprehensive instruction set containing well-described problem prompts and effective optimization codes. We then develop a novel two-phase learning strategy that incorporates a contrastive learning-based warm-up procedure before the instruction-tuning phase to enhance the convergence behavior during model fine-tuning. The experiment results demonstrate that a CodeGen (350M) model fine-tuned by our LLaMoCo achieves superior optimization performance compared to GPT-4 Turbo and the other competitors across both synthetic and realistic problem sets. The fine-tuned model and the usage instructions are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLaMoCo-722A.</description>
