      <title>Active learning of digenic functions with boolean matrix logic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery, based on comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs). Predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs. Learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</description>

      <title>Geometry of the signed support of a multivariate polynomial and Descartes' rule of signs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the signed support, that is, the set of the exponent vectors and the signs of the coefficients, of a multivariate polynomial $f$. We describe conditions on the signed support ensuring that the semi-algebraic set, denoted as $\{ f &lt; 0 \}$, containing points in the positive real orthant where $f$ takes negative values, has at most one connected component. These results generalize Descartes' rule of signs in the sense that they provide a bound which is independent of the values of the coefficients and the degree of the polynomial. Based on how the exponent vectors lie on the faces of the Newton polytope, we give a recursive algorithm that verifies a sufficient condition for the set $\{ f &lt; 0 \}$ to have one connected component. We apply the algorithm to reaction networks in order to prove that the parameter region of multistationarity of a ubiquitous network comprising phosphorylation cycles is connected.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling of Flexible EHD Pumps using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to predicting the pressure and flow rate of flexible electrohydrodynamic pumps using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KAN replaces fixed activation functions with learnable spline-based activation functions, enabling it to approximate complex nonlinear functions more effectively than traditional models like Multi-Layer Perceptron and Random Forest. We evaluated KAN on a dataset of flexible EHD pump parameters and compared its performance against RF, and MLP models. KAN achieved superior predictive accuracy, with Mean Squared Errors of 12.186 and 0.001 for pressure and flow rate predictions, respectively. The symbolic formulas extracted from KAN provided insights into the nonlinear relationships between input parameters and pump performance. These findings demonstrate that KAN offers exceptional accuracy and interpretability, making it a promising alternative for predictive modeling in electrohydrodynamic pumping.</description>

      <title>A Neurosymbolic Approach to Adaptive Feature Extraction in SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots, autonomous vehicles, and humans wearing mixed-reality headsets require accurate and reliable tracking services for safety-critical applications in dynamically changing real-world environments. However, the existing tracking approaches, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), do not adapt well to environmental changes and boundary conditions despite extensive manual tuning. On the other hand, while deep learning-based approaches can better adapt to environmental changes, they typically demand substantial data for training and often lack flexibility in adapting to new domains. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging the neurosymbolic program synthesis approach to construct adaptable SLAM pipelines that integrate the domain knowledge from traditional SLAM approaches while leveraging data to learn complex relationships. While the approach can synthesize end-to-end SLAM pipelines, we focus on synthesizing the feature extraction module. We first devise a domain-specific language (DSL) that can encapsulate domain knowledge on the important attributes for feature extraction and the real-world performance of various feature extractors. Our neurosymbolic architecture then undertakes adaptive feature extraction, optimizing parameters via learning while employing symbolic reasoning to select the most suitable feature extractor. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach, neurosymbolic Feature EXtraction (nFEX), yields higher-quality features. It also reduces the pose error observed for the state-of-the-art baseline feature extractors ORB and SIFT by up to 90% and up to 66%, respectively, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency and adaptability to novel environments.</description>
