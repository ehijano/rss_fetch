      <title>An improved, high yield method for isolating nuclei from individual zebrafish embryos for single-nucleus RNA sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zebrafish are an ideal system to study the effect(s) of chemical, genetic, and environmental perturbations on development due to their high fecundity and fast growth. Recently, single cell sequencing has emerged as a powerful tool to measure the effect of these perturbations at a whole embryo scale. These types of experiments rely on the ability to isolate nuclei from a large number of individually barcoded zebrafish embryos in parallel. Here we report a method for efficiently isolating high-quality nuclei from zebrafish embryos in a 96-well plate format by bead homogenization in a lysis buffer. Through head-to-head sciPlex-RNA-seq experiments, we demonstrate that this method represents a substantial improvement over enzymatic dissociation and that it is compatible with a wide range of developmental stages.</description>

      <title>Group-wise normalization in differential abundance analysis of microbiome samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in differential abundance analysis of microbial samples is that the counts for each sample are compositional, resulting in biased comparisons of the absolute abundance across study groups. Normalization-based differential abundance analysis methods rely on external normalization factors that account for the compositionality by standardizing the counts onto a common numerical scale. However, existing normalization methods have struggled at maintaining the false discovery rate in settings where the variance or compositional bias is large. This article proposes a novel framework for normalization that can reduce bias in differential abundance analysis by re-conceptualizing normalization as a group-level task. We present two normalization methods within the group-wise framework: group-wise relative log expression (G-RLE) and fold-truncated sum scaling (FTSS). G-RLE and FTSS achieve higher statistical power for identifying differentially abundant taxa than existing methods in model-based and synthetic data simulation settings, while maintaining the false discovery rate in challenging scenarios where existing methods suffer. The best results are obtained from using FTSS normalization with the differential abundance analysis method MetagenomeSeq. Code for implementing the methods and replicating the analysis can be found at our GitHub page (https://github.com/dclarkboucher/microbiome_groupwise_normalization).</description>

      <title>The Updated Genome Warehouse: Enhancing Data Value, Security, and Usability to Address Data Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Genome Warehouse (GWH), accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gwh, is an extensively utilized public repository dedicated to the deposition, management and sharing of genome assembly sequences, annotations, and metadata. This paper highlights noteworthy enhancements to the GWH since the 2021 version, emphasizing substantial advancements in web interfaces for data submission, database functionality updates, and resource integration. Key updates include the reannotation of released prokaryotic genomes, mirroring of genome resources from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank and RefSeq, integration of Poxviridae sequences, implementation of an online batch submission system, enhancements to the quality control system, advanced search capabilities, and the introduction of a controlled-access mechanism for human genome data. These improvements collectively augment the ease and security of data submission and access as well as genome data value, thereby fostering heightened convenience and utility for researchers in the genomic field.</description>

      <title>Deciphering genomic codes using advanced NLP techniques: a scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: The vast and complex nature of human genomic sequencing data presents challenges for effective analysis. This review aims to investigate the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformer architectures, in deciphering genomic codes, focusing on tokenization, transformer models, and regulatory annotation prediction. The goal of this review is to assess data and model accessibility in the most recent literature, gaining a better understanding of the existing capabilities and constraints of these tools in processing genomic sequencing data.
  Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, our scoping review was conducted across PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and ACM Digital Library. Studies were included if they focused on NLP methodologies applied to genomic sequencing data analysis, without restrictions on publication date or article type.
  Results: A total of 26 studies published between 2021 and April 2024 were selected for review. The review highlights that tokenization and transformer models enhance the processing and understanding of genomic data, with applications in predicting regulatory annotations like transcription-factor binding sites and chromatin accessibility.
  Discussion: The application of NLP and LLMs to genomic sequencing data interpretation is a promising field that can help streamline the processing of large-scale genomic data while also providing a better understanding of its complex structures. It has the potential to drive advancements in personalized medicine by offering more efficient and scalable solutions for genomic analysis. Further research is also needed to discuss and overcome current limitations, enhancing model transparency and applicability.</description>

      <title>Assumption-Lean Post-Integrated Inference with Negative Control Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data integration methods aim to extract low-dimensional embeddings from high-dimensional outcomes to remove unwanted variations, such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates, across heterogeneous datasets. However, multiple hypothesis testing after integration can be biased due to data-dependent processes. We introduce a robust post-integrated inference (PII) method that adjusts for latent heterogeneity using negative control outcomes. Leveraging causal interpretations, we derive nonparametric identifiability of the direct effects, which motivates our semiparametric inference method. Our method extends to projected direct effect estimands, accounting for hidden mediators, confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide bias quantifications and finite-sample linear expansions with uniform concentration bounds. The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under minimal assumptions and potential misspecification, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine learning algorithms. Our proposal is evaluated with random forests through simulations and analysis of single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets with potential unmeasured confounders.</description>
