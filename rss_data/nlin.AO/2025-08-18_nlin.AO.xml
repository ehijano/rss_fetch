      <title>The Mathematical Theory of Behavioural Swarms: Towards Modelling the Collective Dynamics of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical swarm models, exemplified by the Cucker--Smale framework, provide foundational insights into collective alignment but exhibit fundamental limitations in capturing the adaptive, heterogeneous behaviours intrinsic to living systems. This paper formalises the mathematical theory of \textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's state incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \textit{activity} that co-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We demonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive decision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous differential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd dynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic patterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions this framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based approaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where individual agency drives collective outcomes.</description>

      <title>Intermediate time scale in the first product formation time distribution of Michaelis-Menten kinetics with inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Michaelis-Menten kinetics is one of the most recognized models in enzyme kinetics, crucial for the understanding of biochemical reactions in several metabolic processes. In this study, we perform a stochastic analysis of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the introduction of inhibitory mechanisms, which significantly diversifies the study of the reaction. We apply the Fock space formalism to reformulate the master equation, transforming it into a Schr\"odinger-type equation. We investigate reversible inhibitions and analyze the behavior of the averaged number of substances involved, identifying a stiffness behavior in all scenarios. In a specific case of partial inhibition, we observe that the inhibitor can act as an activator that favors product formation. We calculate the first product formation time (FPFT), which characterizes the time statistic of the first product formation. We observe the emergence of an intermediate time scale in addition to the two known time scales typical in first-passage problems. This intermediate time scale is closely aligned with the slow-binding kinetics observed in experimentally observed enzymatic reactions that involve inhibitors. This intermediate time scale is related to the new pathways introduced by the presence of inhibitors. This study offers a new perspective on inhibited enzymatic reactions, and demonstrates the usefulness of the Fock space formalism in the analysis of complex chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Memory as Structured Trajectories: Persistent Homology and Contextual Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a topological framework for memory and inference grounded in the structure of spike-timing dynamics, persistent homology, and the Context-Content Uncertainty Principle (CCUP). Starting from the observation that polychronous neural groups (PNGs) encode reproducible, time-locked spike sequences shaped by axonal delays and synaptic plasticity, we construct spatiotemporal complexes whose temporally consistent transitions define chain complexes over which robust activation cycles emerge. These activation loops are abstracted into cell posets, enabling a compact and causally ordered representation of neural activity with overlapping and compositional memory traces. We introduce the delta-homology analogy, which formalizes memory as a set of sparse, topologically irreducible attractors. A Dirac delta-like memory trace is identified with a nontrivial homology generator on a latent manifold of cognitive states. Such traces are sharply localized along reproducible topological cycles and are only activated when inference trajectories complete a full cycle. They encode minimal, path-dependent memory units that cannot be synthesized from local features alone. We interpret these delta-homology generators as the low-entropy content variable, while the high-entropy context variable is represented dually as a filtration, cohomology class, or sheaf over the same latent space. Inference is recast as a dynamic alignment between content and context and coherent memory retrieval corresponds to the existence of a global section that selects and sustains a topological generator. Memory is no longer a static attractor or distributed code, but a cycle-completing, structure-aware inference process.</description>

      <title>Synchronization Dynamics of Heterogeneous, Collaborative Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel interdisciplinary framework that bridges synchronization theory and multi-agent AI systems by adapting the Kuramoto model to describe the collective dynamics of heterogeneous AI agents engaged in complex task execution. By representing AI agents as coupled oscillators with both phase and amplitude dynamics, our model captures essential aspects of agent specialization, influence, and communication within networked systems. We introduce an order parameter to quantify the degree of coordination and synchronization, providing insights into how coupling strength, agent diversity, and network topology impact emergent collective behavior. Furthermore, we formalize a detailed correspondence between Chain-of-Thought prompting in AI reasoning and synchronization phenomena, unifying human-like iterative problem solving with emergent group intelligence. Through extensive simulations on all-to-all and deterministic scale-free networks, we demonstrate that increased coupling promotes robust synchronization despite heterogeneous agent capabilities, reflecting realistic collaborative AI scenarios. Our physics-informed approach establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for designing, analyzing, and optimizing scalable, adaptive, and interpretable multi-agent AI systems. This work opens pathways for principled orchestration of agentic AI and lays the groundwork for future incorporation of learning dynamics and adaptive network architectures to further enhance system resilience and efficiency.</description>

      <title>[Social] Allostasis: Or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of homeostasis typically conceptualises biological and artificial systems as maintaining stability by resisting deviations caused by environmental and social perturbations. In contrast, (social) allostasis proposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations to reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental demands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This paper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic regulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers, analogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from both the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic reconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across several dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that allostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage environmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to improved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work offers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis and their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems</description>

      <title>Network inference applicable to both synchronous and desynchronous systems from oscillatory signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is ubiquitous in nature, which is mathematically described by coupled oscillators. Synchronization strongly depends on the interaction network, and the network plays a crucial role in controlling the dynamics. To understand and control synchronization dynamics in the real world, it is essential to identify the network from the observed data. While previous studies have developed the methods for inferring the network of asynchronous systems, it remains challenging to infer the network of well-synchronized oscillators. In this study, we develop a method for inferring the network of synchronized and desynchronized oscillators from time series. Our method expands the applicability of network inference to a wider class of oscillatory systems. The proposed method discards a large part of data used for inference, which may seem counterintuitive. However, the effectiveness of the method is supported by the phase reduction theory, a well-established theory for weakly coupled oscillators. We verify the proposed method by applying it to simulated data of the limit-cycle oscillators. This study provides an important step towards understanding synchronization in real-world systems from a network perspective.</description>

      <title>The Role of Connection Density in an Adaptive Network with Chaotic Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of connection density in an adaptive network model of chaotic units that dynamically rewire based on their internal states and local coherence. By systematically varying the network's connectivity density, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes and structural transitions, revealing mechanisms of spontaneous modularity, dynamical segregation, and integration. We find that at higher densities, the network exhibits both local clustering and global synchrony. Additionally, we observe that low-density networks tend to fragment into desynchronized clusters, while high-density networks converge to synchronized states combining strong global integration with persistent modular segregation. Inspired by neural architectures, our model provides a general framework for understanding how simple microscopic rules can give rise to complex emergent behaviors in dynamical networks.</description>

      <title>Self-organization to multicriticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-organized criticality is a well-established phenomenon, where a system dynamically tunes its structure to operate on the verge of a phase transition. Here, we show that the dynamics inside the self-organized critical state are fundamentally far more versatile than previously recognized, to the extent that a system can self-organize to a new type of phase transition while staying on the verge of another. In this first demonstration of self-organization to multicriticality, we investigate a model of coupled oscillators on a random network, where the network topology evolves in response to the oscillator dynamics. We show that the system first self-organizes to the onset of oscillations, after which it drifts to the onset of pattern formation while still remaining at the onset of oscillations, thus becoming critical in two different ways at once. The observed evolution to multicriticality is robust generic behavior that we expect to be widespread in self-organizing systems. Overall, these results offer a unifying framework for studying systems, such as the brain, where multiple phase transitions may be relevant for proper functioning.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.</description>
