      <title>Existence of Vortex Patch Equilibria for Active Scalars Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of a finite number of vortex patches for the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic (gSQG) equations with $\alpha \in [1,2)$, focusing on configurations that may rotate uniformly, translate, or remain stationary. Using a desingularization technique, we reformulate the problem to resolve singularities arising in the point vortex limit. Assuming a nondegenerate equilibrium of the point vortices, we apply the implicit function theorem to construct time-periodic solutions to the gSQG equations, offering asymptotic descriptions of the vortex patch boundaries.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Hardy type inequalities with weights and conformable fractional differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a systematic development of fundamental concepts of conformable calculus we establish conformable divergence theorem and Green's identities which we combine with some new anisotropic Picone type identities to derive a generalized anisotropic Hardy type inequality with weights and conformable fractional differential operators. As a consequence, several Hardy type inequalities and Heisenberg Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principles are obtained.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for the semilinear wave equations with nonlinear damping on manifolds with conical degeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with a class of semilinear wave equation with nonlinear damping term $|u_{t}|^{m-2}u_t $ and nonlinear source term $g(x)|u|^{p-2}u$ on the manifolds with conical singularities. Firstly, we prove the local existence and uniqueness of the solution by the semigroup method. Secondly, we establish the global existence, the energy decay estimate and the blow-up in finite time of the solution with subcritial ($E(0)&lt;d$) and critial ($E(0)=d$) initial energy level by constructing potential wells. We also show that the solution is global provided the damping dominates the source (that is $m\geq p$). Moreover, we prove the blow-up in finite time of the solution with arbitrary positive initial energy and give some necessary and sufficient condition for existing finite time blow-up solutions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically almost Periodic Solutions of the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel systems on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence, uniqueness, and exponential decay of asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) mild solutions for the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel systems on a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with a smooth boundary. First, we establish the well-posedness of mild solutions for the corresponding linear systems by utilizing the dispersive and smoothing estimates of the Neumann heat semigroup on the bounded domain $\Omega$. We then prove the existence and uniqueness of AAP-mild solutions for the linear systems by providing a Massera-type principle. Next, using results of the linear systems and fixed-point arguments, we derive the well-posedness of such solutions for the Keller-Segel systems. Finally, the exponential decay of these solutions is demonstrated through a Gronwall-type inequality.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and self-similar solution of the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global well-posedness of the 3-D inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes system (INS in short) with initial density $\rho_0$ being discontinuous and initial velocity $u_0$ belonging to some critical space. Firstly, if $\rho_0u_0$ is sufficiently small in the space $\dot{B}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}_{p,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ and $\rho_0$ is close enough to a positive constant in $L^\infty$, we establish the global existence of strong solution to (INS) for $3&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and provide the uniqueness of the solution for $3&lt;p&lt;6$. This result corresponds to Cannone-Meyer-Planchon solution of the classical Navier-Stokes system. Furthermore, with the additional assumption that $u_0\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$, we prove the weak-strong uniqueness between Cannone-Meyer-Planchon solution and Lions weak solution of (INS). Finally, we prove the global well-posedness of (INS) with $u_0\in \dot{B}^{\frac{1}{2}}_{2,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ being small and only an upper bound on the density. This gives the first existence result of the forward self-similar solution for (INS).</description>

      <title>Global existence and large-time behavior of solutions to cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger systems without coercive conserved quantity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the large-time behavior of small solutions to a system of one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with two components. In previous studies, a structural condition on the nonlinearity has been employed to guarantee the existence of a coercive, mass-type conserved quantity. We identify a new class of systems that do not satisfy such a condition and thus lack a coercive conserved quantity. Nonetheless, we establish the global existence and describe the large-time behavior for small solutions in this class. In this setting, the asymptotic profile is described in terms of solutions to the corresponding system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A key element of our analysis is the use of a quartic conserved quantity associated with the ODE system. Moreover, for a specific example within this class, we solve the ODE system explicitly, showing that the asymptotic behavior is expressed using Jacobi elliptic functions.</description>

      <title>Blow up versus scattering below the mass-energy threshold for the focusing NLH with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the blow up and scattering result of the solution to the focusing nonlinear Hartree equation with potential $$i\partial_t u +\Delta u - Vu = - (|\cdot|^{-3} \ast |u|^2)u, \qquad (t, x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^5 $$ in the energy space ${H}^1(\mathbb{R}^5)$ below the mass-energy threshold. The potential $V$ we considered is an extension of Kato potential in some sense. We extend the results of Meng [26] to nonlinear Hartree equation with potential $V$ under some conditions. By establishing a Virial-Morawetz estimate and a scattering criteria, we obtain the scattering theory based on the method from Dodson-Murphy [11].</description>

      <title>Sharp regularity of gradient blow-up solutions in the Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of singularities in the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation, providing a detailed description of the blow-up dynamics and identifying the precise H\"older regularity of the gradient blow-up solutions. To this end, we first construct self-similar blow-up profiles and examine their properties, including the asymptotic behavior at infinity, which determines the type of singularity. Using these profiles as a reference and employing modulation theory, we establish global pointwise estimates for the blow-up solutions in self-similar variables, thereby demonstrating the stability of the self-similar profiles we construct. Our results indicate that the solutions, evolving from smooth initial data within a fairly general open set, form $C^{3/5}$ cusps as the first singularity in finite time. These singularities are analogous to \emph{pre-shocks} emerging in the Burgers equation, exhibiting unbounded gradients while the solutions themselves remain bounded. However, the nature of the singularity differs from that of the Burgers equation, which is a cubic-root singularity, i.e., $C^{1/3}$. Our work provides the first proof that generic pre-shocks of the CH equation exhibit $C^{3/5}$ H\"older regularity. It is our construction of new self-similar profiles, incorporating the precise leading-order correction to the CH equation in the blow-up regime, that enables us to identify the sharp H\"older regularity of the singularities and to capture the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of the blow-up. We also show that the generic singularities developed in the Hunter-Saxton (HS) equation are of the same type as those in the CH equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Schr\"{o}dinger equation: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u=\lambda u+\mu|u|^{q-2}u+|u|^{2^*-2}u\quad\text{in }\mathbb{R}^N,\\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u(x)|^2dx=a,\quad u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N),\\ \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $N\ge 3$, $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}$, $a, \mu&gt;0$, $2^*=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ is the critical Sobolev exponent and $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ is one of the unknowns in the above equation which appears as a Lagrange multiplier. By applying the minimization method on the $L^2$-Pohozaev manifold, we prove that if $N\geq3$, $q\in\left(2,2+\frac{4}{N}\right)$, $a&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\mu\leq\mu^{*}_{a}$, then the above equation has two positive solutions which are real valued, radially symmetric and radially decreasing, where \begin{equation*} \mu^*_a=\frac{(2^*-2)(2-q\gamma_q)^{\frac{2-q\gamma_q}{2^*-2}}}{\gamma_q(2^*-q\gamma_q)^{\frac{2^*-q\gamma_q}{2^*-2}}}\inf_{u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N), \|u\|_{2}^2=a}\frac{\left(\|\nabla u\|_2^2\right)^\frac{2^*-q\gamma_q}{2^*-2}}{\|u\|_q^q\left(\|u\|_{2^*}^{2^*}\right)^{\frac{2-q\gamma_q}{2^*-2}}}. \end{equation*} Our results improve the conclusions of \cite{JeanjeanLe2021,JeanjeanJendrejLeVisciglia2022,Soave2020-2,WeiWu2022} and we hope that our proofs and discussions in this paper could provide new techniques and lights to understand the structure of the set of positive solutions of the above equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish that any symmetric $m$-tensor field can be recovered pointwise from partial data of the $k$-th weighted divergent ray transform for any $k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \cup\{0\}$. Using the unique continuation property of the fractional Laplacian, we further prove the unique continuation of the fractional divergent beam ray transform for both vector fields and symmetric 2-tensor fields. Additionally, we derive explicit reconstruction formulas and stability results for vector fields and symmetric 2-tensor fields in terms of fractional divergent beam ray transform data. Finally, we conclude by proving a unique continuation result for the divergent beam ray transform for functions.</description>

      <title>Regularity and existence for semilinear mixed local-nonlocal equations with variable singularities and measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proves the existence and regularity of weak solutions for a class of mixed local-nonlocal problems with singular nonlinearities. We examine both the purely singular problem and perturbed singular problems. A central contribution of this work is the inclusion of a variable singular exponent in the context of measure-valued data. Another notable feature is that the source terms in both the purely singular and perturbed components can simultaneously take the form of measures. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon is new, even in the case of a constant singular exponent.</description>

      <title>The existence of ground state solutions for critical H\'{e}non equations in $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we confirm that $2^*(\gamma)=\frac{2(N+\gamma)}{N-2}$ with $\gamma&gt;0$ is exactly the critical exponent for the embedding from $H_r^1(\mathbb{R}^N)$ into $L^q(\mathbb{R}^N;|x|^\gamma)$($N\geqslant 3$) (see \cite{2007SWW-1,2007SWW-2}) and name it as the upper H\'enon-Sobolev critical exponent. Based on this fact we study the ground state solutions of critical H\'enon equations in $\mathbb{R}^N$ via the Nehari manifold methods and the great idea of Brezis-Nirenberg in \cite{1983BN}. We establish the existence of the positive radial ground state solutions for the problem with one single upper H\'enon-Sobolev critical exponent. We also deal with the existence of the nonnegative radial ground state solutions for the problems with multiple critical exponents, including Hardy-Sobolev critical exponents or Sobolev critical exponents or the upper H\'{e}non-Sobolev critical exponents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of degenerate parabolic and elliptic equations in divergence form in the upper half space $\{x_d&gt;0\}$. The leading coefficients are of the form $x_d^2a_{ij}$, where $a_{ij}$ are measurable in $(t,x_d)$ except $a_{dd}$, which is measurable in $t$ or $x_d$. Additionally, they have small bounded mean oscillations in the other spatial variables. We obtain the well-posedness and regularity of solutions in weighted mixed-norm Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>The Schr\"odinger equation with fractional Laplacian on hyperbolic spaces and homogeneous trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dispersive and Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation involving the fractional Laplacian in real hyperbolic spaces and their discrete analogues, homogeneous trees. Due to the Knapp phenomenon, the Strichartz estimates on Euclidean spaces for the fractional Laplacian exhibit loss of derivatives. A similar phenomenon appears on real hyperbolic spaces. However, such a loss disappears on homogeneous trees, due to the triviality of the estimates for small times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider energy-minimizing harmonic maps into trees and we prove the regularity of the singular part of the free interface near triple junction points. Precisely, by a dimension reduction and a topological argument, we prove that there are no admissible frequencies between $1$ and $3/2$, and we classify the $3/2$-homogeneous solutions. Then, by proving a new epiperimetric inequality, we show that around any point of frequency $3/2$, the free interface is composed of three $C^{1,\alpha}$-smooth $(d-1)$-dimensional manifolds (of points of frequency $1$) with common $C^{1,\alpha}$-regular boundary (made of points of frequency $3/2$) that meet along this boundary at 120 degree angles, which in particular implies that the free interface is a smooth deformation of the $Y$ cone. Our results also apply to spectral optimal partition problems for the Dirichlet eigenvalues. Moreover, as a byproduct, we also prove that the $Y$-configuration is the only minimizer for the min-max optimal $3$-partition problem for the Dirichlet eigenvalues on the sphere, in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Compactness results for Sign-Changing Solutions of critical nonlinear elliptic equations of low energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded, smooth connected open domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\geq 3$. We investigate in this paper compactness properties for the set of sign-changing solutions $v \in H^1_0(\Omega)$ of
  \begin{equation} \tag{*} -\Delta v+h v =\left|v\right|^{2^*-2}v \hbox{ in } \Omega, \quad v = 0 \hbox{ on } \partial \Omega
  \end{equation}
  where $h\in C^1(\overline{\Omega})$ and $2^*:=2n/(n-2)$. Our main result establishes that the set of sign-changing solutions of $(*)$ at the lowest sign-changing energy level is unconditionally compact in $C^2(\overline{\Omega})$ when $3 \le n \le 5$, and is compact in $C^2(\overline{\Omega})$ when $n \ge 7$ provided $h$ never vanishes in $\overline{\Omega}$. In dimensions $n \ge 7$ our results apply when $h &gt;0$ in $\overline{\Omega}$ and thus complement the compactness result of Devillanova-Solimini, Adv. Diff. Eqs. 7 (2002). Our proof is based on a new, global pointwise description of blowing-up sequences of solutions of $(*)$ that holds up to the boundary. We also prove more general compactness results under perturbations of $h$.</description>

      <title>Half-Wave Maps: Explicit Formulas for Rational Functions with Simple Poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an explicit formula for the Half-Wave maps equation for rational functions with simple poles. The Lax pair provides a description of the evolution of the poles. By considering a half-spin formulation, we use linear algebra to derive a time evolution equation followed by the half-spins, in the moving frame provided by the Lax pair. We then rewrite this formula using a Toeplitz operator and $G$, the adjoint of the operator of multiplication by $x$ on the Hardy space $L_+^2(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a certain type of noisy tug-of-war game which can be regarded as an interpretation of a certain type of boundary value problem for the normalized $p$-Laplace equation, where $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. More precisely, we will investigate the boundary regularity of the value function to the game and its convergence to a viscosity solution of the model problem.</description>

      <title>Smoothing effect and quantum-classical correspondence for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation with confining potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The smoothing effect states that solutions to the Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the Euclidean space have, for almost-every time, a local-in-space improved regularity (gain of half a derivative in Sobolev spaces). In this note, we show that, for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation with a sub-quadratic confining potential, the smoothing effect is equivalent to an escape rate estimate on the associated classical flow. The proof relies on an Egorov theorem proved in~\cite{P:24Egorovinprep}.</description>

      <title>On global existence and large-time behaviour of weak solutions to the compressible barotropic Navier--Stokes Equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ with density-dependent bulk viscosity: beyond the Va\u{\i}gant--Kazhikhov regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the compressible barotropic Navier--Stokes equations for a $\gamma$-law gas with density-dependent bulk viscosity coefficient $\lambda=\lambda(\rho)=\rho^\beta$ on the two-dimensional periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^2$. The global existence of weak solutions with initial density bounded away from zero and infinity for $\beta&gt;3$, $\gamma&gt;1$ has been established by Va\u{\i}gant--Kazhikhov [Sib. Math. J. 36 (1995), 1283--1316]. When $\gamma=\beta&gt;3$, the large-time behaviour of the weak solutions and, in particular, the absence of formation of vacuum and concentration of density as $t \to \infty$, has been proved by Perepelitsa [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 39 (2007/08), 1344--1365]. Huang--Li [J. Math. Pures Appl. 106 (2016), 123--154] extended these results by establishing the global existence of weak solutions and large-time behaviour under the assumptions $\beta &gt;3/2$, $1&lt; \gamma&lt;4\beta-3$, and that the initial density stays away from infinity (but may contain vacuum).
  Improving upon the works listed above, we prove that in the regime of parameters as in Huang--Li, namely that $\beta &gt;3/2$ and $1&lt; \gamma&lt;4\beta-3$, if the density has no vacuum or concentration at $t=0$, then it stays uniformly away from zero and infinity at all later time $t \in ]0,\infty]$. Moreover, under the mere assumption that $\beta&gt;1$ and $\gamma&gt;1$, we establish the global existence of weak solutions, thus pushing the global existence theory of the barotropic Navier--Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to the most general setting to date. One of the key ingredients of our proof is a novel application -- motivated by the recent work due to Danchin--Mucha [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 76 (2023), 3437--3492] -- of Desjardins' logarithmic interpolation inequality.</description>

      <title>Sharp large time asymptotic behavior for the multi-dimensional thermoelastic systems of type II and type III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study large time asymptotic behavior of the elastic displacement $u$ and the temperature difference $\theta$ for the thermoelastic systems of type II and type III in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$ without using the thermal displacement transformation. For the type III model with hyperbolic thermal effect, we derive optimal growth/decay estimates and the novel double diffusion waves profiles for the solutions $u,\theta$ with the $L^1$ integrable initial data as large time, which improve the results in [32,26,31,17]. This hyperbolic thermal law produces a stronger singularity than the classical Fourier law in thermoelastic systems. For the type II model lacking of dissipation mechanism, we obtain optimal growth estimates and the new double waves profiles for the solutions $u,\theta$ as large time in low dimensions. Particularly, these results on the type II/III models show the infinite time blowup phenomena for $u$ if $n\leqslant 4$ and $\theta$ if $n\leqslant 2$ in the $L^2$ norm due to the hyperbolic influence. We also clarify competitions between the elastic waves effect and the hyperbolic thermal effect for the thermoelastic systems via the critical dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository note, we show that the blow-up arguments of L. Simon adapt well to the corresponding Schauder theory of germs used in the study of singular SPDEs. We illustrate this through some representative examples. As in the classical PDE framework, the argument relies only on the scaling properties of the germ semi-norms and the Liouville principle for the operator.</description>

      <title>Steady states of the spherically symmetric Vlasov-Poisson system as fixed points of a mass-preserving algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new proof for the existence of spherically symmetric steady states to the Vlasov-Poisson system, following a strategy that has been used successfully to approximate axially symmetric solutions numerically, both to the Vlasov-Poisson system and to the Einstein-Vlasov system. There are several reasons why a mathematical analysis of this numerical scheme is important. A generalization of the present result to the case of flat axially symmetric solutions would prove that the steady states obtained numerically in \cite{AR3} do exist. Moreover, in the relativistic case the question whether a steady state can be obtained by this scheme seems to be related to its dynamical stability. This motivates the desire for a deeper understanding of this strategy.</description>

      <title>Aubry Set of Eikonal Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of eikonal Hamilton-Jacobi equations posed on networks performed by Siconolfi and Sorrentino (Anal. PDE, 2018) to a more general setting. Their approach essentially exploits that such equations correspond to discrete problems on an abstract underlying graph. However, a specific condition they assume can be rather restricting in some settings, which motivates the generalization we propose. We still get an Aubry set, which plays the role of a uniqueness set for our problem and appears in the representation of solutions. Exploiting it we establish a new comparison principle between super and subsolutions to the equation.</description>

      <title>Volume Preserving Willmore Flow in a Generalized Cahn-Hilliard Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mass-preserving $L^2 $-gradient flow of a generalized Cahn-Hilliard equation and rigorously justify its sharp interface limit. For well-prepared initial data, we show that, as the interface width $\varepsilon$ approaches zero, the diffuse interface converges to a volume-preserving Willmore flow. This result is established for arbitrary spatial dimensions $n$ and applies to a general double-well potential. The proof follows the classical framework of Alikakos-Bates-Chen on Cahn-Hilliard, combining asymptotic analysis to construct approximate solutions, spectral analysis to establish coercivity, and nonlinear estimates to rigorously control the remainder terms.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity for semilinear variational problems with a topological constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of semilinear free boundary problems in which admissible functions $u$ have a topological constraint, or spanning condition, on their 1-level set. This constraint forces $\{u=1\}$, which is the free boundary, to behave like a surface with some special types of singularities attached to a fixed boundary frame, in the spirit of the Plateau problem of Harrison-Pugh. Two such free boundary problems are the minimization of capacity among surfaces sharing a common boundary and an Allen-Cahn formulation of the Plateau problem. We establish the existence of minimizers and study the regularity of solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations, obtaining the optimal Lipschitz regularity for solutions and analytic regularity for the free boundaries away from a codimension two singular set. The singularity models for these problems are given by conical critical points of the minimal capacity problem, which are closely related to spectral optimal partition and segregation problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new way to learn Physics-Informed Neural Network loss functions using Generalized Additive Models. We apply our method by meta-learning parametric partial differential equations, PDEs, on Burger's and 2D Heat Equations. The goal is to learn a new loss function for each parametric PDE using meta-learning. The derived loss function replaces the traditional data loss, allowing us to learn each parametric PDE more efficiently, improving the meta-learner's performance and convergence.</description>

      <title>Personal Sound Zones and Shielded Localized Communication through Active Acoustic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a time domain extension of our strategy on manipulating radiated scalar Helmholtz fields and discuss two important applied scenarios, namely (1) creating personal sound zones inside a bounded domain and (2) shielded localized communication. Our strategy is based on the authors' previous works establishing the possibility and stability of controlling acoustic fields using an array of almost non-radiating coupling sources and presents a detailed Fourier synthesis approach towards a time-domain effect. We require that the array of acoustic sources creates the desired fields on the control regions while maintaining a zero field beyond a larger circumscribed sphere. This paper recalls the main theoretical results then presents the underlying Fourier synthesis paradigm and show, through relevant simulations, the performance of our strategy.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new type of SPDEs, singular or with regularized noises, motivated by a study of the fluctuation of the density field in a microscopic interacting particle system. They include a large scaling parameter $N$, which is the ratio of macroscopic to microscopic size, and another scaling parameter $K=K(N)$, which controls the formation of the interface of size $K^{-1/2}$ in the density field. They are derived heuristically from the particle system, assuming the validity of the so-called ``Boltzmann-Gibbs principle", that is, a combination of the local ensemble average due to the local ergodicity and its asymptotic expansion. We study a simple situation where the interface is flat and immobile. Under making a proper stretch to the normal direction to the interface, we observe a Gaussian fluctuation of the interface. We also heuristically derive a nonlinear SPDE which describes the fluctuation of the interface.</description>

      <title>Exponential and algebraic double-soliton solutions of the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The newly discovered exponential and algebraic double-soliton solutions of the massive Thirring model in laboratory coordinates are placed in the context of the inverse scattering transform. We show that the exponential double-solitons correspond to double isolated eigenvalues in the Lax spectrum, whereas the algebraic double-solitons correspond to double embedded eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, where the continuous spectrum resides. This resolves the long-standing conjecture that multiple embedded eigenvalues may exist in the spectral problem associated with the massive Thirring model. To obtain the exponential double-solitons, we solve the Riemann--Hilbert problem with the reflectionless potential in the case of a quadruplet of double poles in each quadrant of the complex plane. To obtain the algebraic double-solitons, we consider the singular limit where the quadruplet of double poles degenerates into a symmetric pair of double embedded poles on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>On the spectral problem and fractional diffusion limit for Fokker-Planck with(-out) drift and for a general heavy tail equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a kinetic Fokker-Planck equation with general heavy-tailed equilibrium without an explicit formula, such as $C_\beta \langle v \rangle^{-\beta}$, in particular non-symmetric and non-centred. This work extends the results obtained in [Dechicha and Puel, 2023] and [Dechicha and Puel, Asymptot. Anal., 2024]. We prove that if the equilibrium behaves like $\langle v \rangle^{-\beta}$ at infinity with $\beta &gt; d$, along with an other assumption, there exists a unique eigenpair solution to the spectral problem associated with the Fokker-Planck operator, taking into account the advection term. As a direct consequence of this construction, and under the hypothesis of the convergence of the rescaled equilibrium, we obtain the fractional diffusion limit for the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation, with or without drift, depending on the decay of the equilibrium and whether or not the first moment is finite. This latter result generalizes all previous results on the fractional diffusion limit for the Fokker-Planck equation and rigorously justifies the remarks and results mentioned in [Bouin and Mouhot, PMP, 2022, Section 9].</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of effective transport for continuous uniaxial polycrystalline materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following seminal work in the early 1980s that established the existence and representations of the homogenized transport coefficients for two phase random media, we develop a mathematical framework that provides Stieltjes integral representations for the bulk transport coefficients for uniaxial polycrystalline materials, involving spectral measures of self-adjoint random operators, which are compositions of non-random and random projection operators. We demonstrate the same mathematical framework also describes two-component composites, with a simple substitution of the random projection operator, making the mathematical descriptions of these two distinct physical systems directly analogous to one another. A detailed analysis establishes the operators arising in each setting are indeed self-adjoint on an $L^2$-type Hilbert space, providing a rigorous foundation to the formal spectral theoretic framework established by Golden and Papanicolaou in 1983. An abstract extension of the Helmholtz theorem also leads to integral representations for the inverses of effective parameters, e.g., effective conductivity and resistivity. An alternate formulation of the effective parameter problem in terms of a Sobolev-type Hilbert space provides a rigorous foundation for an approach first established by Bergman and Milton. We show that the correspondence between the two formulations is a one-to-one isometry. Rigorous bounds that follow from such Stieltjes integrals and partial knowledge about the material geometry are reviewed and validated by numerical calculations of the effective parameters for polycrystalline media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant measure for the associated weakly ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the so-called $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>On a countable sequence of homoclinic orbits arising near a saddle-center point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponential small splitting of separatrices in the singular perturbation theory leads generally to nonvanishing oscillations near a saddle--center point and to nonexistence of a true homoclinic orbit. It was conjectured long ago that the oscillations may vanish at a countable set of small parameter values if there exist a quadruplet of singularities in the complex analytic extension of the limiting homoclinic orbit. The present paper gives a rigorous proof of this conjecture for a particular fourth-order equation relevant to the traveling wave reduction of the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation with the fifth-order dispersion term.</description>

Abstract: The Nelson model describes non-relativistic particles coupled to a relativistic Bose scalar field. In this article, we study the renormalized version of the Nelson model with massless bosons in Davies' weak coupling limit. Our main result states that the two-body Coulomb potential emerges as an effective pair interaction between the particles, which arises from the exchange of virtual excitations of the quantum field.</description>

      <title>Direct linearisation of the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and a `lifted' modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation are directly linearisable, and thus integrable in this sense. There are several versions of the non-commutative mKP equations, including the two-dimensional generalisations of the non-commutative modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and its alternative form (amKdV). Herein we derive the `lifted' mKP equation, whose solutions are the natural two-dimensional extension of those for the non-commutative mKdV equation derived in Blower and Malham. We also present the log-potential form of the mKP equation, from which all of these non-commutative mKP equations can be derived. To achieve the integrability results, we construct the pre-Poppe algebra that underlies the KP and mKP equations. This is a non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real line generated by the solution (and its partial derivatives) to the linearised form of the KP and mKP equations. The algebra is endowed with a pre-Poppe product, based on the product rule for semi-additive operators pioneered by Poppe for the commutative KP equation. Integrability corresponds to establishing a particular polynomial expansion in the respective pre-Poppe algebra. We also present numerical simulations of soliton-like interactions for the non-commutative KP equation.</description>

Abstract: We study the long time behaviour of solutions for the weakly damped forced Kawahara equation on the torus. More precisely, we prove the existence of a global attractor in $L^2$, to which as time passes all solutions draw closer. In fact, we show that the global attractor turns out to lie in a smoother space $H^2$ and be bounded therein. Further, we give an upper bound of the size of the attractor in $H^2$ that depends only on the damping parameter and the norm of the forcing term.</description>

      <title>Fractional diffusion for Fokker-Planck equation with heavy tail equilibrium: an \`a la Koch spectral method in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the spectral method developed [Dechicha and Puel, 2023] to any dimension $d\geqslant 1$, in order to construct an eigen-solution for the Fokker-Planck operator with heavy tail equilibria, of the form $(1+|v|^2)^{-\frac{\beta}{2}}$, in the range $\beta \in ]d,d+4[$. The method developed in dimension 1 was inspired by the work of H. Koch on nonlinear KdV equation [Koch, Nonlinearity, 2015]. The strategy in this paper is the same as in dimension 1 but the tools are different, since dimension 1 was based on ODE methods. As a direct consequence of our construction, we obtain the fractional diffusion limit for the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation, for the correct density $\rho := \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} f \mathrm{d}v$, with a fractional Laplacian $\kappa(-\Delta_x)^{\frac{\beta-d+2}{6}}$ and a positive diffusion coefficient $\kappa$.</description>

In particular, we show that $G$-compactness can be obtained under severely weaker assumptions than in the original work of Burazin and Vrdoljak (2014). In this way we extend the applicability of $G$-compactness results for Friedrichs systems to equations that yield memory effects in the homogenised limit and detour any usage of compactness techniques previously employed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we construct global in time classical solutions to mean field games master equations in the lack of idiosyncratic noise in the individual agents' dynamics. These include both deterministic models and dynamics driven solely by a Brownian common noise. We consider a general class of non-separable Hamiltonians and final data functions that are supposed to be displacement monotone. Our main results unify and generalize in particular some of the well-posedness results on displacement monotone master equations obtained recently by Gangbo--M\'esz\'aros and Gangbo--M\'esz\'aros--Mou--Zhang.</description>

      <title>Microlocal Analysis of Waves Across the Event Horizon of an Extremal Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static black holes contain regions of spacetime which not even light can escape from. In the centre of mass frame, these blocks are separated from each other by event horizons. Unlike pointlike particles, fields can spread and interact non-causally across the horizons. The microlocal theory of this is somewhat incomplete, however. For instance, the theory of real principal type operators does not apply on the horizon. In this article, we address this issue for the extremal rotating black hole. Namely, we show that null covectors on the horizon of the extremal Kerr spacetime form an involutive double characteristic manifold and then extend the construction of parametrix across the event horizon. This provides a mathematical basis for the asymptotic oscillatory solutions in the region. Such approximations are central in quantum mechanics. In contrast to the real principal case, solutions near the horizon admit two channels for propagation of singularities. Indeed, there is additional propagation along the double characteristic variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove propagation of $\frac{1}{s}$-Gevrey regularity $(s \in (0, 1))$ and analyticity $(s=1)$ for the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system on $\mathbb{T}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d$ (and $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}^d$) using a Fourier space method in analogy to the results proved for the Euler system in [Kukavica and Vicol, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 2009] and [Levermore and Oliver, JDE, 1997] and for Vlasov-Poisson system in [Velozo Ruiz, Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'e C Anal. Non Lin\'eaire, 2021]. More precisely, we give quantitative estimates for the growth of the $\frac{1}{s}$-Gevrey norm and decay of the regularity radius for the solution of the system in terms of $\nabla_x u$, the spatial density $\rho_f$ and the diameter of the support in the velocity variable of the distribution of particles $f$. In particular, this implies existence of $\frac{1}{s}$-Gevrey $(s \in (0, 1))$ and analytic $(s = 1)$ solutions for the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{T}^d\times\mathbb{R}^d$ (and $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}^d$), and global Gevrey solutions in $\mathbb{T}^3\times\mathbb{R}^3$ for sufficiently small data, and an initial data for the Vlasov equation with compact support in velocity.</description>

Abstract: We propose a thresholding algorithm to Willmore-type flows in $\mathbb{R}^N$. This algorithm is constructed based on the asymptotic expansion of the solution to the initial value problem for a fourth order linear parabolic partial differential equation whose initial data is the indicator function on the compact set $\Omega_0$. The main results of this paper demonstrate that the boundary $\partial\Omega(t)$ of the new set $\Omega(t)$, generated by our algorithm, is included in $O(t)$-neighborhood of $\partial\Omega_0$ for small $t&gt;0$ and that the normal velocity from $ \partial\Omega_0 $ to $ \partial\Omega(t) $ is nearly equal to the $L^2$-gradient of Willmore-type energy for small $ t&gt;0 $. Finally, numerical examples of planar curves governed by the Willmore flow are provided by using our thresholding algorithm.</description>

      <title>Periodic space-time homogenisation of the $\phi^4_2$ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the homogenisation problem for the $\phi^4_2$ equation on the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, namely the behaviour as $\varepsilon \to 0$ of the solutions to the equation suggestively written as $$ \partial_t u_\varepsilon - \nabla\cdot {A}(x/\varepsilon,t/\varepsilon^2) \nabla u_\varepsilon = -u^3_\varepsilon +\xi $$ where $\xi$ denotes space-time white noise and $A: \mathbb{T}^2\times \mathbb{R}$ is uniformly elliptic, periodic and H\"older continuous. When the noise is regularised at scale $\delta \ll 1$ we show that any joint limit $\varepsilon,\delta \to 0$ recovers the classical dynamical $\phi^4_2$ model. In certain regimes or if the regularisation is chosen in a specific way adapted to the problem, we show that the counterterms can be chosen as explicit local functions of $A$.</description>

      <title>From transient elastic linkages to friction: a complete study of a penalized fourth order equation with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a fourth order nonlinear parabolic delayed problem modelling a quasi-instantaneous turn-over of linkages in the context of cell-motility. The model depends on a small parameter $\epsilon$ which represents a typical time scale of the memory effect. We first prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions for $\epsilon$ fixed. This is achieved by combining suitable fixed-point and energy arguments and by uncovering a nonlocal in time, integral conserved quantity. After giving a complete classification of steady states in terms of elliptic functions, we next show that every solution converges to a steady state as $t \to \infty$. When $\epsilon \to 0$, we then establish convergence results on finite time intervals, showing that the solution tends in a suitable sense towards the solution of a parabolic problem without delay. Moreover, we establish the convergence of energies as $\epsilon \to 0$, which enables us to show that, for $\epsilon$ small enough, the $\epsilon$-dependent problem inherits part of the large time asymptotics of the limiting parabolic problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence and uniqueness of fundamental solution operators to Kolmo\-gorov-Fokker-Planck equations with rough (measurable) coefficients and local or integral diffusion on finite and infinite time strips. In the local case, that is to say when the diffusion operator is of differential type, we prove $\L^2$ decay using Davies' method and the conservation property. We also prove that the existence of a generalized fundamental solution with the expected pointwise Gaussian upper bound is equivalent to Moser's $\L^2-\L^\infty$ estimates for local weak solutions to the equation and its adjoint.  When coefficients are real, this gives the existence and uniqueness of such a generalized fundamental solution and a new and natural way to obtain pointwise decay.</description>

      <title>On smooth and peaked traveling waves in a local model for shallow water waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new model equation for Stokes gravity waves based on conformal transformations of Euler's equations. The local version of the model equation is relevant for dynamics of shallow water waves. It allows us to characterize the traveling periodic waves both in the case of smooth and peaked waves and to solve the existence problem exactly, albeit not in elementary functions. Spectral stability of smooth waves with respect to co-periodic perturbations is proven analytically based on the exact count of eigenvalues in a constrained spectral problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral estimates on hyperbolic surfaces and a necessary condition for observability of the heat semigroup on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is a continuation of arXiv:2401.14977. We study the concentration properties of spectral projectors on manifolds, in connection with the uncertainty principle. In arXiv:2401.14977, the second author proved an optimal uncertainty principle for the spectral projector of the Laplacian on the hyperbolic half-plane. The aim of the present work is to generalize this condition to surfaces with hyperbolic ends. In particular, we tackle the case of cusps, in which the volume of balls of fixed radius is not bounded from below. We establish that spectral estimates hold from sets satisfying a thickness condition, with a proof based on propagation of smallness estimates of Carleman and Logunov--Malinnikova type. We also prove the converse, namely the necessary character of the thickness condition, on any smooth manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish Trudinger-type inequality in the context of fractional boundary Hardy-type inequality for the case $sp=d$, where $p&gt;1, ~ s \in (0,1)$ on a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we establish fractional version of Trudinger-type inequality with an extra singular function, namely $d$-th power of the distance function from $\partial \Omega$ in the denominator of the integrand. The case $d=1$, as it falls in the category $sp=1$, becomes more delicate where an extra logarithmic correction is required together with subtraction of an average term.</description>

      <title>Observability inequality, log-type Hausdorff content and heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies observability inequalities for heat equations on both bounded domains and the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$. The observation sets are measured by log-type Hausdorff contents, which are induced by certain log-type gauge functions closely related to the heat kernel. On a bounded domain, we derive the observability inequality for observation sets of positive log-type Hausdorff content. Notably, the aforementioned inequality holds not only for all sets with Hausdorff dimension $s$ for any $s\in (d-1,d]$, but also for certain sets of Hausdorff dimension $d-1$. On the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we establish the observability inequality for observation sets that are thick at the scale of the log-type Hausdorff content. Furthermore, we prove that for the 1-dimensional heat equation on an interval, the Hausdorff content we have chosen is an optimal scale for the observability inequality.
  To obtain these observability inequalities, we use the adapted Lebeau-Robiano strategy from \cite{Duyckaerts2012resolvent}. For this purpose, we prove the following results at scale of the log-type Hausdorff content, the former being derived from the latter: We establish a spectral inequality/a Logvinenko-Sereda uncertainty principle; we set up a quantitative propagation of smallness of analytic functions; we build up a Remez' inequality; and more fundamentally, we provide an upper bound for the log-type Hausdorff content of a set where a monic polynomial is small, based on an estimate in Lubinsky \cite{Lubinsky1997small}, which is ultimately traced back to the classical Cartan Lemma. In addition, we set up a capacity-based slicing lemma (related to the log-type gauge functions) and establish a quantitative relationship between Hausdorff contents and capacities. These tools are crucial in the studies of the aforementioned propagation of smallness in high-dimensional situations.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Heat Generation Using Plasmonics: A Parabolic Transmission Problem Driven by the Maxwell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The excitation of plasmonic nanoparticles by incident electromagnetic waves at frequencies near their subwavelength resonances induces localized heat generation in the surrounding medium. We develop a mathematical framework to rigorously quantify this heat generation in systems of arbitrarily distributed nanoparticles. 1. For an arbitrary discrete distribution of M nanoparticles within a bounded domain, the effective heat distribution is described by a coupled system: Volterra-type integral equations for the heat conduction and a Foldy-Lax-type system governing the self consistent electric field intensities. These equations are parameterized by the particle geometries and the local electromagnetic field interactions. The effective heat generation is computed by solving these coupled systems, with the computational complexity scaling as M^2. 2. In the case M &gt;&gt; 1, under natural scaling regimes, the discrete system converges to a continuum model, yielding an effective parabolic equation for the heat distribution. The source term in this homogenized parabolic model is characterized by the solution of the homogenized Maxwells equations, incorporating an effective permittivity distribution derived from the Drude model under resonance conditions. Our analysis utilizes advanced tools in potential theory, asymptotic analysis and homogenization. By leveraging layer potential representations, we derive point-wise field approximations. The coupling between the Maxwell and heat equations is resolved by analyzing the spectral properties of the nanoparticles and their scaling limits. This framework reduces the problem to two mathematical challenges: a control problem for the effective parabolic system and an internal phase-less inverse problem for the Maxwell system, thus providing a unified approach to modeling heat generation in nanoparticle clusters.</description>

      <title>Log-Concavity and Fundamental Gaps on Surfaces of Positive Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the log-concavity of the first Dirichlet eigenfunction of the Laplacian for convex domains. For positively curved surfaces satisfying a condition involving the curvature and its second derivatives, we show that the first eigenfunction is strongly log-concave. Previously, for general convex domains, the log-concavity of the first eigenfunctions were only known when lying in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$. Using this estimate, we establish lower bounds on the fundamental gap of such regions. Furthermore, we study the behavior of these estimates under Ricci flow and other deformations of the metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the linear orbital stability of spectrally stable stationary discrete shock profiles for conservative finite difference schemes applied to systems of conservation laws. The proof relies on an accurate description of the pointwise asymptotic behavior of the Green's function associated with those discrete shock profiles, improving on the result of Lafitte-Godillon [God03]. The main novelty of this stability result is that it applies to a fairly large family of schemes that introduce some artificial possibly high-order viscosity. The result is obtained under a sharp spectral assumption rather than by imposing a smallness assumption on the shock amplitude.</description>

      <title>Loop group factorization method for the magnetic and thermostatic nonabelian ray transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the injectivity of the matrix attenuated and nonabelian ray transforms on compact surfaces with boundary for nontrapping $\lambda$-geodesic flows and the general linear group of invertible complex matrices. We generalize the loop group factorization argument of Paternain and Salo to reduce to the setting of the unitary group when $\lambda$ has the vertical Fourier degree at most $2$. This covers the magnetic and thermostatic flows as special cases. Our article settles the general injectivity question of the nonabelian ray transform for simple magnetic flows in combination with an earlier result by Ainsworth. We stress that the injectivity question in the unitary case for simple Gaussian thermostats remains open. Furthermore, we observe that the loop group argument does not apply when $\lambda$ has higher Fourier modes.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Constraint-Relaxation in PDE-Based Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Many of these are naturally formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. These non-linear, large-scale, constrained optimization problems know many challenges, of which the inherent non-linearity of the problem is an important one. In this paper, we focus on a relaxed formulation of the PDE-constrained optimization problem and provide an in-depth analysis of it. Starting from an infinite-dimensional formulation of the inverse problem with discrete data, we propose a general framework for the analysis and discretisation of such problems. The relaxed formulation of the PDE-constrained optimization problem is shown to reduce to a weighted non-linear least-squares problem. The weight matrix turns out to be the Gram matrix of solutions of the PDE and, in some cases, can be estimated directly from the measurements. The latter observation points to a potential way to unify recently proposed data-driven reduced-order models for inverse problems with PDE-constrained optimization. We provide a number of representative case studies and numerical examples to illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Closed-form solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with arbitrary dispersion and potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is investigated, in which the chromatic dispersion and potential are specified by two arbitrary functions. The equation in question is a natural generalization of a wide class of related nonlinear partial differential equations that are often used in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity and plasma physics. To construct exact solutions, a combination of the method of functional constraints and methods of generalized separation of variables is used. Exact closed-form solutions of the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions, are found. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the considered nonlinear partial differential equation to a simpler ordinary differential equation or a system of such equations. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics.</description>
