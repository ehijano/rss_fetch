      <title>Learning Simulatable Models of Cloth with Spatially-varying Constitutive Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing, padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework, called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations. Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy, and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>BANG: Dividing 3D Assets via Generative Exploded Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to deconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However, current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart of BANG is "Generative Exploded Dynamics", which creates a smooth sequence of exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while preserving their geometric and semantic coherence.
  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling 2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.
  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry, associating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating component-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG offers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for easy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation from imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on creation that resonates with human intuition.</description>

      <title>VizGenie: Toward Self-Refining, Domain-Aware Workflows for Next-Generation Scientific Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks. By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility, VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific visualization.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of Social Media Platforms Impact on the Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms offer numerous benefits and allow people to come together for various causes. Many communities, academia, government agencies, institutions, healthcare, entertainment, and businesses are on social media platforms. They are intuitive and free for users. It has become unimaginable to live without social media. Their architecture and data handling are geared towards scalability, uninterrupted availability, and both personal and collaborative revenue generation. Primarily, artificial intelligence algorithms are employed on stored user data for optimization and feeds. This has the potential to impact user safety, privacy, and security, even when metadata is used. A new decentralized data arrangement framework based on the Fractal-tree and L-Systems algorithm is proposed to mitigate some of the impacts of social media platforms.
  Future work will focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the new decentralized framework by comparing its results against state-of-the-art security methods currently used in databases. A cryptographic algorithm could also be implemented for the framework, employing a new key generation for each branch. This will strengthen database security; for example, if a user key is leaked, regenerating the key for each branch will keep the data secure by applying defense mechanisms in the proposed L-System-based tree framework.</description>

      <title>VoluMe -- Authentic 3D Video Calls from Live Gaussian Splat Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware, making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed, where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically, via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but also realistic and authentic.</description>

      <title>InSituTale: Enhancing Augmented Data Storytelling with Physical Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented data storytelling enhances narrative delivery by integrating visualizations with physical environments and presenter actions. Existing systems predominantly rely on body gestures or speech to control visualizations, leaving interactions with physical objects largely underexplored. We introduce augmented physical data storytelling, an approach enabling presenters to manipulate visualizations through physical object interactions. To inform this approach, we first conducted a survey of data-driven presentations to identify common visualization commands. We then conducted workshops with nine HCI/VIS researchers to collect mappings between physical manipulations and these commands. Guided by these insights, we developed InSituTale, a prototype that combines object tracking via a depth camera with Vision-LLM for detecting real-world events. Through physical manipulations, presenters can dynamically execute various visualization commands, delivering cohesive data storytelling experiences that blend physical and digital elements. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated that InSituTale enables intuitive interactions, offers high utility, and facilitates an engaging presentation experience.</description>

      <title>Solving Boundary Handling Analytically in Two Dimensions for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytic approach for evaluating boundary integrals in two dimensions for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Conventional methods often rely on boundary particles or wall re-normalization approaches derived from applying the divergence theorem, whereas our method directly evaluates the area integrals for SPH kernels and gradients over triangular boundaries. This direct integration strategy inherently accommodates higher-order boundary conditions, such as piecewise cubic fields defined via Finite Element stencils, enabling analytic and flexible coupling with mesh-based solvers. At the core of our approach is a general solution for compact polynomials of arbitrary degree over triangles by decomposing the boundary elements into elementary integrals that can be solved with closed-form solutions. We provide a complete, closed-form solution for these generalized integrals, derived by relating the angular components to Chebyshev polynomials and solving the resulting radial integral via a numerically stable evaluation of the Gaussian hypergeometric function $_2F_1$. Our solution is robust and adaptable and works regardless of triangle geometries and kernel functions. We validate the accuracy against high-precision numerical quadrature rules, as well as in problems with known exact solutions. We provide an open-source implementation of our general solution using differentiable programming to facilitate the adoption of our approach to SPH and other contexts that require analytic integration over polygonal domains. Our analytic solution outperforms existing numerical quadrature rules for this problem by up to five orders of magnitude, for integrals and their gradients, while providing a flexible framework to couple arbitrary triangular meshes analytically to Lagrangian schemes, building a strong foundation for addressing several grand challenges in SPH and beyond.</description>

      <title>V2M4: 4D Mesh Animation Reconstruction from a Single Monocular Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present V2M4, a novel 4D reconstruction method that directly generates a usable 4D mesh animation asset from a single monocular video. Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Fast Globally Optimal and Geometrically Consistent 3D Shape Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometric consistency, i.e. the preservation of neighbourhoods, is a natural and strong prior in 3D shape matching. Geometrically consistent matchings are crucial for many downstream applications, such as texture transfer or statistical shape modelling. Yet, in practice, geometric consistency is often overlooked, or only achieved under severely limiting assumptions (e.g. a good initialisation). In this work, we propose a novel formalism for computing globally optimal and geometrically consistent matchings between 3D shapes which is scalable in practice. Our key idea is to represent the surface of the source shape as a collection of cyclic paths, which are then consistently matched to the target shape. Mathematically, we construct a hyper product graph (between source and target shape), and then cast 3D shape matching as a minimum-cost circulation flow problem in this hyper graph, which yields global geometrically consistent matchings between both shapes. We empirically show that our formalism is efficiently solvable and that it leads to high-quality results.</description>

      <title>TiVy: Time Series Visual Summary for Scalable Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios.</description>

      <title>Geometric Algebra Meets Large Language Models: Instruction-Based Transformations of Separate Meshes in 3D, Interactive and Controllable Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) to revolutionize controllable 3D scene editing, particularly for object repositioning tasks, which traditionally requires intricate manual processes and specialized expertise. These conventional methods typically suffer from reliance on large training datasets or lack a formalized language for precise edits. Utilizing CGA as a robust formal language, our system, Shenlong, precisely models spatial transformations necessary for accurate object repositioning. Leveraging the zero-shot learning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, Shenlong translates natural language instructions into CGA operations which are then applied to the scene, facilitating exact spatial transformations within 3D scenes without the need for specialized pre-training. Implemented in a realistic simulation environment, Shenlong ensures compatibility with existing graphics pipelines. To accurately assess the impact of CGA, we benchmark against robust Euclidean Space baselines, evaluating both latency and accuracy. Comparative performance evaluations indicate that Shenlong significantly reduces LLM response times by 16% and boosts success rates by 9.6% on average compared to the traditional methods. Notably, Shenlong achieves a 100% perfect success rate in common practical queries, a benchmark where other systems fall short. These advancements underscore Shenlong's potential to democratize 3D scene editing, enhancing accessibility and fostering innovation across sectors such as education, digital entertainment, and virtual reality.</description>

      <title>Efficient Nearest Neighbor Search Using Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15023v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a collection of points in R^3, KD-Tree and R-Tree are well-known nearest neighbor search (NNS) algorithms that rely on space partitioning and spatial indexing techniques. However, when the query point is far from the data points or the data points inherently represent a 2-manifold surface, their query performance may degrade. To address this, we propose a novel dynamic programming technique that precomputes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to encode the proximity structure between data points. More specifically, the DAG captures how the proximity structure evolves during the incremental construction of the Voronoi diagram of the data points. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a 1x-10x speedup. Additionally, our algorithm demonstrates significant practical value across diverse applications. We validated its effectiveness through extensive testing in four key applications: Point to Mesh Distance Queries, Iterative Closest Point (ICP) Registration, Density Peak Clustering, and Point to Segments Distance Queries. A particularly notable feature of our approach is its unique ability to efficiently identify the nearest neighbor among the first k points in the point cloud a capability that enables substantial acceleration in low-dimensional applications like Density Peak Clustering. As a natural extension of our incremental construction process, our method can also be readily adapted for farthest point sampling tasks. These experimental results across multiple domains underscore the broad applicability and practical importance of our approach.</description>

      <title>Puzzle Similarity: A Perceptually-guided Cross-Reference Metric for Artifact Detection in 3D Scene Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

      <title>GALE: Leveraging Heterogeneous Systems for Efficient Unstructured Mesh Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unstructured meshes present challenges in scientific data analysis due to irregular distribution and complex connectivity. Computing and storing connectivity information is a major bottleneck for visualization algorithms, affecting both time and memory performance. Recent task-parallel data structures address this by precomputing connectivity information at runtime while the analysis algorithm executes, effectively hiding computation costs and improving performance. However, existing approaches are CPU-bound, forcing the data structure and analysis algorithm to compete for the same computational resources, limiting potential speedups. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel task-parallel approach optimized for heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems. Specifically, we offload the computation of mesh connectivity information to GPU threads, enabling CPU threads to focus on executing the visualization algorithm. Following this paradigm, we propose GALE (GPU-Aided Localized data structurE), the first open-source CUDA-based data structure designed for heterogeneous task parallelism. Experiments on two 20-core CPUs and an NVIDIA V100 GPU show that GALE achieves up to 2.7x speedup over state-of-the-art localized data structures while maintaining memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>Signed Higher-Order Interactions for Brain Disorder Diagnosis via Multi-Channel Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing higher-order interactions of brain regions and extracting interpretable organizational patterns from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data is crucial for brain disease diagnosis. Current graph-based deep learning models primarily focus on pairwise or triadic patterns while neglecting signed higher-order interactions, limiting comprehensive understanding of brain-wide communication. We propose HOI-Brain, a novel computational framework leveraging signed higher-order interactions and organizational patterns in fMRI data for brain disease diagnosis. First, we introduce a co-fluctuation measure based on Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives to detect higher-order interactions with temporal resolution. We then distinguish positive and negative synergistic interactions, encoding them in signed weighted simplicial complexes to reveal brain communication insights. Using Persistent Homology theory, we apply two filtration processes to these complexes to extract signed higher-dimensional neural organizations spatiotemporally. Finally, we propose a multi-channel brain Transformer to integrate heterogeneous topological features. Experiments on Alzheimer' s disease, Parkinson' s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder datasets demonstrate our framework' s superiority, effectiveness, and interpretability. The identified key brain regions and higher-order patterns align with neuroscience literature, providing meaningful biological insights.</description>
