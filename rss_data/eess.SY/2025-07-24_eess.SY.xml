      <title>Stable and Fair Benefit Allocation in Mixed-Energy Truck Platooning: A Coalitional Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the benefit allocation in a mixed-energy truck platoon composed of fuel-powered and electric trucks. The interactions among trucks during platoon formation are modeled as a coalitional game with transferable utility. We first design a stable payoff allocation scheme that accounts for truck heterogeneity in energy savings and platoon roles (leader or follower), establishing core-stability conditions to ensure that no subset of trucks has an incentive to deviate for greater benefit. To enhance payoff fairness, we then propose a closed-form, Shapley value-based allocation approach that is computationally efficient and independent of the platoon size. Sufficient conditions under which the allocation is both fair and core-stable are provided. In scenarios where the Shapley value falls outside the core, we develop an alternative allocation based on the stable payoff that minimizes the mean relative deviation from the Shapley value while preserving core stability. This deviation is further proved to be upper-bounded by $1$, showing a favorable trade-off between stability and fairness. Finally, extensive numerical studies validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in facilitating stable, equitable, and sustainable cooperation in mixed-energy truck platooning.</description>

      <title>Fast Distribution Grid Topology Estimation via Subset Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faced with increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and fast development of distribution grid energy management, topology identification of distribution grid becomes an important and fundamental task. As the underlying grid topology is usually unknown or incomplete to the utilities, it is becoming a fundamental task to efficiently identify the distribution grid network topology using limited measurements. A fast and accurate topology identification can help achieving the tasks of load monitoring, operation and control of power distribution system as well as outage detection. In this paper, we propose a novel and ultra-fast topology identification method. By adapting the subset sum method with a hierarchical structure, the overall grid topology can be inferred from fewer samples of smart meter power measurements. Such techniques can be applied in real time under the scenarios with fast topology change, and the proposed hierarchical algorithm is also robust against measurement noises.</description>

      <title>Impact of Communication Delay and Sampling on Small-Signal Stability of IBR-rich Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of inverter-based resources (IBRs) has introduced unprecedented dynamics in power systems, resulting in oscillations across a broad spectrum of frequencies. Communication delay between the plant-level control and the inverter-level control in IBR plants has been recognized as one of the causes of such oscillations and a factor that impacts the system's stability. The control signals from the plant-level controller also experience sampling, with the sampled values held constant by the hold elements for the duration of the sampling period. This also has a bearing on the response of IBR plants. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of communication delay and sampling of control signals between plant-level control and inverter-level control of grid-following IBR plants on the small-signal stability of power systems. The underlying fundamentals of communication delay and sampling are revisited to explain the observed responses. Our findings emphasize the unique effects of communication delay and sampling period on the stability of IBR-rich power systems and suggest strategies to mitigate their detrimental impacts. The work also highlights the need for more accurate approaches for small-signal stability analysis of such systems.</description>

      <title>Extension of Simple and Accurate Inductance Estimation for Rectangular Planar Windings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to generalize the equations estimating the inductance of square-shape planar windings to rectangle shape. This is done by utilizing the optimal p-norm of the Generalized Mean Value or Power Mean (PM). Three well-established equations with verified accuracy are examined, namely Wheeler, Rosa, and the Monomial, which by definition consider only regular polygons. One critical parameter of the original equations is the outer-side length of the winding, which for the rectangle case, can be substituted by the PM of the two outer-side lengths, without the need for any further modifications. A methodology to select the optimal p-norm for the PM is presented in terms of achieving the best accuracy for this estimation. The selection of the optimal p is based on results from datasets containing more than 2600 simulations of different rectangle-shaped windings. Finally, the estimation accuracy is verified by laboratory measurements for a selection of planar inductors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Energy-Autonomous Wireless Sensing Node (EAWSN) that addresses power constraints by harnessing ambient light for energy. It combines this energy harvesting capability with the Time Domain to Digital Conversion (TDDC) technique for efficient and accurate measurements of resistive sensors. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication ensures data can be transmitted wirelessly to a base station, providing a promising solution for various applications, particularly in environments with limited access to wired power sources, enabling long-term, maintenance-free operation by eliminating batteries. Experimental results showed a linear relationship between the test resistance R_m and the measured number of clock pulses N_m within the sensor's operating range.</description>

      <title>Transient Stability-Driven Planning for the Optimal Sizing of Resilient AC/DC Hybrid Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a transient stability-driven planning framework for the optimal sizing problem of resilient AC/DC hybrid microgrids (HMGs) under different types of contingencies, capturing frequency and voltage stability requirements as well as the frequency-voltage coupling dynamics of AC/DC interlinking converters (ICs). The planning model is formulated into a defender-attacker-defender (DAD) architecture, which can be further merged into two levels, i.e., upper-level and low-level problems, and then iteratively solved by an enhanced genetic algorithm with sparsity calculation and local search. Regarding the operation stage, a novel transient stability-constrained optimal power flow (TSC-OPF) algorithm is proposed for static and transient operations of HMGs, capturing governor dynamics and automatic voltage regulator of conventional generators as well as the droop control dynamics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) for frequency control and voltage control, respectively. Furthermore, a Lyapunov optimisation approach is developed to capture the time-coupling property of energy storages (ESs) and then allow the TSC-OPF to be solved on an hourly basis with a second-scale resolution, achieving the co-optimisation of static and transient stability requirements. Case studies have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed planning framework in obtaining cost-effective investment decisions for various resources while respecting transient stability requirements under different contingencies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Angle Rotational Actuation in a 0.8-mm-Thick Preload-Free Piezoelectric Micromotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro motors can be used in numerous fields like Micro medical testing and treatment. To achieve a smaller size, micro piezoelectric motors in laboratories often omit the outer casing, which can lead to functional defects such as rotation only in one fixed direction or the need for external weights (which are not counted within the motors volume) to increase preload. However, this significantly reduces the practical value of micro piezoelectric motors. This paper proposes a new driving principle for piezoelectric motors to design a micro piezoelectric motor that can rotate at a wide range of angles (e.g. up to 80)without increasing the motors casing and does not require external weights, with a stator thickness of only 0.8 mm. This motor has significant application potential in OCT endoscopes and thrombectomy grinding heads</description>

      <title>Maintenance-free condition monitoring system based on lora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rising volume of railroad transportation, the traditional track inspection mainly relies on manual inspection and large-scale inspection equipment, which not only has low inspection frequency and lagging response, but also has the defects of high risk, high cost and easy to miss inspection. To this end, this study designs and realizes a maintenance-free railroad track wireless monitoring system based on LoRa module LM401. Each monitoring node consists of an STM32 microcontroller, an LM401 LoRa transceiver, a low-power ADXL362 triaxial acceleration sensor, a digital temperature sensor (LMT85), and a digital barometric pressure sensor (RSCM17100KP101). The system collects vibration data through the SPI1 interface at the node end, periodically reads the temperature and barometric pressure information, and packages and sends the data to a centralized gateway within a range of 500 m using the LoRa star topology; the gateway then uploads the data in real time to a cloud server through a 4G module, which supports the MQTT protocol. MQTT protocol is supported. Laboratory tests and field deployments show that the system can realize acceleration resolution of 0.01 g, reduce maintenance cost by about 70%, and improve monitoring efficiency by more than 5 times. The system provides a reliable means for intelligent rail health management, and in the future, it is planned to introduce RF energy collection technology to realize automatic wake-up without battery, and expand to urban bridges, tunnels and environmental monitoring and other multi-scenario applications.</description>

      <title>Ontological Definition of Seamless Digital Engineering Based on ISO/IEC 25000-Series SQuaRE Product Quality Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the introduction of Digital Engineering (DE) as a well-defined concept in 2018, organizations and industry groups have been working to interpret the DE concepts to establish consistent meta-models of those interrelated concepts for integration into their DE processes and tools. To reach the breadth and depth of DE concept definitions, the interpretation of international standard sources is necessary, including ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, 24765, 42000-series, 15408, 15206, 27000-series, and 25000-series, to effectively model the knowledge domain where digital engineering applies. The harmonization of the concepts used in these international standards continues to improve with each revision, but it may be more effectively accomplished by relying on the descriptive logic formalized in the Web Ontology Language (OWL 2 DL). This paper presents a verified and consistent ontology based on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies (CCO) that defines Seamless Digital Engineering as a digital tooling paradigm that relies on formal verification of digital interfaces to provide a system-level qualification of the assured integrity of a Digital Engineering Environment. The present work defines classes and equivalence axioms, while using only the BFO- and CCO-defined object properties that relate them, to provide a baseline analysis that may inform future DE-related ontology development, using a case study to formally define the `seamless' quality in relation to the updated ISO 25010 SQuaRE product quality model. We identified ISO meta-model inconsistencies that are resolvable using the BFO/CCO ontological framework, and define `seamless' as both a system integration quality and a Human-Computer Interface quality-in-use, working to disambiguate this concept in the context of DE.</description>

      <title>Dispatch-Aware Deep Neural Network for Optimal Transmission Switching: Toward Real-Time and Feasibility Guaranteed Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN produces a provably feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.</description>

      <title>On the Construction of Barrier Certificate: A Dynamic Programming Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the formal verification problem for stochastic dynamical systems over finite horizon using barrier certificates. Most existing work on this topic focuses on safety properties by constructing barrier certificates based on the notion of $c$-martingales. In this work, we first provide a new insight into the conditions of existing martingale-based barrier certificates from the perspective of dynamic programming operators. Specifically, we show that the existing conditions essentially provide a bound on the dynamic programming solution, which exactly characterizes the safety probability. Based on this new perspective, we demonstrate that the barrier conditions in existing approaches are unnecessarily conservative over unsafe states. To address this, we propose a new set of safety barrier certificate conditions that are strictly less conservative than existing ones, thereby providing tighter probability bounds for safety verification. We further extend our approach to the case of reach-avoid specifications by providing a set of new barrier certificate conditions. We also illustrate how to search for these new barrier certificates using sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. Finally, we use two numerical examples to demonstrate the advantages of our method compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Integrating Grid impedance estimation method into Advanced Angle Estimation Kalman Filter in GFL inverter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of power electronic converter-interfaced distributed energy resources into modern power systems presents significant challenges for system monitoring, protection, and control. Grid impedance plays a critical role in the operation and stability assessment of grid-connected inverter systems. This study presents a real-time grid impedance estimation method based on the Discrete Fourier Transform. The proposed method is integrated with the Advanced Angle Estimation Kalman Filter using a Linear Quadratic Regulator current controller (AAEKF-LQR), assisting the use of impedance information for accurate instantaneous phase angle estimation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed impedance estimation method interacts effectively with the AAEKF-LQR controller, maintaining stable system performance under weak grid conditions. The approach also demonstrates the ability to deliver fast and accurate impedance estimation during operational variations in grid conditions, thereby supporting stable inverter operation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Car Resequencing on Mixed-Model Assembly Lines: Algorithm Development and Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixed-model assembly line (MMAL) is a production system used in the automobile industry to manufacture different car models on the same conveyor, offering a high degree of product customization and flexibility. However, the MMAL also poses challenges, such as finding optimal sequences of models satisfying multiple constraints and objectives related to production performance, quality, and delivery -- including minimizing the number of color changeovers in the Paint Shop, balancing the workload and setup times on the assembly line, and meeting customer demand and delivery deadlines. We propose a multi-objective algorithm to solve the MMAL resequencing problem under consideration of all these aspects simultaneously. We also present empirical results obtained from recorded event data of the production process over $4$ weeks following the deployment of our algorithm in the Saarlouis plant of Ford-Werke GmbH. We achieved an improvement of the average batch size of about $30\%$ over the old control software translating to a $23\%$ reduction of color changeovers. Moreover, we reduced the spread of cars planned for a specific date by $10\%$, reducing the risk of delays in delivery. We discuss effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm in improving production performance and quality as well as trade-offs and limitations.</description>

      <title>Output Feedback Design for Parameter Varying Systems subject to Persistent Disturbances and Control Rate Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a technique for designing output feedback controllers for constrained linear parameter-varying systems that are subject to persistent disturbances. Specifically, we develop an incremental parameter-varying output feedback control law to address control rate constraints, as well as state and control amplitude constraints. The proposal is based on the concept of robust positively invariant sets and applies the extended Farkas' lemma to derive a set of algebraic conditions that define both the control gains and a robust positively invariant polyhedron that satisfies the control and state constraints. These algebraic conditions are formulated into a bilinear optimization problem aimed at determining the output feedback gains and the associated polyedral robust positively invariant region. The obtained controller ensures that any closed-loop trajectory originating from the polyhedron converges to another smaller inner polyhedral set around the origin in finite time, where the trajectory remains ultimately bounded regardless of the persistent disturbances and variations in system parameters. Furthermore, by including the sizes of the two polyhedral sets inside the objective function, the proposed optimization can also jointly enlarge the outer set while minimizing the inner one. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal in managing the specified constraints, disturbances, and parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Integrating Physics-Based and Data-Driven Approaches for Probabilistic Building Energy Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building energy modeling is a key tool for optimizing the performance of building energy systems. Historically, a wide spectrum of methods has been explored -- ranging from conventional physics-based models to purely data-driven techniques. Recently, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both paradigms have gained attention. These include strategies such as learning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between simulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world measurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs for data-driven models, and integrating the physics-based output into the loss function the data-driven model. Despite this progress, two significant research gaps remain. First, most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling, often neglecting the inherent uncertainties caused by factors like weather fluctuations and occupant behavior. Second, there has been little systematic comparison within a probabilistic modeling framework. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating five representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy modeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a real-world case study. Our results highlight two main findings. First, the performance of hybrid approaches varies across different building room types, but residual learning with a Feedforward Neural Network performs best on average. Notably, the residual approach is the only model that produces physically intuitive predictions when applied to out-of-distribution test data. Second, Quantile Conformal Prediction is an effective procedure for calibrating quantile predictions in case of indoor temperature modeling.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for Unlocking Energy Flexibility of Heat Pump and Thermal Energy Storage Systems: Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and electrification of energy systems necessitates the engagement of demand-side management (DSM) to help alleviate congestion in electricity grid. Heat pump and thermal energy storage (HPTES) systems, being energy efficient solutions, are becoming popular in modern buildings and are promising to contribute to demand-side management (DSM) due to their significant share in household electricity consumption. For typical HPTES systems, this paper presents a systematic design framework covering a control-oriented modeling process and energy-flexible model predictive control (MPC) design. The proposed MPC-based DSM strategy offers an innovative solution for efficient DSM by following a two-step DSM framework. In the first step, flexibility assessment is performed to quantitatively evaluate the flexibility potential of the HPTES system by solving a mixed-integer economic MPC problem. In the second step, flexibility exploitation is achieved through reacting to feasible demand response (DR) requests while respecting system constraints. Both numerical simulations and real-world experiments are performed based on a real HPTES installation to showcase the viability and effectiveness of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>A Joint Planning Model for Fixed and Mobile Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Considering Flexible Capacity Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has significantly increased demand on both transportation and power systems, posing challenges to their stable operation. To support the growing need for EV charging, both fixed charging stations (FCSs) and mobile charging stations (MCSs) have been introduced, serving as key interfaces between the power grid and traffic network. Recognizing the importance of collaborative planning across these sectors, this paper presents a two-stage joint planning model for FCSs and MCSs, utilizing an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The primary goal of the proposed model is to transform the potential negative impacts of large-scale EV integration into positive outcomes, thereby enhancing social welfare through collaboration among multiple stakeholders. In the first stage, we develop a framework for evaluating FCS locations, incorporating assessments of EV hosting capacity and voltage stability. The second stage introduces a joint planning model for FCSs and MCSs, aiming to minimize the overall social costs of the EV charging system while maintaining a reliable power supply. To solve the planning problem, we employ a combination of mixed-integer linear programming, queueing theory, and sequential quadratic programming. The improved ADMM algorithm couples the siting and sizing decisions consistently by introducing coupling constraints, and supports a distributed optimization framework that coordinates the interests of EV users, MCS operators, and distribution system operators. Additionally, a flexible capacity planning strategy that accounts for the multi-period development potential of EVCS is proposed to reduce both the complexity and the investment required for FCS construction. Finally, a case study with comparative experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed models and solution methods.</description>

      <title>Toward Federated DeePC: borrowing data from similar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven predictive control approaches, in general, and Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC), in particular, exploit matrices of raw input/output trajectories for control design. These data are typically gathered only from the system to be controlled. Nonetheless, the increasing connectivity and inherent similarity of (mass-produced) systems have the potential to generate a considerable amount of information that can be exploited to undertake a control task. In light of this, we propose a preliminary federated extension of DeePC that leverages a combination of input/output trajectories from multiple similar systems for predictive control. Supported by a suite of numerical examples, our analysis unveils the potential benefits of exploiting information from similar systems and its possible downsides.</description>

      <title>Learning clusters of partially observed linear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning clusters of partially observed linear dynamical systems from multiple input-output trajectories. This setting is particularly relevant when there are limited observations (e.g., short trajectories) from individual data sources, making direct estimation challenging. In such cases, incorporating data from multiple related sources can improve learning. We propose an estimation algorithm that leverages different data requirements for the tasks of clustering and system identification. First, short impulse responses are estimated from individual trajectories and clustered. Then, refined models for each cluster are jointly estimated using multiple trajectories. We establish end-to-end finite sample guarantees for estimating Markov parameters and state space realizations and highlight trade-offs among the number of observed systems, the trajectory lengths, and the complexity of the underlying models.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Control Barrier Functions for Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for the simultaneous synthesis of a barrier certificate and a safe controller for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. Our approach, based on piecewise stochastic control barrier functions, reduces the synthesis problem to a minimax optimization, which we solve exactly using a dual linear program with zero gap. This enables the joint optimization of the barrier certificate and safe controller within a single formulation. The method accommodates stochastic dynamics with additive noise and a bounded continuous control set. The synthesized controllers and barrier certificates provide a formally guaranteed lower bound on probabilistic safety. Case studies on linear and nonlinear stochastic systems validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Sensor Drift Compensation in Electronic-Nose-Based Gas Recognition Using Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to environmental changes and sensor aging, sensor drift challenges the performance of electronic nose systems in gas classification during real-world deployment. Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset reported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical experimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing class-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift compensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation tasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to predict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and predicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous training data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three methods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark method Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method KD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed that KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18% improvement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior effectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for electronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift compensation in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>ZORMS-LfD: Learning from Demonstrations with Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Zeroth-Order Random Matrix Search for Learning from Demonstrations (ZORMS-LfD). ZORMS-LfD enables the costs, constraints, and dynamics of constrained optimal control problems, in both continuous and discrete time, to be learned from expert demonstrations without requiring smoothness of the learning-loss landscape. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art first-order methods require the existence and computation of gradients of the costs, constraints, dynamics, and learning loss with respect to states, controls and/or parameters. Most existing methods are also tailored to discrete time, with constrained problems in continuous time receiving only cursory attention. We demonstrate that ZORMS-LfD matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of both learning loss and compute time across a variety of benchmark problems. On unconstrained continuous-time benchmark problems, ZORMS-LfD achieves similar loss performance to state-of-the-art first-order methods with an over $80$\% reduction in compute time. On constrained continuous-time benchmark problems where there is no specialized state-of-the-art method, ZORMS-LfD is shown to outperform the commonly used gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimization method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for identifying and simulating financial and economic systems using stochastically structured reservoir computers (SSRCs). The proposed framework leverages structure-preserving embeddings and graph-informed coupling matrices to model inter-agent dynamics with enhanced interpretability. A constrained optimization scheme ensures that the learned models satisfy both stochastic and structural constraints. Two empirical case studies, a dynamic behavioral model of resource competition among agents, and regional inflation network dynamics, illustrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing and anticipating complex nonlinear patterns and enabling interpretable predictive analysis under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Design of a Noval Wearable ECG Monitoring Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this project is to develop a new wireless powered wearable ECG monitoring device. The main goal of the project is to provide a wireless, small-sized ECG monitoring device that can be worn for a long period of time by the monitored person. Electrocardiogram ECG reflects physiological and pathological information about heart activity and is commonly used to diagnose heart disease. Existing wearable smart ECG solutions suffer from high power consumption in both ECG diagnosis and transmission for high accuracy. Monitoring of ECG devices is mainly done by data extraction and acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, processing and analysis, visualisation and auxiliary procedures. During the pre-processing of the information, different kinds of noise generated during the signal collection need to be taken into account. The quality of the signal-to-noise ratio can usually be improved by optimising algorithms and reducing the noise power. The choice of electrodes usually has a direct impact on the signal-to-noise ratio and the user experience, and conventional Ag/AgCl gel electrodes are not suitable for long-term and dynamic monitoring as they are prone to skin irritation, inflammation and allergic reactions. Therefore, a completely new way of combining electrodes and wires will be used in the report. The electrodes and wires are cut in one piece from a silver-plated fabric. The wire portion is cut into a curved structure close to an S shape to ensure that it has good ductility for comfort and signal integrity during daily movement of the garment.</description>

Abstract: Flexibility provision from active distribution grids requires efficient and robust methods of optimization and control suitable to online operation. In this paper we introduce conditions for the safe operation of feedback optimization based controllers. We use the feasible operating region of a controlled system as bounds for safe system states and evaluate the trajectories of the controller based on the projection of the full system state onto the two-dimensional PQ-plane. We demonstrate the defined conditions for an exemplary sub-transmission system. We show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate controller performance and robustness for systems subject to disturbances.</description>

      <title>System Level Synthesis for Affine Control Policies: Model Based and Data-Driven Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an increasing need for effective control of systems with complex dynamics, particularly through data-driven approaches. System Level Synthesis (SLS) has emerged as a powerful framework that facilitates the control of large-scale systems while accounting for model uncertainties. SLS approaches are currently limited to linear systems and time-varying linear control policies, thus limiting the class of achievable control strategies. We introduce a novel closed-loop parameterization for time-varying affine control policies, extending the SLS framework to a broader class of systems and policies. We show that the closed-loop behavior under affine policies can be equivalently characterized using past system trajectories, enabling a fully data-driven formulation. This parameterization seamlessly integrates affine policies into optimal control problems, allowing for a closed-loop formulation of general Model Predictive Control (MPC) problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend SLS to affine policies in both model-based and data-driven settings, enabling an equivalent formulation of MPC problems using closed-loop maps. We validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that our model-based and data-driven affine SLS formulations achieve performance on par with traditional model-based MPC.</description>

      <title>First, Learn What You Don't Know: Active Information Gathering for Driving at the Limits of Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining data-driven models that adapt online and model predictive control (MPC) has enabled effective control of nonlinear systems. However, when deployed on unstable systems, online adaptation may not be fast enough to ensure reliable simultaneous learning and control. For example, a controller on a vehicle executing highly dynamic maneuvers--such as drifting to avoid an obstacle--may push the vehicle's tires to their friction limits, destabilizing the vehicle and allowing modeling errors to quickly compound and cause a loss of control. To address this challenge, we present an active information gathering framework for identifying vehicle dynamics as quickly as possible. We propose an expressive vehicle dynamics model that leverages Bayesian last-layer meta-learning to enable rapid online adaptation. The model's uncertainty estimates are used to guide informative data collection and quickly improve the model prior to deployment. Dynamic drifting experiments on a Toyota Supra show that (i) the framework enables reliable control of a vehicle at the edge of stability, (ii) online adaptation alone may not suffice for zero-shot control and can lead to undesirable transient errors or spin-outs, and (iii) active data collection helps achieve reliable performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers. Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.</description>

      <title>How to Adapt Control Barrier Functions? A Learning-Based Approach with Applications to a VTOL Quadplane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for online adaptation of Control Barrier Function (CBF) parameters, i.e., of the class K functions included in the CBF condition, under input constraints. We introduce the concept of locally validated CBF parameters, which are adapted online to guarantee finite-horizon safety, based on conditions derived from Nagumo's theorem and tangent cone analysis. To identify these parameters online, we integrate a learning-based approach with an uncertainty-aware verification process that account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties inherent in neural network predictions. Our method is demonstrated on a VTOL quadplane model during challenging transition and landing maneuvers, showcasing enhanced performance while maintaining safety.</description>

      <title>Robot Operation of Home Appliances by Reading User Manuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household, is a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a robot system that operates novel household appliances by "reading" their user manuals. ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial policies from their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual document, (ii) ground the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and (iii) execute the policies reliably over potentially many steps, despite compounding errors. To tackle these challenges, ApBot constructs a structured, symbolic model of an appliance from its manual, with the help of a large vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic actions visually to control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating the model based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range of simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and statistically significant improvements in task success rate, compared with state-of-the-art large VLMs used directly as control policies. These results suggest that a structured internal representations plays an important role in robust robot operation of home appliances, especially, complex ones.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Exploration for a Class of Continuous-Time Indefinite Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent. We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>Active Probing with Multimodal Predictions for Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09822v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges.

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Green Hydrogen Yield Prediction and Site Suitability using SHAP-Based Composite Index: Focus on Oman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As nations seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, green hydrogen has emerged as a promising strategic pathway toward decarbonisation, particularly in solar-rich arid regions. However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen production requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and infrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct hydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework consists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering, supervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm. The pipeline trains on an integrated meteorological, topographic and temporal dataset and the results revealed distinct spatial patterns of suitability and relative influence of the variables. With model predictive accuracy of 98%, the result also showed that water proximity, elevation and seasonal variation are the most influential factors determining green hydrogen site suitability in Oman with mean absolute shap values of 2.470891, 2.376296 and 1.273216 respectively. Given limited or absence of ground-truth yield data in many countries that have green hydrogen prospects and ambitions, this study offers an objective and reproducible alternative to subjective expert weightings, thus allowing the data to speak for itself and potentially discover novel latent groupings without pre-imposed assumptions. This study offers industry stakeholders and policymakers a replicable and scalable tool for green hydrogen infrastructure planning and other decision making in data-scarce regions.</description>

      <title>Constrained Control Allocation With Continuous-Time Rate Constraints: Three-Dimensional Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel quadratic programming (QP) approach for constrained control allocation that directly incorporates continuous-time actuator rate constraints without requiring slack variables. Over-actuated aircraft configurations, particularly prevalent in eVTOL and military applications, require control allocation algorithms to distribute commanded control moments among available actuators while respecting position and rate constraints. Existing methods such as direct allocation, pseudo-inverse, cascaded generalized inverse, and exact redistributed pseudo-inverse either cannot handle rate constraints in continuous time or require discretization approaches that compromise performance. Current QP methods that incorporate rate constraints rely on slack variables to ensure feasibility, which prevents full utilization of the attainable moment set and degrades allocation performance. The proposed methodology addresses this limitation by calculating the attainable moment set from both position and rate constraints through convex hull operations, then ensuring feasibility by scaling unattainable commanded moments to the boundary of the attainable moment set while preserving their direction. This approach guarantees the feasibility of the optimization problem without slack variables. The method is validated through simulation on an F-18 fighter aircraft control allocation problem, demonstrating equivalent performance to the established exact redistributed pseudo-inverse method while providing smoother actuator behavior and enhanced constraint satisfaction. Results show that incorporating continuous-time rate constraints leads to improved actuator tracking, reduced overshoot, and more precise adherence to position limits, which is essential for aircraft safety, ride comfort, and actuator longevity.</description>
