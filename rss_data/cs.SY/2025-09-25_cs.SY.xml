      <title>Automatic and Scalable Safety Verification using Interval Reachability with Subspace Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interval refinement is a technique for reducing the conservatism of traditional interval based reachability methods by lifting the system to a higher dimension using new auxiliary variables and exploiting the introduced structure through a refinement procedure. We present a novel, efficiently scaling, automatic refinement strategy based on a subspace sampling argument and motivated by reducing the number of interval operations through sparsity. Unlike previous methods, we guarantee that refined bounds shrink as additional auxiliary variables are added. This additionally encourages automation of the lifting phase by allowing larger groups of auxiliary variables to be considered. We implement our strategy in JAX, a high-performance computational toolkit for Python and demonstrate its efficacy on several examples, including regulating a multi-agent platoon to the origin while avoiding an obstacle.</description>

      <title>Robust Near-Optimal Nonlinear Target Enclosing Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a nonlinear optimal guidance law that enables a pursuer to enclose a target within arbitrary geometric patterns, which extends beyond conventional circular encirclement. The design operates using only relative state measurements and formulates a target enclosing guidance law in which the vehicle's lateral acceleration serves as the steering control, making it well-suited for aerial vehicles with turning constraints. Our approach generalizes and extends existing guidance strategies that are limited to target encirclement and provides a degree of optimality. At the same time, the exact information of the target's maneuver is unnecessary during the design. The guidance law is developed within the framework of a state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE), thereby providing a systematic way to handle nonlinear dynamics through a pseudo-linear representation to design locally optimal feedback guidance commands through state-dependent weighting matrices. While SDRE ensures near-optimal performance in the absence of strong disturbances, we further augment the design to incorporate an integral sliding mode manifold to compensate when disturbances push the system away from the nominal trajectory, and demonstrate that the design provides flexibility in the sense that the (possibly time-varying) stand-off curvature could also be treated as unknown. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>linrax: A JAX Compatible, Simplex Method Linear Program Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present linrax, the first simplex based linear program (LP) solver compatible with the JAX ecosystem. In many control algorithms, LPs are often automatically generated and frequently solved either offline or online in the control loop. This motivates the design of linrax, which is especially suited for compilation into a complex JAX-based pipeline as a subroutine. We discuss the challenges associated with implementing a general purpose LP solver under strict design requirements from JAX. Notably, we can solve general problems which may include dependent constraints-something not possible with existing JAX-compatible LP solvers that use first-order techniques and may fail to converge. We demonstrate the utility of linrax through several examples, including a robust control synthesis pipeline for a nonlinear vehicle model using automatic differentiation through a LP-based reachable set framework.</description>

      <title>Four-Transistor Bipolar Series-Parallel Module Structure for Cascaded Bridge and Modular Multilevel Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With their great scalability and flexibility, cascaded-bridge and modular multilevel converters have enabled a variety of energy applications, such as offshore wind power, high-voltage dc power transmission, power-quality management, and cutting-edge medical instrumentation. The incorporation of parallel connectivity between modules equips systems with advantages such as sensorless balancing, switched-capacitor energy exchange, and reduced impedance. However, existing topologies require many individual switches -- eight transistors per module. Efforts to use fewer switches, instead, have previously compromised their functionality. We propose a new module topology, named the direction-selective parallel (DiSeP) structure, which requires only four transistors per module -- the same as an H bridge -- but can achieve bidirectional equilibration, bipolar module output, and inter-module switched-capacitor features.
  This topology is highly attractive for existing converters with cascaded bridge elements, as the addition of only four diodes enables key features such as sensorless balancing and inter-module energy exchange. Thus, the module can outcompete H bridges in their applications, as it adds parallel modes without any additional transistors. Compared to double-H bridges (CH2B), it saves as many as half of the transistors.
  We elaborate on its working principles and key design considerations. We validate our theories on an experimental prototype with six modules. This prototype attains a total voltage harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) of 10.3% and a peak efficiency of 96.3%. Furthermore, the modules achieve autonomous sensorless balancing under open-loop control.</description>

      <title>Federated Aggregation of Demand Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a federated framework for demand flexibility aggregation to support grid operations. Unlike existing geometric methods that rely on a static, pre-defined base set as the geometric template for aggregation, our framework establishes a true federated process by enabling the collaborative optimization of this base set without requiring the participants sharing sensitive data with the aggregator. Specifically, we first formulate the base set optimization problem as a bilevel program. Using optimal solution functions, we then reformulate the bilevel program into a single-level, unconstrained learning task. By exploiting the decomposable structure of the overall gradient, we further design a decentralized gradient-based algorithm to solve this learning task. The entire framework, encompassing base set optimization, aggregation, and disaggregation, operates by design without exchanging raw user data. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework unlocks substantially more flexibility than the approaches with static base sets, thus providing a promising framework for efficient and privacy-enhanced approaches to coordinate demand flexibility at scale.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Formation Control: from Geometry to Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and develop the concept of dispersion formation control, bridging a gap between shape-assembly studies in physics and biology and formation control theory. In current formation control studies, the control objectives typically focus on achieving desired local geometric properties, such as inter-agent distances, bearings, or relative positions. In contrast, our dispersion formation control approach enables agents to directly regulate the dispersion of their spatial distribution, a global variable associated with a covariance matrix. Specifically, we introduce the notion of covariance similarity to define the target spatial dispersion of agents. Building on this framework, we propose two control strategies: a centralized approach to illustrate the key ideas, and a distributed approach that enables agents to control the global dispersion but using only local information. Our stability analysis demonstrates that both strategies ensure exponential convergence of the agents' distribution to the desired dispersion. Notably, controlling a global variable rather than multiple local ones enhances the resiliency of the system, particularly against malfunctioning agents. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed dispersion formation control.</description>

      <title>Zonotope-Based Elastic Tube Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a widely adopted robust control framework for constrained linear systems under additive disturbance. The paper is focused on reducing the numerical complexity associated with the tube parameterization, described as a sequence of elastically-scaled zonotopic sets. A new class of scaled-zonotope inclusion conditions is proposed, alleviating the need for a priori specification of certain set-containment constraints and achieving significant reductions in complexity. A comprehensive complexity analysis is provided for both the polyhedral and the zonotopic setting, illustrating the trade-off between an enlarged domain of attraction and the required computational effort. The proposed approach is validated through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>An early termination strategy for the distributed biased min-consensus protocol under disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distributed biased min-consensus (DBMC) protocol is an iterative scheme that solves the shortest path problem asymptotically, requiring only local information exchange between neighboring nodes. By appropriately designing the gain function, prior work [1] proposed a DBMC-based system that ensures convergence within a pre-specified time interval. However, this guarantee assumes the absence of disturbances. In this paper, we study the DBMC-based system under disturbances affecting the edge weights. We first establish rigorous error bounds on the resulting state estimates. Building on this analysis, we then propose a practical early termination strategy to prevent potential singularities, specifically, unbounded gain, that may arise in the presence of disturbances, while still ensuring that the shortest paths are correctly identified.Simulations are performed to validate and illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>CollaPipe: Adaptive Segment-Optimized Pipeline Parallelism for Collaborative LLM Training in Heterogeneous Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for intelligent mobile applications has made multi-agent collaboration with Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) essential in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. However, training LLMs in such environments remains challenging due to heavy computation, high end-to-end latency, and limited model generalization. We introduce CollaPipe, a hybrid distributed learning framework that integrates collaborative pipeline parallelism with federated aggregation to support self-evolving intelligent networks. In CollaPipe, the encoder part is adaptively partitioned into variable-sized segments and deployed across mobile devices for pipeline-parallel training, while the decoder is deployed on edge servers to handle generative tasks. Then we perform global model update via federated aggregation. To enhance training efficiency, we formulate a joint optimization problem that adaptively allocates model segments, micro-batches, bandwidth, and transmission power. We derive and use a closed-form convergence bound to design an Dynamic Segment Scheduling and Resource Allocation (DSSDA) algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization, ensuring system stability under long-term constraints. Extensive experiments on downstream tasks with Transformer and BERT models show that CollaPipe improves computation efficiency by up to 15.09%, reduces end-to-end latency by at least 48.98%, and cuts single device memory usage by more than half, enabling online learning in heterogeneous and dynamic communication environments.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Approximation-free Symbolic Control for Unknown Euler-Lagrange Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel symbolic control framework for enforcing temporal logic specifications in Euler-Lagrange systems that addresses the key limitations of traditional abstraction-based approaches. Unlike existing methods that require exact system models and provide guarantees only at discrete sampling instants, our approach relies only on bounds on system parameters and input constraints, and ensures correctness for the full continuous-time trajectory. The framework combines scalable abstraction of a simplified virtual system with a closed-form, model-free controller that guarantees trajectories satisfy the original specification while respecting input bounds and remaining robust to unknown but bounded disturbances. We provide feasibility conditions for the construction of confinement regions and analyze the trade-off between efficiency and conservatism. Case studies on pendulum dynamics, a two-link manipulator, and multi-agent systems, including hardware experiments, demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures both correctness and safety while significantly reducing computational time and memory requirements. These results highlight its scalability and practicality for real-world robotic systems where precise models are unavailable and continuous-time guarantees are essential.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Control of Deep Sign-Definite Dynamics with Application to Hybrid Powertrain Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is increasingly used for complex, large-scale systems where first-principles modeling is difficult. However, standard deep learning models often fail to enforce physical structure or preserve convexity in downstream control, leading to physically inconsistent predictions and discontinuous inputs owing to nonconvexity. We introduce sign constraints--sign restrictions on Jacobian entries--that unify monotonicity, positivity, and sign-definiteness; additionally, we develop model-construction methods that enforce them, together with a control-synthesis procedure. In particular, we design exactly linearizable deep models satisfying these constraints and formulate model predictive control as a convex quadratic program, which yields a unique optimizer and a Lipschitz continuous control law. On a two-tank system and a hybrid powertrain, the proposed approach improves prediction accuracy and produces smoother control inputs than existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the control and navigation of a simulated two-dimensional electric rocket. The model provides a simplified framework that neglects actuator dynamics and aerodynamic effects while capturing the complexities of underactuation and state coupling. Trajectory tracking is achieved through a modularized and layered control architecture, with employement of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Lyapunov theory. Full-state estimation is achieved through Kalman filtering techniques, part of the navigation module. The solutions are thoroughly evaluated in a custom-built MATLAB/Simulink testbed, simulating real-world conditions while maintaining a simplified setup. The results reveal limitations along the lateral axis, whose resolution is suggested for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed Koopman operator learning framework for modeling unknown nonlinear dynamics using sequential observations from multiple agents. Each agent estimates a local Koopman approximation based on lifted data and collaborates over a communication graph to reach exponential consensus on a consistent distributed approximation. The approach supports distributed computation under asynchronous and resource-constrained sensing. Its performance is demonstrated through simulation results, validating convergence and predictive accuracy under sensing-constrained scenarios and limited communication.</description>

      <title>Certified Learning-Enabled Noise-Aware Motion Planning for Urban Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate urban congestion and transportation challenges. Nevertheless, the noise generated by eVTOL aircrafts poses a significant barrier to public acceptance and regulatory approval, potentially limiting the operational scope and scalability of UAM systems. Hence, the successful adoption of UAM systems hinges on the ability to predict generated noise levels, and further develop motion planning strategies that comply with community-level noise regulations while maintaining operational efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a novel noise-aware motion planning framework for UAM systems that ensures compliance with noise regulations. We first develop a certifiable neural network model to accurately predict eVTOL noise propagation patterns in urban environments, providing provable bounds on its correctness. To achieve a desired level of accuracy, we propose an active sampling strategy to efficiently build the dataset used to train and test the noise model. Next, we develop a noise-aware motion planning algorithm that utilizes the noise model to generate eVTOL trajectories that guarantee compliance with community noise regulations. The algorithm exploits the monotonic structure of the noise model to efficiently sample the configuration space, ensuring that the generated trajectories are both noise-compliant and operationally efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through a number of experiments for Vahana eVTOLs. The results show that the framework can generate noise-compliant flight plans for a fleet of eVTOLs that adhere to community noise regulations while optimizing operational efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus over networked agents is typically studied using undirected or directed communication graphs. Undirected graphs enforce symmetry in information exchange, leading to convergence to the average of initial states, while directed graphs permit asymmetry but make consensus dependent on root nodes and their influence. Both paradigms impose inherent restrictions on achievable consensus values and network robustness. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for achieving consensus over a class of network topologies, termed pseudo-undirected graphs, which retains bidirectional connectivity between node pairs but allows the corresponding edge weights to differ, including the possibility of negative values under bounded conditions. The resulting Laplacian is generally non-symmetric, yet it guarantees consensus under connectivity assumptions, to expand the solution space, which enables the system to achieve a stable consensus value that can lie outside the convex hull of the initial state set. We derive admissibility bounds for negative weights for a pseudo-undirected path graph, and show an application in the simultaneous interception of a moving target.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Pursuits in Cislunar Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cislunar space is becoming a critical domain for future lunar and interplanetary missions, yet its remoteness, sparse infrastructure, and unstable dynamics create single points of failure. Adversaries in cislunar orbits can exploit these vulnerabilities to pursue and jam co-located communication relays, potentially severing communications between lunar missions and the Earth. We study a pursuit-evasion scenario between two spacecraft in a cislunar orbit, where the evader must avoid a pursuer-jammer while remaining close to its nominal trajectory. We model the evader-pursuer interaction as a zero-sum adversarial differential game cast in the circular restricted three-body problem. This formulation incorporates critical aspects of cislunar orbital dynamics, including autonomous adjustment of the reference orbit phasing to enable aggressive evading maneuvers, and shaping of the evader's cost with the orbit's stable and unstable manifolds. We solve the resulting nonlinear game locally using a continuous-time differential dynamic programming variant, which iteratively applies linear-quadratic approximations to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation. We simulate the evader's behavior against both a worst-case and a linear-quadratic pursuer. Our results pave the way for securing future missions in cislunar space against emerging cyber threats.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Event-Triggered Policy Gradient for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods rely on time-triggered execution, where agents sample and communicate actions at fixed intervals. This approach is often computationally expensive and communication-intensive. To address this limitation, we propose ET-MAPG (Event-Triggered Multi-Agent Policy Gradient reinforcement learning), a framework that jointly learns an agent's control policy and its event-triggering policy. Unlike prior work that decouples these mechanisms, ET-MAPG integrates them into a unified learning process, enabling agents to learn not only what action to take but also when to execute it. For scenarios with inter-agent communication, we introduce AET-MAPG, an attention-based variant that leverages a self-attention mechanism to learn selective communication patterns. AET-MAPG empowers agents to determine not only when to trigger an action but also with whom to communicate and what information to exchange, thereby optimizing coordination. Both methods can be integrated with any policy gradient MARL algorithm. Extensive experiments across diverse MARL benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art, time-triggered baselines while significantly reducing both computational load and communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Approximately Optimal Toll Design for Efficiency and Equity in Arc-Based Traffic Assignment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Congestion pricing policies have emerged as promising traffic management tools to alleviate traffic congestion caused by travelers' selfish routing behaviors. The core principle behind deploying tolls is to impose monetary costs on frequently overcrowded routes, to incentivize self-interested travelers to select less easily congested routes. Recent literature has focused on toll design based on arc-based traffic assignment models (TAMs), which characterize commuters as traveling through a traffic network by successively selecting an outgoing arc from every intermediate node along their journey. However, existing tolling mechanisms predicated on arc-based TAMs often target the design of a single congestion-minimizing toll, ignoring crucial fairness considerations, such as the financial impact of high congestion fees on low-income travelers. To address these shortcomings, in this paper, we pose the dual considerations of efficiency and equity in traffic routing as bilevel optimization problems. Since such problems are in general computationally intractable to solve precisely, we construct a linear program approximation by introducing a polytope approximation for the set of all tolls that induce congestion-minimizing traffic flow patterns. Finally, we provide numerical results that validate our theoretical conclusions.</description>

      <title>Qompiler: A Traceable Quantum Circuit Synthesizer for Arbitrary Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum compiler framework that bridges the gap between physics modeling and quantum software development. At the core of this framework is a versatile quantum circuit synthesizer capable of decomposing arbitrary Hamiltonians into quantum circuits, represented using a platform-independent B-Tree-based intermediate representation. The B-Tree structure encodes information for gate lineage, enabling detailed tracing information of quantum circuit gates and facilitating circuit verification. The intermediate representation serves as a universal, hardware-agnostic carrier of compiled code, allowing it to be readily rendered on most quantum hardware backends and transpiled into other quantum circuit languages. We demonstrate rendering the intermediate representation into executable quantum circuits in Qiskit and Cirq. We can also transpile the intermediate representation into OpenQASM for broader compatibility.</description>

      <title>Crater Observing Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator (COBRA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA aims to establish a sustainable human basecamp on the Moon as a stepping stone for future missions to Mars and beyond. The discovery of water ice on the Moon's craters located in permanently shadowed regions, which can provide drinking water, oxygen, and rocket fuel, is therefore of critical importance. However, current methods to access lunar ice deposits are limited. While rovers have been used to explore the lunar surface for decades, they face significant challenges in navigating harsh terrains, such as permanently shadowed craters, due to the high risk of immobilization. This report introduces COBRA (Crater Observing Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator), a multi-modal snake-style robot designed to overcome mobility challenges in Shackleton Crater's rugged environment. COBRA combines slithering and tumbling locomotion to adapt to various crater terrains. In snake mode, it uses sidewinding to traverse flat or low inclined surfaces, while in tumbling mode, it forms a circular barrel by linking its head and tail, enabling rapid movement with minimal energy on steep slopes. Equipped with an onboard computer, stereo camera, inertial measurement unit, and joint encoders, COBRA facilitates real-time data collection and autonomous operation. This paper highlights COBRAs robustness and efficiency in navigating extreme terrains through both simulations and experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Metriplectic Conditional Flow Matching for Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.</description>

      <title>From Space to Time: Enabling Adaptive Safety with Learned Value Functions via Disturbance Recasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical environments such as urban air mobility hinges on ensuring reliable, performant, and safe operation under varying environmental conditions. One such approach, value function-based safety filters, minimally modifies a nominal controller to ensure safety. Recent advances leverage offline learned value functions to scale these safety filters to high-dimensional systems. However, these methods assume detailed priors on all possible sources of model mismatch, in the form of disturbances in the environment -- information that is rarely available in real world settings. Even in well-mapped environments like urban canyons or industrial sites, drones encounter complex, spatially-varying disturbances arising from payload-drone interaction, turbulent airflow, and other environmental factors. We introduce SPACE2TIME, which enables safe and adaptive deployment of offline-learned safety filters under unknown, spatially-varying disturbances. The key idea is to reparameterize spatial variations in disturbance as temporal variations, enabling the use of precomputed value functions during online operation. We validate SPACE2TIME on a quadcopter through extensive simulations and hardware experiments, demonstrating significant improvement over baselines.</description>

      <title>Modular Machine Learning with Applications to Genetic Circuit Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules' input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.</description>

      <title>Minimalistic Autonomous Stack for High-Speed Time-Trial Racing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing has seen significant advancements, driven by competitions such as the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) and the Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League (A2RL). However, developing an autonomous racing stack for a full-scale car is often constrained by limited access to dedicated test tracks, restricting opportunities for real-world validation. While previous work typically requires extended development cycles and significant track time, this paper introduces a minimalistic autonomous racing stack for high-speed time-trial racing that emphasizes rapid deployment and efficient system integration with minimal on-track testing. The proposed stack was validated on real speedways, achieving a top speed of 206 km/h within just 11 hours' practice run on the track with 325 km in total. Additionally, we present the system performance analysis, including tracking accuracy, vehicle dynamics, and safety considerations, offering insights for teams seeking to rapidly develop and deploy an autonomous racing stack with limited track access.</description>

      <title>SoK: A Systematic Review of Malware Ontologies and Taxonomies and Implications for the Quantum Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The threat of quantum malware is real and a growing security concern that will have catastrophic scientific and technological impacts, if not addressed early. If weaponised or exploited especially by the wrong hands, malware will undermine highly sophisticated critical systems supported by next-generation quantum architectures, for example, in defence, communications, energy, and space. This paper explores the fundamental nature and implications of quantum malware to enable the future development of appropriate mitigations and defences, thereby protecting critical infrastructure. By conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) that draws on knowledge frameworks such as ontologies and taxonomies to explore malware, this provides insights into how malicious behaviours can be translated into attacks on quantum technologies, thereby providing a lens to analyse the severity of malware against quantum technologies. This study employs the European Competency Framework for Quantum Technologies (CFQT) as a guide to map malware behaviour to several competency layers, creating a foundation in this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Formal Safety Verification and Refinement for Generative Motion Planners via Certified Local Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware (differential-drive robot).</description>

      <title>Voltage-sensitive distribution factors for contingency analysis and topology optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology optimization is a promising approach for mitigating congestion and managing changing grid conditions, but it is computationally challenging and requires approximations. Conventional distribution factors like PTDFs and LODFs, based on DC power flow, fail to capture voltage variations, reactive power, and losses - limiting their use in detailed optimization tasks such as busbar splitting. This paper introduces generalized distribution factors derived from a voltage-sensitive linearization of the full AC power flow equations. The proposed formulation accurately reflects reactive power flows, Ohmic losses, and voltage deviations while remaining computationally efficient. We derive and evaluate generalized PTDFs, LODFs, and topology modification factors using matrix identities. We discuss potential applications including voltage-aware N-1 security analysis, and topology optimization with a focus on busbar splitting. Numerical experiments demonstrate close agreement with full AC solutions, significantly outperforming the traditional DC approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a control methodology for achieving orbital stabilization with simultaneous time synchronization of periodic trajectories in underactuated robotic systems. The proposed approach extends the classical transverse linearization framework to explicitly incorporate time-desynchronization dynamics. To stabilize the resulting extended transverse dynamics, we employ a combination of time-varying LQR and sliding-mode control. The theoretical results are validated experimentally through the implementation of both centralized and decentralized control strategies on a group of six Butterfly robots.</description>

      <title>Choose Your Battles: Distributed Learning Over Multiple Tug of War Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider N players and K games taking place simultaneously. Each of these games is modeled as a Tug-of-War (ToW) game where increasing the action of one player decreases the reward for all other players. Each player participates in only one game at any given time. At each time step, a player decides the game in which they wish to participate in and the action they take in that game. Their reward depends on the actions of all players that are in the same game. This system of K games is termed `Meta Tug-of-War' (Meta-ToW) game. These games can model scenarios such as power control, distributed task allocation, and activation in sensor networks. We propose the Meta Tug-of-Peace algorithm, a distributed algorithm where the action updates are done using a simple stochastic approximation algorithm, and the decision to switch games is made using an infrequent 1-bit communication between the players. We prove that in Meta-ToW games, our algorithm converges to an equilibrium that satisfies a target Quality of Service reward vector for the players. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through simulations for the scenarios mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Coordination Control of Discrete Event Systems under Cyber Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, coordination control of discrete event systems under joint sensor and actuator attacks is investigated. Sensor attacks are described by a set of attack languages using a proposed ALTER model. Several local supervisors are used to control the system. The goal is to design local supervisors to ensure safety of the system even under cyber attacks (CA). The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such supervisors are derived in terms of conditional decomposability, CA-controllability and CA-observability. A method is developed to calculate local state estimates under sensor attacks. Two methods are also developed to design local supervisors, one for discrete event systems satisfying conditional decomposability, CA-controllability and CA-observability, and one for discrete event systems satisfying conditional decomposability only. The approach works for both stealthy and non-stealthy attacks. A practical example is given to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Minimum Time Consensus of Multi-agent System under Fuel Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of finding minimum time consensus point in the state space for a set of $N$ identical double integrator agents with bounded inputs and fixed fuel budget constraint. To address the problem, characterization of the attainable set for each agent subject to bounded inputs and fixed fuel budget constraints is done. Such attainable set is shown to be a convex set. The minimum time to consensus is the least time when the attainable sets of all agents intersect and the corresponding consensus state is the point of intersection. Using Helly's theorem, it is shown that the intersection is not empty at the time when all triplets of agents exhibit a non-empty intersection. Thus, a closed-form expression for the minimum time to consensus for a triplet of agents is obtained. The calculation of minimum time consensus for each of the triplets is performed independently and is distributed evenly among $N$ agents. The overall minimum time to consensus of $N$ agents is then given by the triplet that has the greatest minimum time to consensus. In the process, the set of initial conditions for agents from which consensus is possible under these input and fuel budget constraints is also characterized.</description>

      <title>TuneS: Patient-specific model-based optimization of contact configuration in deep brain stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a systematic approach to optimize Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) parameters, addressing the challenge of identifying patient-specific settings and optimal stimulation targets for various neurological and mental disorders. Methods: TuneS, a novel pipeline to predict clinically optimal DBS contact configurations based on predefined targets and constraints, is introduced. The method relies upon patient-specific models of stimulation spread and extends optimization beyond traditional neural structures to include automated, model-based targeting of streamlines. Results: Initial findings show that both the STN motor subdivision and STN motor streamlines are consistently engaged under clinical settings, while regions of avoidance receive minimal stimulation. Given these findings, the value of model-based contact predictions for assessing stimulation targets while observing anatomical constraints is demonstrated at the example of a small cohort of Parkinson's disease patients. The predicted settings were generally found to achieve higher target coverages while providing a better trade-off between maximizing target coverage and minimizing stimulation of regions associated with side effects. Conclusion: TuneS shows promise as a research tool, enabling systematic assessment of DBS target effectiveness and facilitating constraint-aware optimization of stimulation parameters. Significance: The presented pipeline offers a pathway to improve patient-specific DBS therapies and contributes to the broader understanding of effective DBS targeting strategies.</description>

      <title>Scalable Two-Stage Stochastic Optimal Power Flow via Separable Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Separable Projective Approximation Routine-Optimal Power Flow (SPAR-OPF) framework for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems in power systems. The framework utilizes a separable piecewise linear approximation of the value function and learns the function based on sample sub-gradient information. We present two formulations to model the learned value function, and compare their effectiveness. Additionally, an efficient statistical method is introduced to assess the quality of the obtained solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using distributed generation siting and sizing problem in three-phase unbalanced power distribution systems as an example. Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%. The framework scales efficiently with system size, generating high-quality solutions in a short time when applied to a 9500-node distribution system with 1200 scenarios, while the extensive formulations and progressive hedging failed to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>Exploring Noncommutative Polynomial Equation Methods for Discrete-Time Quaternionic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new polynomial-based methods for discrete-time quaternionic systems, highlighting how noncommutative multiplication modifies classical control approaches. Defining quaternionic polynomials via a backward-shift operator, we examine left and right fraction representations of transfer functions, showing that right zeros correspond to similarity classes of quaternionic matrix right eigenvalues. We then propose a feedback design procedure that generalizes pole placement to quaternions - a first approach using a genuine quaternionic polynomial equation.</description>

      <title>Probability-One Optimization of Generalized Rayleigh Quotient Sum For Multi-Source Generalized Total Least-Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the global optimization of the sum of the Rayleigh quotient and the generalized Rayleigh quotient on the unit sphere. While various methods have been proposed for this problem, they fail to reliably converge to the global maximizer. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extension of the Riemannian Trust Region algorithm based on the probability-one homotopy optimization method, which enhances convergence to a global maximizer and, under certain conditions, ensures convergence to the global maximizer. In addition to the proposed method, existing state-of-the-art approaches are also presented, along with an explanation of their limitations and their connection to the proposed method. The proposed method is evaluated alongside the state-of-the-art approaches through numerical experiments, assessing convergence speed, success in reaching the global maximizer, and scalability with increasing problem dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this ties in with the multi-source Bayesian Generalized Total Least-Squares (B-GTLS) problem, illustrating its applicability.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Transmission Flexibility under Uncertainty: Getting Dynamic Line Ratings into Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Data-fused Model Predictive Control with Guarantees: Application to Flying Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Data-Fused Model Predictive Control (DFMPC) framework that combines physics-based models with data-driven representations of unknown dynamics. Leveraging Willems' Fundamental Lemma and an artificial equilibrium formulation, the method enables tracking of changing, potentially unreachable setpoints while explicitly handling measurement noise through slack variables and regularization. We provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and practical stability under input-output constraints for a specific class of reference signals. The approach is validated on the iRonCub flying humanoid robot, integrating analytical momentum models with data-driven turbine dynamics. Simulations show improved tracking and robustness compared to a purely model-based MPC, while maintaining real-time feasibility.</description>

      <title>MAPPO for Edge Server Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a goal-oriented communication problem for edge server monitoring, where jobs arrive intermittently at multiple dispatchers and must be assigned to shared edge servers with finite queues and time-varying availability. Accurate knowledge of server status is critical for sustaining high throughput, yet remains challenging under dynamic workloads and partial observability. To address this challenge, each dispatcher maintains server knowledge through two complementary mechanisms: (i) active status queries that provide instantaneous updates at a communication cost, and (ii) job execution feedback that reveals server conditions opportunistically. We formulate a cooperative multi-agent distributed decision-making problem in which dispatchers jointly optimize query scheduling to balance throughput against communication overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)-based algorithm that leverages centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) to learn distributed query-and-dispatch policies under partial and stale observations. Numerical evaluations show that MAPPO achieves superior throughput-cost tradeoffs and significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving on average a 30% improvement over the closest baseline.</description>

      <title>Explicit Steady-State Approximations for Parallel Server Systems with Heterogeneous Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the steady-state performance of parallel-server systems under an immediate routing architecture with two sources of heterogeneity: servers and job classes, subject to compatibility constraints. We focus on the weighted-workload-task-allocation (WWTA) policy, a load-balancing scheme known to be throughput-optimal for such systems. Under a relaxed complete-resource-pooling (CRP) condition, we prove a "strong form" of state-space collapse in heavy traffic and that the scaled workload of each server converges in distribution to an exponential random variable, whose parameter is explicitly given by system primitives. Our analysis yields three main insights. First, the conventional heavy-traffic requirement of a unique static allocation plan can be dropped; a relaxed CRP condition suffices. Second, the limiting workload distribution is shown to be independent of local scheduling policy on server side, allowing substantial flexibility. Third, the inefficient (non-basic) activities prescribed by static allocation plan is proved to receive an asymptotically negligible fraction of routing and service, even though WWTA has no prior knowledge of which activities are basic, highlighting its robustness to changing arrival rates.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Latent Safety Filters for Avoiding Out-of-Distribution Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled classical safe control methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to generalize to complex robotic systems operating directly from high-dimensional sensor observations. However, obtaining comprehensive coverage of all safety-critical scenarios during world model training is extremely challenging. As a result, latent safety filters built on top of these models may miss novel hazards and even fail to prevent known ones, overconfidently misclassifying risky out-of-distribution (OOD) situations as safe. To address this, we introduce an uncertainty-aware latent safety filter that proactively steers robots away from both known and unseen failures. Our key idea is to use the world model's epistemic uncertainty as a proxy for identifying unseen potential hazards. We propose a principled method to detect OOD world model predictions by calibrating an uncertainty threshold via conformal prediction. By performing reachability analysis in an augmented state space-spanning both the latent representation and the epistemic uncertainty-we synthesize a latent safety filter that can reliably safeguard arbitrary policies from both known and unseen safety hazards. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our uncertainty-aware safety filter preemptively detects potential unsafe scenarios and reliably proposes safe, in-distribution actions.

      <description>arXiv:2507.08011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an energy management system (EMS) for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers with colocated renewable generation. Under a cost-minimizing framework, the EMS of renewable-colocated data center (RCDC) co-optimizes AI workload scheduling, on-site renewable utilization, and electricity market participation. Within both wholesale and retail market participation models, the economic benefit of the RCDC operation is maximized. Empirical evaluations using real-world traces of electricity prices, data center power consumption, and renewable generation demonstrate significant electricity cost reduction from renewable and AI data center colocations.</description>
