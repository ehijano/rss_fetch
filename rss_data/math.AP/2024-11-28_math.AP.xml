      <title>Almost sure well-posedness and orbital stability for Schr\"odinger equation with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the almost sure well-posedness theory and orbital stability for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with potential \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l} i \partial_t u+\Delta u-V(x)u+|u|^{2}u=0,\ (x, t) \in \mathbb{R}^4 \times \mathbb{R}, \\ \left.u\right|_{t=0}=f \in H ^s(\mathbb{R}^4), \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $\frac{1}{3}&lt;s&lt;1$ and $V(x):\mathbb{R}^4\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies appropriate conditions. The main idea in the proofs is based on Strichartz spaces as well as variants of local smoothing, inhomogeneous local smoothing and maximal function spaces. To our best knowledge, this is the first almost sure orbital stability result.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for NLS equations with potential on bounded domains: Ground states and multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate normalized solutions for a class of nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equations with potential $V$ and inhomogeneous nonlinearity $g(|u|)u=|u|^{q-2}u+\beta |u|^{p-2}u$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$. Firstly, when $2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q&lt;p\leq2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ and $\beta=-1$, under an explicit smallness assumption on $V$, we prove the existence of a global minimum solution and a high-energy solution if the mass is large enough. For this case we do not require that $\Omega$ is star-shaped, which partly solves an open problem by Bartsch et al. [Math. Ann. 390 (2024) 4813--4859]. Moreover, we find that the global minimizer also exists although the nonlinearity is $L^2$-supercritical. Secondly, when $2&lt;q&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;p=2^*$ and $\beta=1$, under the smallness and some extra assumptions on $V$, we prove the existence of a ground state and a high-energy solution if $\Omega$ is star-shaped and the mass is small enough. It seems to be new in the study of normalized ground state in the context of the Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg problem, even for the autonomous case of $V(x)\equiv0$.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of solution to a hyperbolic-parabolic free boundary problem for biofilm growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the existence and uniqueness of solution to a free boundary value problem related to biofilm growth. The problem consists of a system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations governing the microbial species growth, and a system of parabolic partial differential equations describing the substrate dynamics. The free boundary evolution is governed by an ordinary differential equation that accounts for the thickness of the biofilm. We use the method of characteristics and fixed point strategies to prove the existence and uniqueness theorem in small and all times. All the equations are converted into integral equations, in particular this transformation is made for the parabolic equations by using the Green's functions. We consider Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Robin boundary conditions for the substrates equations and their extension to the case with variable</description>

      <title>Gradient flow of phase transitions with fixed contact angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gradient flow of the Allen-Cahn equation with fixed boundary contact angle in Euclidean domains for initial data with bounded energy. Under general assumptions, we establish both interior and boundary convergence properties for the solutions and associated energy measures. Under various boundary non-concentration assumptions, we show that, for almost every time, the associated limiting varifolds satisfy generalised contact angle conditions and have bounded first variation, as well as deducing that the trace of the limit of the solutions coincides with the limit of their traces. Moreover, we derive an Ilmanen type monotonicity formula, for initial data with bounded energy, valid for the associated energy measures up to the boundary.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Heat Generation Using Plasmonics: A Parabolic Transmission Problem Driven by the Maxwell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciting nanoparticles with incident frequencies close to their (subwavelength) resonances generate heat in the surrounding medium. Estimating the amount of heat generated is crucial for several applications. In this work, we consider the case of multiple such nanoparticles, aiming to estimate the generated effective heat. Specifically, we focus on plasmonic nanoparticles (e.g., metals) excited by an appropriate range of frequencies containing their plasmonic resonances. We derive the following results:
  1. When the nanoparticles are arbitrarily distributed within a bounded domain, the generated heat is described by a system of Volterra-type integral equations. The source terms, determined by the electric intensity of each nanoparticle, are themselves solutions of an algebraic system of Foldy-type equations. Thus, the (discrete) effective heat can be computed by solving these two coupled systems of equations. The dimensions of these systems are determined by the number of nanoparticles.
  2. When the number of nanoparticles is large, we derive the generated effective heat in a continuous form under certain natural scaling regimes. The corresponding effective heat equation is characterized, with the source terms related to the electric intensities obtained as solutions of the full Maxwell system with an effective permittivity that is also characterized.
  With this approach, we reduce the problem of heat generation using plasmonic nanoparticles to two sub-problems, namely a control problem for the parabolic model and an internal phaseless inverse problem for the Maxwell model.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of limit wave speed of periodic traveling wave solutions via Abelian integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate monotonicity of limit wave speed of periodic traveling wave solutions for a perturbed generalized KdV equation via Abelian integral. We have answered an open problem outlined by Yan et al. (2014) and the conjecture proposed by Ouyang et al. (2022). Geometric singular perturbation theory allows for the reduction of a three-dimensional dynamical system to a near-Hamiltonian planar system. Furthermore, utilizing the monotonic behavior of the ratio of Abelian integrals, we develop a method to show the existence of at most one isolated periodic traveling wave which is much simpler proof than that in Yan et al.(2014). Finally, we present numerical simulations that perfectly match the theoretical outcomes.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb{T}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global well-posedness of the energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ for general dimensions. This result is new for dimensions $d\ge5$, extending previous results for $d=3,4$ [10,22]. Compared to the cases $d=3,4$, the regularity theory for higher $d$, developed in the underlying local well-posedness result [17], is less understood. In particular, stability theory and inverse inequalities, which are ingredients in [10,22] and more generally in the widely used concentration compactness framework since [13], are too weak to be applied to higher dimensions.
  Our proof introduces a new strategy for addressing global well-posedness problems. Without relying on perturbation theory, we develop tools to analyze the concentration dynamics of the nonlinear flow. On the way, we show the formation of a nontrivial concentration.</description>

      <title>Mathematical properties of Klein-Gordon-Boussinesq systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon-Boussinesq (KGB) system is proposed in the literature as a model problem to study the validity of approximations in the long wave limit provided by simpler equations such as KdV, nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger or Whitham equations. In this paper, the KGB system is analyzed as a mathematical model in three specific points. The first one concerns well-posedness of the initial-value problem with the study of local existence and uniqueness of solution and the conditions under which the local solution is global or blows up at finite time. The second point is focused on traveling wave solutions of the KGB system. The existence of different types of solitary waves is derived from two classical approaches, while from their numerical generation several properties of the solitary wave profiles are studied. In addition, the validity of the KdV approximation is analyzed by computational means and from the corresponding KdV soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic well-posedness of generalized cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with strong dispersion using higher order expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local well-posedness of the cubic Schr\"odinger equation $$(i\partial_t + \mathcal{L}) u = \pm |u|^2 u \qquad \textrm{on} \quad \ I\times \mathbb{R}^d ,$$ with initial data being a Wiener randomization at unit scale of a given function $f$ and $\mathcal{L}$ being an operator of degree $\sigma\geq 2$. In particular, we prove that a solution exists almost-surely locally in time provided $f\in H^{S}_{x}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ with $S&gt;\frac{2-\sigma}{4}$ for $d\leq \frac{3\sigma}{2}$, i.e. even if the initial datum is taken in certain negative order Sobolev spaces. The solutions are constructed as a sum of an explicit multilinear expansion of the flow in terms of the random initial data and of an additional smoother remainder term with deterministically subcritical regularity. We develop the framework of directional space-time norms to control the (probabilistic) multilinear expansion and the (deterministic) remainder term and to obtain improved bilinear probabilistic-deterministic Strichartz estimates.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\''odinger equation on a strip with Neumann boundary conditions and a delta condition on the $x$-axis. First, we show the existence of ground states as minimizers of the action or of the energy under suitable constraints. Second, we prove that the energy minimizers converge to the ground state on the line with a delta condition as the amplitude of the strip shrinks to zero.</description>

      <title>The isotropic relaxed micromorphic model in polar coordinates and its application to an elastostatic axisymmetric extension problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the isotropic relaxed micromorphic model in polar coordinates and use this representation to solve explicitly an elastostatic axisymmetric extension problem involving a linear system of ordinary differential equations. To obtain an analytical solution, modified Bessel functions are utilized and closed-form solutions for the displacement and microdistortion are obtained. We show how certain limit cases (classical linear elasticity), which are naturally included in the relaxed micromorphic model, can be efficiently achieved. Furthermore, numerical results are calculated and the effects of various parameters are examined. The results can be used to calibrate and check corresponding finite element codes.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and regularity of weak solutions of a drift-diffusion system for perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a novel uniqueness result for an instationary drift-diffusion model for perovskite solar cells. This model for vacancy-assisted charge transport uses Fermi--Dirac statistics for electrons and holes and Blakemore statistics for the mobile ionic vacancies in the perovskite. Existence of weak solutions and their boundedness was proven in a previous work. For the uniqueness proof, we establish improved integrability of the gradients of the charge-carrier densities. Based on estimates obtained in the previous paper, we consider suitably regularized continuity equations with partly frozen arguments and apply the regularity results for scalar quasilinear elliptic equations by Meinlschmidt &amp; Rehberg, Evolution Equations and Control Theory, 2016, 5(1):147-184.</description>

      <title>A gentle invitation to the fractional world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book is intended as a self-contained introduction to selected topics in the fractional world, focusing particularly on aspects that arise in the study of equations driven by the fractional Laplacian.
  The scope of this work is not intended to be exhaustive or all-encompassing. We have chosen topics that we believe will appeal to readers embarking on their journey into fractional analysis. It requires only fundamental calculus and a basic understanding of measure theory.
  In Chapter 1, we introduce the primary object of study, the fractional Laplacian. This operator appears in diverse contexts, prompting multiple definitions and viewpoints, many of which we explore, along with some key identities.
  A notable distinction between local and nonlocal analysis is that in the latter, explicit calculations are often impractical or impossible. There are anyway some fortunate exceptions which are gathered in Chapter 2, providing useful and instructive examples.
  Chapter 3 presents an introduction to the important aspect of Liouville-type results.
  A large portion of this book is devoted to the regularity theory of solutions in Lebesgue spaces. Chapter 4 examines global solutions using Riesz and Bessel potential analysis, capturing the impact of both low and high frequencies on smoothness, decay, and oscillations. These spaces are also flexible enough to provide, as a byproduct, a solid regularity theory in the more commonly used fractional Sobolev spaces.
  In Chapter 5 we derive the corresponding interior regularity theory for solutions within a bounded domain using appropriate cutoffs and localization techniques.
  Additionally, technical appendices include auxiliary results used in key proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that a closed $1$-rectifiable set $\Gamma_0\subset \mathbb R^2$ of finite $1$-dimensional Hausdorff measure and a vector field $u$ in a dimensionally critical Sobolev space are given. It is proved that, starting from $\Gamma_0$, there exists a non-trivial flow of curves with the velocity given by the sum of the curvature and the given vector field $u$. The motion law is satisfied in the sense of Brakke and the flow exists through singularities.</description>

Abstract: We consider an initial-boundary value problem for the chemotaxis-Navier--Stokes system \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{c@{\quad}l@{\quad}l@{\,}c} n_{t}+u\cdot\nabla n=\nabla\cdot\big(D(n)\nabla n-nS(x,n,c)\cdot\nabla c\big),\ &amp;x\in\Omega,&amp; t&gt;0,\\ c_{t}+u\cdot\nabla c=\Delta c-cn,\ &amp;x\in\Omega,&amp; t&gt;0,\\ u_{t}+(u\cdot\nabla)u=\Delta u+\nabla P+n\nabla\Phi,\quad \nabla\cdot u=0,\ &amp;x\in\Omega,&amp; t&gt;0,\\ \big(D(n)\nabla n-nS(x,n,c)\cdot\nabla c)\cdot\nu=\nabla c\cdot\nu=0,\ u=0,\ &amp;x\in\partial\Omega,&amp; t&gt;0,\\ n(\cdot,0)=n_0,\ c(\cdot,0)=c_0,\ u(\cdot,0)=u_0,\ &amp;x\in\Omega. \end{array}\right. \end{align*} in a smoothly bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$. Assuming $S:\overline{\Omega}\times[0,\infty)\times(0,\infty)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}$ to be sufficiently regular and such that with $\gamma\in[0,\frac56]$ and some non-decreasing $S_0:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$, we have \begin{align*} \big|S(x,n,c)\big|\leq \frac{S_0(c)}{c^\gamma}\quad\text{for all }(x,n,c)\in\overline{\Omega}\times[0,\infty)\times(0,\infty), \end{align*} we show that if $D:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ is suitably regular and positive throughout $(0,\infty)$, then for all $M&gt;0$ one can find $L(M)&gt;0$ such that whenever $$\liminf_{n\to\infty} D(n)&gt;L\quad\text{and}\quad \liminf_{n\searrow0}\frac{D(n)}{n}&gt;0$$ are satisfied and the initial data $(n_0,c_0,u_0)$ are suitably regular and satisfy $\|c_0\|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}\leq M$ there is a global and bounded weak solution for the initial-boundary value problem above. Under the additional assumption of $D(0)&gt;0$ this solution is moreover a classical solution of the same problem.</description>

      <title>Short-time existence and uniqueness for some infinite-dimensional Nash systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local (in time) existence and uniqueness for a class of infinite-dimensional Nash systems, namely systems of infinitely many Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations set in an infinite-dimensional Euclidean space. Such systems have been recently showed (see arXiv:2401.06534) to arise in the theory of stochastic differential games with interactions governed by sparse graphs, under structural assumptions that inspired the hypotheses exploited in the present work. Contextually, we also prove a general linear result, providing a priori estimates, stable with respect to the dimension, for transport-diffusion equations whose drifts (and their derivatives) enjoy appropriate decay properties.</description>

      <title>A new proof of nonlinear Landau damping for the 3D Vlasov-Poisson system near Poisson equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates nonlinear Landau damping in the 3D Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. We study the asymptotic stability of the Poisson equilibrium $\mu(v)=\frac{1}{\pi^2(1+|v|^2)^2}$
  under small perturbations. Building on the foundational work of Ionescu, Pausader, Wang, and Widmayer \cite{AIonescu2022}, we provide a streamlined proof of nonlinear Landau damping for the 3D unscreened VP system. Our analysis leverages sharp decay estimates, novel decomposition techniques to demonstrate the stabilization of the particle distribution and the decay of electric field. These results reveal the free transport-like behavior for the perturbed density $\rho(t,x)$, and enhance the understanding of Landau damping in an unconfined setting near stable equilibria.</description>

      <title>Self-similar instability and forced nonuniqueness: an application to the 2D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on an approach introduced by Golovkin in the '60s, we show that nonuniqueness in some forced PDEs is a direct consequence of the existence of a self-similar linearly unstable eigenvalue: the key point is a clever choice of the forcing term removing complicated nonlinear interactions. We use this method to give a short and self-contained proof of nonuniqueness in 2D perfect fluids, first obtained in Vishik's groundbreaking result. In particular, we present a direct construction of a forced self-similar unstable vortex, where we treat perturbatively the self-similar operator in a new and more quantitative way.</description>

      <title>On the Schr\"odinger equations with $B_\infty$ potentials in the region above a Lipschitz graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the $L^p$ regularity, $L^p$ Neumann and $W^{1,p}$ problems for generalized Schr\"odinger operator $-\text{div}(A\nabla )+ V $ in the region above a Lipschitz graph under the assumption that $A$ is elliptic, symmetric and $x_d-$independent. Specifically, we prove that the $L^p$ regularity problem is uniquely solvable for $$1&lt;p&lt;2+\varepsilon.$$
  Moreover, we also establish the $W^{1,p}$ estimate for Neumann problem for
  $$\frac{3}{2}-\varepsilon&lt;p&lt;3+\varepsilon.$$
  As a by-product, we also obtain that the $L^p$ Neumann problem is uniquely solvable for $1&lt;p&lt;2+\varepsilon.$
  The only previously known estimates of this type pertain to the classical Schr\"odinger equation $-\Delta u+ Vu=0$ in $\Omega$ and $\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=g$ on $\partial\Omega$ which was obtained by Shen [Z. Shen, On the Neumann problem for Schr\"odinger operators in Lipschitz domains, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 43 (1994)] for ranges $1&lt;p\leq 2$.
  All the ranges of $p$ are sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a phase-field approximation for a model that describes the epitaxial growth of a thin film on a substrate in the context of linearized elasticity. The approximated model encodes a variable on the free surface of the film, that physically is interpreted with an adatom density. This collocates the model in the context of the crystal growth, beside being a mass constrained $\Gamma$-convergence result.</description>

      <title>Interior and Boundary Regularity of Mixed Local Nonlocal Problem with Singular Data and Its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the H\"older regularity of solutions to equations involving a mixed local-nonlocal nonlinear nonhomogeneous operator $(-\Delta)_{p} + (-\Delta)_{q}^{s}$, under the minimal assumption that $p&gt; sq$. The regularity result is twofold: we establish interior gradient H\"older regularity for locally bounded data and boundary regularity for singular data. We prove both boundary H\"older and gradient H\"older boundary regularity depending on the degree of singularity. Additionally, we establish a strong comparison principle for this class of problems, which holds independent significance. As the applications of these qualitative results, we further study sublinear and subcritical perturbations of singular nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear parabolic model that forces solutions to stay on a $L^2$-sphere through a nonlocal term in the equation. We study the local and global well-posedness on a bounded domain and the whole Euclidean space in the energy space. Then, we consider the solutions' asymptotic behavior. We prove strong convergence to a stationary state and asymptotic convergence to the ground state in bounded domains when the initial condition is positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system is a kinetic model for collisionless plasmas. For the two-dimensional model, global well-posedness of this model is known and was proven by deriving global bounds on the momentum support of the particle density function. In this paper, we prove bounds on the magnitude of the momentum support in one direction depending on the magnitude of the support in the corresponding orthogonal direction.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a concise development of the well-studied theory of trace class operators on infinite dimensional (separable) Hilbert spaces suitable for an advanced undergraduate, as well as a construction of the inverse Laplacian on closed manifolds. With these developments acting as prerequisite, we present original trace computations involving the inverse Laplacian on the (flat) torus, generalizing computations done by R. Grady and O. Gwilliam within the context of topological quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A note on the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski inequality for intrinsic volumes and the $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to improve some of the results in \cite{BCPR}. Namely, we establish the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkwoski inequality for intrinsic volumes for origin-symmetric convex bodies that are close to the ball in the $C^2$ sense for a certain range of $p&lt;1$ (including negative values) and we prove that this inequality does not hold true in the entire class of origin-symmetric convex bodies for any $p&lt;1$. The second goal is to establish a uniqueness result for the (closely related) $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. More specifically, we show uniqueness in the symmetric case when $p\in[0,1)$ and the data function $g$ in the right hand side is sufficiently close to the constant 1. One of the main ingredients of the proof is the existence of upper and lower bounds for the (convex) solution, that depend only $\|\log g\|_{L^\infty}$, a fact that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Validated matrix multiplication transform for orthogonal polynomials with applications to computer-assisted proofs for PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we achieve three primary objectives related to the rigorous computational analysis of nonlinear PDEs posed on complex geometries such as disks and cylinders. First, we introduce a validated Matrix Multiplication Transform (MMT) algorithm, analogous to the discrete Fourier transform, which offers a reliable framework for evaluating nonlinearities in spectral methods while effectively mitigating challenges associated with rounding errors. Second, we examine the Zernike polynomials, a spectral basis well-suited for problems on the disk, and highlight their essential properties. We further demonstrate how the MMT approach can be effectively employed to compute the product of truncated Zernike series, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we combine the MMT framework and Zernike series to construct computer-assisted proofs that establish the existence of solutions to two distinct nonlinear elliptic PDEs on the disk.</description>

Abstract: Given a smooth integral two-form and a smooth potential on the flat torus of dimension 2, we study the high energy properties of the corresponding magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. Under a geometric condition on the magnetic field, we show that every sequence of high energy eigenfunctions satisfies the quantum unique ergodicity property even if the Liouville measure is not ergodic for the underlying classical flow (the Euclidean geodesic flow on the 2-torus).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of some controllability issues for the forward stochastic heat equation with dynamic boundary conditions. The main novelty in the present paper consists of considering only one control without extra forces in the noise parts. Under a strong measurability condition, and using a spectral inequality, we first establish an appropriate observability inequality for the corresponding adjoint system. Then, by the classical duality approach, the null and approximate controllability results are established.</description>

Abstract: Let $L$ be a L\'evy operator. A function $h$ is said to be harmonic with respect to $L$ if $L h = 0$ in an appropriate sense. We prove Liouville's theorem for positive functions harmonic with respect to a general L\'evy operator $L$: such functions are necessarily mixtures of exponentials. For signed harmonic functions we provide a fairly general result, which encompasses and extends all Liouville-type theorems previously known in this context, and which allows to trade regularity assumptions on $L$ for growth restrictions on $h$. Finally, we construct an explicit counterexample which shows that Liouville's theorem for signed functions harmonic with respect to a general L\'evy operator $L$ does not hold.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of a class of orbitally stable bound state solutions to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with super-quadratic confinement in two and three spatial dimensions. These solutions are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile which in itself is obtained via a doubly constrained energy minimization. One of the two constraints imposed is the total mass, while the other is given by the expectation value of the angular momentum around the z-axis. Our approach also allows for a new description of the set of minimizers subject to only a single mass constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and optimal time decay rate of solution to the one-dimensional (1D) two-phase flow described by compressible Euler equations coupled with compressible Navier-Stokes equations through the relaxation drag force on the momentum equations (Euler-Navier-Stokes system). First, we prove the global existence of a strong solution and the stability of the constant equilibrium state to 1D Cauchy problem of compressible Euler-Navier-Stokes system by using the standard continuity argument for small $H^{1}$ data while its second order derivative can be large. Then we derive the optimal time decay rate to the constant equilibrium state. Compared with the multi-dimensional case, it is much harder to get the optimal time decay rate by the direct spectrum method due to a slower convergence rate of the fundamental solution in the 1D case. To overcome this main difficulty, we need to first carry out time-weighted energy estimates (not optimal) for higher order derivatives, and based on these time-weighted estimates, we can close a priori assumptions and get the optimal time decay rate by spectral analysis method. Moreover, due to the non-conserved form and insufficient decay rate of the coupled drag force terms between the two-phase flows, we essentially need to use momentum variables $(m= \rho u, M=n\omega)$, rather than velocity variables $(u, \omega)$ in the spectrum analysis, to fully cancel out those non-conserved and insufficient time decay drag force terms.</description>

      <title>Tug-of-war games related to oblique derivative boundary value problems with the normalized $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with game-theoretic interpretations to the following oblique derivative boundary value problem \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \Delta_{p}^{N}u=0 &amp; \textrm{in $ \Omega$,}\\ \langle \beta , Du \rangle + \gamma u = \gamma G &amp; \textrm{on $ \partial \Omega$,}\\ \end{array} \right. \end{align*} where $\Delta_{p}^{N}$ is the normalized $p$-Laplacian. This problem can be regarded as a generalized version of the Robin boundary value problem for the Laplace equations. We construct several types of stochastic games associated with this problem by using `shrinking tug-of-war'. For the value functions of such games, we investigate the properties such as existence, uniqueness, regularity and convergence.</description>

      <title>Identification of a Spatially-Dependent Variable Order in One-Dimensional Subdiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate an inverse problem of identifying a spatially variable order in the one-dimensional subdiffusion model from the boundary flux measurement. The model involves a generalized Caputo derivative in time, and arises in the mathematical modeling of anomalous diffusion in heterogeneous media. We prove the unique recovery of a monotone piecewise constant variable order and its range for known and unknown media, respectively. The analysis is based on a delicate asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transform of the data as $p\to0$, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Spatially-invariant opinion dynamics on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a nonlinear opinion dynamics model for an agent making decisions about a continuous distribution of options in the presence of input. Inspired by perceptual decision-making, we develop new theory for opinion formation in response to inputs about options distributed on the circle. Options on the circle can represent, e.g., the possible directions of perceived objects and resulting heading directions in planar robotic navigation problems. Interactions among options are encoded through a spatially invariant kernel, which we design to ensure that only a small (finite) subset of options can be favored over the continuum. We leverage the spatial invariance of the model linearization to design flexible, distributed opinion-forming behaviors using spatiotemporal frequency domain and bifurcation analysis. We illustrate our model's versatility with an application to robotic navigation in crowded spaces.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet Problem For the Logarithmic p-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian $L_{\Delta_p}$, which emerges from the formal derivative of the fractional $p$-Laplacian $(-\Delta_p)^s$ at $s=0$. This operator is nonlocal, has logarithmic order, and is the nonlinear version of the newly developed logarithmic Laplacian operator. We present a variational framework to study the Dirichlet problems involving the $L_{\Delta_p}$ in bounded domains. This allows us to investigate the connection between the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and eigenfunction of the fractional $p$-Laplacian and the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian. As a consequence, we deduce a Faber-Krahn inequality for the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $L_{\Delta_p}$. We discuss maximum and comparison principles for $L_{\Delta_p}$ in bounded domains and demonstrate that the validity of these depends on the sign of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of $L_{\Delta_p}$. In addition, we prove that the first Dirichlet eigenfunction of $L_{\Delta_p}$ is bounded. Furthermore, we establish a boundary Hardy-type inequality for the spaces associated with the weak formulation of the logarithmic $p$-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>On sharp anisotropic Hardy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Yanyan Li and Xukai Yan showed the following interesting Hardy inequalities with anisotropic weights: Let $n\geq 2$, $p \geq 1$, $p\alpha &gt; 1-n$, $p(\alpha + \beta)&gt; -n$, then there exists $C &gt; 0$ such that $$\||x|^{\beta}|x'|^{\alpha+1} \nabla u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)} \geq C\||x|^\beta|x'|^\alpha u\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}, \quad \forall\; u\in C_c^1(\mathbb{R}^n).$$ Here $x' = (x_1,\ldots, x_{n-1}, 0)$ for $x = (x_i) \in \mathbb{R}^n$. In this note, we will determine the best constant for the above estimate when $p=2$ or $\beta \geq 0$. Moreover, as refinement for very special case of Li-Yan's result in Adv. Math. 2023, we provide explicit estimate for the anisotropic $L^p$-Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality.</description>

      <title>Removing singularities for fully nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show removability of half-line singularities for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic PDEs which have classical density and a Jacobi inequality. An example of such a PDE is the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, and the original proof follows from Caffarelli 1990. Other examples are the minimal surface and special Lagrangian equations. The present paper's quick doubling proof combines Savin's small perturbation theorem with the Jacobi inequality. The method more generally removes singularities satisfying the single side condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06980v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture by Hoffman, White, and the first author regarding the uniqueness of pitchfork and helicoid translators of the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We employ an arc-counting argument motivated by Morse-Rad\'o theory for translators and a rotational maximum principle. Applications to the classification of semigraphical translators in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and their limits are discussed, strengthening compactness results of the first author with Hoffman-White and with Gama-Moller.</description>
