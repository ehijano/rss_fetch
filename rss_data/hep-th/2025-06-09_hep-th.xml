      <description>arXiv:2506.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional formulation of string amplitudes via worldsheet integrals provides a parametrization of the moduli space that fails to expose the complete singularity structure of the amplitudes. This problem is solved by the positive parametrization of string amplitudes given by surfaceology. In this work, we use this formalism to study a number of properties of string amplitudes at tree-level and one-loop. We introduce several global prescriptions for an integration contour for which the integrals are finite everywhere in kinematic space. At tree-level, this is done in two ways: one directly implements the Feynman $i\varepsilon$ to analytically continue from Euclidean to Lorentzian worldsheets; the other is a generalization of the closed Pochhammer contour to arbitrary number of points. At loop-level, we present a systematic way of extracting cuts directly from the worldsheet integrand. This provides a powerful set of unitarity constraints, which we use to test the consistency of different "stringy" UV regularizations of field theory amplitudes. In addition, we identify the massive threshold expansion of the integrand, which allows us to reduce the problem to a finite set of Feynman integrals in Schwinger parametrization and provide a straightforward contour prescription reminiscent of its field-theory version.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and complexity in saddle-dominated SU(N) spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study SU($N$) spin systems that mimic the behavior of particles in $N$-dimensional de Sitter space for $N=2,3$. Their Hamiltonians describe a dynamical system with hyperbolic fixed points, leading to emergent quasinormal modes at the quantum level. These manifest as quasiparticle peaks in the density of states. For a particle in 2-dimensional de Sitter, we find both principal and complementary series densities of states from a PT-symmetric version of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, having two hyperbolic fixed points in the classical phase space. We then study different spectral and dynamical properties of this class of models, including level spacing statistics, two-point functions, squared commutators, spectral form factor, Krylov operator and state complexity. We find that, even though the early-time properties of these quantities are governed by the saddle points -- thereby in some cases mimicking corresponding properties of chaotic systems, a close look at the late-time behavior reveals the integrable nature of the system.</description>

      <title>Generating Hodges' Graviton MHV Formula with an $Lw_{1+\infty}$ Ward Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hodges' formula expresses the tree-level all-multiplicity Einstein gravity MHV amplitude as a matrix determinant. In this work, we prove that Hodges' determinant is generated by an $Lw_{1+\infty}$ Ward identity on the celestial sphere. The Ward identity takes the form of a recursion relation that has not previously appeared in the literature and is unrelated to BCFW. The proof makes use of the matrix-tree theorem.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption in Topological Solitons and the Emergence of an Effective Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the dynamics of particles and strings falling into smooth horizonless spacetimes that match the Schwarzschild black hole but replace its horizon with a smooth cap in supergravity. The cap consists of a regular topological structure formed by the deformations of extra compact dimensions. We show that infalling particles follow Schwarzschild-like trajectories down to the cap, but experience rapidly growing tidal forces that reach extreme values. In addition, infalling strings encounter a region of tidal instability localized at the cap, where transverse modes are excited. This stringy excitation drains their kinetic energy, resulting in tidal trapping. We demonstrate that the onset and strength of this instability depend sensitively on the Kaluza-Klein scale, the string scale, and the mass of the spacetime, ensuring that strings cannot escape the cap region. These results show that horizonless geometries can reproduce key features of black hole absorption while maintaining regularity at the horizon scale, offering compelling evidence for the emergence of effective horizon-like behavior from topological spacetime structures.</description>

      <title>Planar Abelian Duals of Chern-Simons QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose novel infrared dualities connecting 2+1 dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories (with unitary or special unitary gauge groups) to Abelian gauge theories. The dual Abelian theories are characterized by a planar quiver structure, where interactions are fully encoded in the quiver diagram. These dualities are rooted in supersymmetric mirror symmetry and display the characteristic exchange of mesonic and monopole operators. Furthermore, our proposed dualities exhibit features of bosonization: the addition of a fermionic (bosonic) flavor to the non-Abelian side corresponds to the addition of a bosonic (fermionic) column in the dual planar quiver.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of the $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a field-theoretic tool that enable us to evaluate the critical exponents of $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized systems undergoing continuous phase transitions, namely $\delta_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory. It generalizes the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs through the introduction of the $\delta_{KLS}$ parameter from which Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is recovered in the limit $\delta_{KLS}\rightarrow 0$. From the results for the critical exponents we provide the referred physical interpretation for the $\delta_{KLS}$ parameter. Although new generalized universality classes emerge, we show that they are incomplete for describing the behavior of some real materials. This task is fulfilled only for nonextensive statistical field theory, which is related to fractal derivative and multifractal geometries, up to the moment, for our knowledge.</description>

      <title>D1-brane correction to a line operator index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wilson line operators in the rank $k$ totally symmetric tensor representation of ${\cal N}=4$ $U(N)$ sypersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are expected to be realized as D3-branes expanded in $AdS_5$. Although there is a mismatch between the corresponding line operator indices even in the large $N$ and large $k$ limit, it is possible to calculate the finite $k$ correction on the AdS side as the contribution from D1-branes. We analyze D1-brane fluctuation modes and calculate the leading finite $k$ correction to the line operator index on the AdS side.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant action for free string field theory with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct fully gauge-invariant kinetic terms for open and closed string field theories on a target space with boundary. This is realized by promoting the gauge parameters at the boundary to extra dynamical modes describing boundary degrees of freedom. Having a gauge-invariant classical action, we also construct the corresponding BV master action and show that the master equation is obeyed thanks to a peculiar nilpotent structure of the BV kinetic operator. From this general construction we explicitly derive free actions for massless and massive modes of open and closed strings propagating on a target with a boundary, including linear-dilaton backgrounds.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Vacuum-Decay Valleys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard lore the decay of the false vacuum of a single-field potential is described by a semi-classical Euclidean bounce configuration that can be found using overshoot/undershoot algorithms, and whose action suppresses exponentially the decay rate. While this is generically correct, we show in a few concrete examples of potentials, previously studied in the literature for other purposes, that the vacuum decay structure can be far richer. In some cases there is no bounce and decay proceeds via the so-called pseudo-bounce configurations. In the general case with bounce, there are $2n+1$ bounces, with $n$ ranging from 0 (the standard case) to $\infty$. Some of these decay configurations we call antibounces as they have the wrong behavior for overshoot/undershoot algorithms, which can miss them. Bounce and antibounce configurations form $n$ pairs connected by pseudo-bounces. Our analysis benefits from a combined use of Euclidean and tunneling potential methods.</description>

      <title>Torus knots in adjoint representation and Vogel's universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vogel's universality gives a unified description of the adjoint sector of representation theory for simple Lie algebras in terms of three parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, which are homogeneous coordinates of Vogel's plane. It is associated with representation theory within the framework of Chern-Simons theory only, and gives rise to universal knot invariants. We extend the list of these latter further, and explain how to deal with the adjoint invariants for the torus knots $T[m,n]$ considering the case of $T[4,n]$ with odd $n$ in detail.</description>

      <title>Negative moment of inertia of large-$N_c$ gluons on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study SU($N_c$) Yang-Mills theory in $1+1$ dimensions at finite temperature on a spatial ring that rotates uniformly in a plane. We show that the effect of rotation results only in a simple kinematic enhancement of the gauge coupling $g$, which becomes rescaled by a Lorentz factor corresponding to the tangential rotational velocity of the ring. Using well-established analytic results in Yang-Mills theory in the 't Hooft limit of an infinite number of colors, we demonstrate that the moment of inertia of the large-$N_c$ gluon plasma on the ring is negative. This counterintuitive conclusion is, however, in agreement with recent first-principle numerical simulations of hot $3+1$ dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills theory that also reported a negative moment of inertia for gluon plasma in an experimentally relevant window of temperatures above the deconfinement transition. Furthermore, we argue that our picture provides a qualitative explanation for three other intriguing features observed in lattice simulations of vortical QCD: the emergence of a spatially inhomogeneous mixed phase, the inconsistency of its spatial structure with a standard picture dictated by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law, and the enhancement of the critical deconfining temperature by rotation.</description>

      <title>Probing QCD Confinement with Spin Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Once regarded as mere emptiness, the vacuum is now understood to possess a rich and complex structure, characterized by fluctuating energy fields and a condensate of virtual quark-antiquark pairs. These pairs cause spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, a fundamental phenomenon that is believed to generate over 99% of the mass in the visible universe. However, the precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement remains one of the most profound open questions in physics. Here, we investigate high energy proton-proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where those collisions could liberate virtual quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum. These virtual pairs, particularly the strange quark-antiquark pairs, are initially quantum spin-entangled and later undergo quark confinement to form hadrons such as $\Lambda$ hyperons. In this Letter, we report the first evidence of spin correlation of $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperon pairs measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC - a relative polarization signal of $(18 \pm 4)\%$ that links the spin-entangled quark pairs of the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental paradigm for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Challenging Spontaneous Quantum Collapse with XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the search for X-ray radiation as predicted from dynamical quantum collapse with low-energy electronic recoil data in the energy range of 1-140 keV from the first science run of the XENONnT dark matter detector. Spontaneous radiation is an unavoidable effect of dynamical collapse models, which were introduced as a possible solution to the long-standing measurement problem in quantum mechanics. The analysis utilizes a model that for the first time accounts for cancellation effects in the emitted spectrum, which arise in the X-ray range due to the opposing electron-proton charges in xenon atoms. New world-leading limits on the free parameters of the Markovian continuous spontaneous localization and Di\'osi-Penrose models are set, improving previous best constraints by two orders of magnitude and a factor of five, respectively. The original values proposed for the strength and the correlation length of the continuous spontaneous localization model are excluded experimentally for the first time.</description>

Abstract: These are lecture notes supporting a minicourse taught at the Summer School in Total Positivity and Quantum Field Theory at CMSA Harvard in June 2025. We give an introduction to positive geometries and their canonical forms. We present the original definition by Arkani-Hamed, Bai and Lam, and a more recent definition suggested by work of Brown and Dupont. We compute canonical forms of convex polytopes and of quasi-regular polypols, which are nonlinear generalizations of polygons in the plane. The text is a collection of known results. It contains many examples and a list of exercises.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory II: Quantum invariants of higher ribbons in $D^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a continuation of the first paper (arXiv:2501.06486) of this series, where the framework for the combinatorial quantization of the 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory with an underlying compact structure Lie 2-group $\mathbb{G}$ was laid out. In this paper, we continue our quest and characterize additive module *-functors $\omega:\mathfrak{C}_q(\mathbb{G}^{\Gamma^2})\rightarrow\mathsf{Hilb}$, which serve as a categorification of linear *-functionals (ie. a state) on a $C^*$-algebra. These allow us to construct non-Abelian Wilson surface correlations $\widehat{\mathfrak{C}}_q(\mathbb{G}^{P})$ on the discrete 2d simple polyhedra $P$ partitioning 3-manifolds. By proving its stable equivalence under 3d handlebody moves, these Wilson surface states extend to decorated 3-dimensional marked bordisms in a 4-disc $D^4$. This provides invariants of framed oriented 2-ribbonsin $D^4$ from the data of the given compact Lie 2-group $\mathbb{G}$. We find that these 2-Chern-Simons-type 2-ribbon invariants are given by bigraded $\mathbb{Z}$-modules, similar to the lasagna skein modules of Manolescu-Walker-Wedrich.</description>

      <title>Center vortices in the novel phase of staggered fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry of center vortices is studied in the novel lattice-artefact phase that appears with staggered fermions to elucidate any insight provided by the center-vortex degrees of freedom. For various numbers of fermion flavors, the single-site shift symmetry of the staggered-fermion action is broken in a finite region of the $(\beta, m)$ phase space. Simulations are performed with six degenerate fermion flavors and a range of $\beta$ values that span the phase boundary. Center vortices are demonstrated to capture the broken shift symmetry that manifests in the unphysical phase. This persists at the level of each individual plaquette orientation, where it is revealed only the plaquettes that span the broken dimension are affected. Several bulk center-vortex quantities, including the vortex and branching point densities, are considered to highlight other aspects of vortex geometry sensitive to the unphysical phase. A slight preference for the plaquettes affected by the broken shift symmetry to be pierced by a vortex is observed. This translates also to a greater branching point density in three-dimensional slices that span the broken dimension. Combined, these findings provide a novel characterization of the unphysical phase in terms of the fundamental center degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers.</description>

      <title>Fractional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole with a fractal event horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the implementation of the fractional and non-local Wheeler--DeWitt (WDW) equation within the context of Schwarzschild geometry leads to the emergence of a Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black hole (BH), which is uniquely characterized by an event horizon that exhibits fractal properties and is defined by a non-integer dimension that lies in the continuum between the values of 1 and 2. Our calculations further reveal that this intriguing fractional BH may potentially possess a temperature that is substantially lower than that of a conventional BH, thereby suggesting a significant deviation from the expected thermodynamic properties of standard BHs. These remarkable characteristics, which are intrinsically linked to the non-integer dimensionality of the event horizon, likely arise from applying the Riesz fractional derivative as a sophisticated non-local operator, thus introducing fascinating dynamics into the theoretical framework of BH physics.</description>

      <title>Onset of Driven Collisionless Reconnection in Strongly Magnetized Pair Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of driven collisionless reconnection and plasmoid formation in a magnetically dominated pair plasma, using 2D particle-in-cell simulations. Two force-free flux tubes of radius $R$ are initially pushed together with a prescribed velocity, forming a current sheet whose width shrinks until reconnection sets in. % Even in our largest simulation with $R\approx 1600$ plasma skin depths, the sheet thickness at reconnection onset is comparable to the skin depth. Plasmoid chains are seen to develop when the sheet aspect ratio $A\gtrsim30$. In the strongly magnetized limit, the onset of reconnection occurs in roughly $2$ to $6$ light-crossing times $R/c$, depending on the imposed driving timescale, which controls the duration of the linear tearing phase. In the subsequent nonlinear merging phase, the evolution becomes effectively independent of the initially imposed velocity, leading to magnetic energy dissipation consistent with a normalized reconnection rate $\sim 0.1$. Our results have important implications for explosive release of magnetic energy in magnetospheres of compact objects and their surroundings.</description>

Abstract: We construct the first binary black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. The attractive force between the two black holes is balanced by the addition of a background electric field, sourced at the conformal boundary. There is a continuous family of bulk solutions for a given boundary profile and temperature, suggesting there is continuous non-uniqueness. We investigate the charges of the solutions and verify numerically that they satisfy a first law of black hole mechanics relation.</description>

Abstract: We determine the symmetries of four different theories: I) Galilean Electrodynamics (GED), II) GED coupled to 5 free static scalar fields, III) Galilean Yang-Mills (GYM), and IV) GYM coupled to 5 interacting scalar fields. We correct some old results in the literature, by finding that the symmetries of GED in a spacetime of generic dimension $d+1$ is always infinite dimensional, and in $3+1$ they correspond to the conformal Milne algebra extended by a spatial dilatation generator, which we call $D_x$. Finally, we comment on how these results fit into the framework of the non-relativistic AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic multipole expansions and the logarithmic soft photon theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the general structure of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of spatial infinity. Starting from the general solution of the sourced Maxwell equations written in terms of multipole moments as obtained by Iyer and Damour, we derive the expansion of the electromagnetic field perturbatively in the electromagnetic coupling. At leading order, where the effect of long-range Coulombic interactions between charged particles is neglected, we discover infinite sets of antipodal matching relations satisfied by the electromagnetic field, which extend and sometimes correct previously known relations. At next-to-leading order, electromagnetic tails resulting from these Coulombic interactions appear, which affect the antipodal matching relations beyond those equivalent to the leading soft photon theorem. Moreover, new antipodal matching relations arise, which we use to re-derive the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem of Sahoo and Sen. Our analysis largely builds upon that of Campiglia and Laddha, although it invalidates the antipodal matching relation which they originally used in their derivation. The antipodal matching relations and the proof of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem agree with an earlier analysis of Bhatkar, which we generalize using other methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for demonstrating equivalences beyond the saddlepoint approximation between quantities in quantum gravity that are defined by the Euclidean path integral, without assumptions about holographic duality. The method involves three ingredients: (1) a way of resolving the identity with an overcomplete basis of microstates that is under semiclassical control, (2) a drastic simplification of the sum over topologies in the limit where the basis is infinitely overcomplete, and (3) a way of cutting and splicing geometries to demonstrate equality between two different gravitational path integrals even if neither can be explicitly computed. We illustrate our methods by giving a general argument that the thermal partition function of quantum gravity with two boundaries factorises. One implication of our results is that universes containing a horizon can sometimes be understood as superpositions of horizonless geometries entangled with a closed universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sine dilaton gravity is holographically related to DSSYK. We explain how to interpret sine dilaton as 2d quantum cosmology. This paves the way for using two copies of DSSYK as hologram for Big-Bang cosmologies. We study the most basic cosmological observable: the sphere amplitude. Via canonical quantization we find a finite answer that matches the on-shell action of a dual matrix integral. The sphere amplitude (or the norm of the no-boundary wavefunction) also gives a prediction for the universe's size. In the context of slow-roll inflation, the no-boundary state is non-normalizable, and predicts a small universe, in contradiction with experiments. We argue that an avatar of these issues exists in dS JT gravity. By considering sine dilaton as a UV completion of dS JT gravity, the state becomes normalizable. We then consider the observer's no-boundary state and show that this prefers neither small nor large universes. The resulting distribution is flat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the kernels and the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure counterterms for the one-loop bispectrum of dark matter and of biased tracers in real and redshift space. This requires the expansion of biased tracers up to fourth order in fluctuations. In the process, we encounter several subtleties related to renormalization. One is the fact that, in renormalizing the momentum, a local counterterm contributes non-locally. A second subtlety is related to the renormalization of local products of the velocity fields, which need to be expressed in terms of the renormalized velocity in order to preserve Galilean symmetry. We check that the counterterms we identify are necessary and sufficient to renormalize the one-loop bispectrum at leading and subleading order in the derivative expansion. The kernels that we originally present here have already been used for the first analyses of the one-loop bispectrum in BOSS data [1, 2].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a string-net construction of a modular functor whose algebraic input is a pivotal bicategory; this extends the standard construction based on a spherical fusion category. An essential ingredient in our construction is a graphical calculus for pivotal bicategories, which we express in terms of a category of colored corollas. The globalization of this calculus to oriented surfaces yields the bicategorical string-net spaces as colimits. We show that every rigid separable Frobenius functor between strictly pivotal bicategories induces linear maps between the corresponding bicategorical string-net spaces that are compatible with the mapping class group actions and with sewing. Our results are inspired by and have applications to the description of correlators in two-dimensional conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Halo Formation from Yukawa Forces in the Very Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If long-range attractive forces exist and are stronger than gravity then cosmic halo formation can begin in the radiation-dominated era. We study a simple realization of this effect in a system where dark matter fermions have Yukawa interactions mediated by scalar particles, analogous to the Higgs boson in the standard model. We develop a self-consistent description of the system including exact background dynamics of the scalar field, and precise modelling of the fermion density fluctuations. For the latter, we provide accurate approximations for the linear growth as well as quantitative modelling of the nonlinear evolution using N-body simulations. We find that halo formation occurs exponentially fast and on scales substantially larger than simple estimates predict. The final fate of these halos remains uncertain, but could be annihilation, dark stars, primordial black holes, or even the existence of galaxy-sized halos at matter-radiation equality. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of mapping scalar-mediated interactions onto structure formation outcomes and constraints for beyond the standard model theories.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency with De Sitter Spacetime in a New Approach to Gravitational Particle Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the recent Physical Review Letter [1] which presents a new mechanism for particle production and black hole evaporation through a spatially dependent temperature. This new temperature is comparable to the Hawking result near the black hole, but is very small far away, and therefore could be a small correction. Here we apply the proposed reasoning to the case of de Sitter space, finding that it over predicts the de Sitter temperature of a minimally coupled scalar by factor of $\approx 4.3$ and over predicts the particle production rate by a factor of $\approx 52$. For non-minimally coupled scalars, it has other various problems; it predicts a negative particle production for conformal, or nearly conformal, coupled scalars; it predicts unsuppressed productions of heavy scalars. This all demonstrates an inconsistency in the proposed formalism.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09261v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-smooth Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation are constructed. The construction occurs in a finite periodic volume $\mathbb{T}^3$. The entropyp roduction maximizing solutions are selected.
  Part I of this paper defines the entropy principle and using it, finds improved regularity for the Navier-Stokes solutions.
  Part II concerns initial data and its achievability as a limit of the small time data.
  Part III establishes analyticity properties of the Part II solution; Part IV demonstrates blowup in finite time.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Discriminants of Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recurring task in particle physics and statistics is to compute the complex critical points of a product of powers of affine-linear functions. The logarithmic discriminant characterizes exponents for which such a function has a degenerate critical point in the corresponding hyperplane arrangement complement. We study properties of this discriminant, exploiting its connection with the Hurwitz form of a reciprocal linear space.</description>

      <title>Revisiting semiclassical effective dynamics for quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revise the technique of semiclassical effective dynamics, in particular reexamining the evaluation of Poisson structure of the so-called central moments capturing quantum corrections, providing a systematic, pedagogical, and efficient algorithm for evaluation of said structure. The resulting closed formulae for Poisson brackets involve less summatios than recent results in the literature, thus being more optimal for applications. Found formulae are then applied to a general class of isotropic cosmological models with locally observable configuration variables for the admitted matter fields. In particular, this allowed to formulate a consistent and nontrivial limit or fiducial cell (infrared regulator) removal for models describing spatially noncompact spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Wigner multiplets in QFT: dark sector and CPT-violating scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classification of elementary particles based on unitary irreducible representations of the Poincare group has been a cornerstone of modern Quantum Field Theory (QFT). While the Standard Model (SM) does not inherently include Dark Matter (DM), any fundamental DM candidate should still conform to this classification or its extensions. Beyond the standard representations, Wigner introduced a class of nontrivial states characterized by an additional discrete degree of freedom, known as the Wigner degeneracy. We systematically investigate the QFT of such Wigner degenerate multiplets, particularly focusing on the massive spin-1/2 case. We construct a theoretical framework where the two-fold Wigner spinor fields, $\psi_{\pm\frac{1}{2}}(x)$, form a doublet representation. We analyze their transformation properties under discrete symmetries (C, P, and T), revealing novel mixing effects due to Wigner degeneracy and an emergent accidental U(2) global symmetry. Furthermore, we explore their Yukawa and gauge interactions, demonstrating that such interactions generally break the CPT symmetry. However, we derive conditions for the CPT conservation and discuss potential phenomenological consequences beyond the SM. These results provide new insights into the possible role of Wigner-degenerate states in fundamental physics, particularly in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Can spacetime fluctuations generate entanglement between co-moving accelerated detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies [Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 03LT01 (2025); Phys. Rev. D 111, 045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of former Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in shifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift parameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift parameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a set-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find that if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get infinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this entanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift parameter, provided it is non-vanishing. Further we observe the vanishing of mutual information and discord. It implies the absence of both classical and non-classical correlations which are not related to entanglement. We investigate the dependence of entanglement on acceleration of the detectors. The present study indicates that the entanglement between two detectors, moving on the same Rindler wedge, is possible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations can lead to entanglement between detectors, moving along same classical trajectory. Hence we feel that such theoretical prediction has potential to probe the Planck length nature of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Black hole absorption cross sections: Spin and Regge poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption of massless scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields propagating in the Schwarzschild black hole geometry. Using complex angular momentum techniques, we first derive a representation of the absorption cross section that separates it into smooth background integrals and a discrete Regge pole series. This decomposition reveals the physical mechanisms underlying black hole absorption, including classical capture, surface wave interference near the photon sphere, and subleading background effects. We then construct a refined high-frequency analytical approximation that captures both the dominant oscillations and the fine structure of the absorption spectra for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational fields, incorporating spin-dependent phase corrections and higher-order effects. In addition, we provide a simplified expression that generalizes the sinc approximation to describe the leading oscillations for electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Our analysis offers a unified semiclassical interpretation of black hole absorption, combining geometric optics, surface wave dynamics, and resonant phenomena encoded by the Regge pole structure.</description>

      <title>Eye of the vortex: bound spectra in tunable horizonless rotational analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the bound spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we utilize an analog vortex endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the spacetime of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon--characteristic of an acoustic black hole--for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the latter case, where the vortex flow is purely rotational, and compute the spectral properties of the analog system. The resulting bound-state spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of superfluid Helium giant quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime geometry used here holds significant potential to replicate the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the physical topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</description>
