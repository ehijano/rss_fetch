      <title>End-to-end physics-based modeling of laser-activated color centers in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers are among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing. Central requirements for their practical applications include controlled and efficient local activation in nanophotonic devices and identical spectral features. However, producing color centers in a controlled and reliable way is inherently challenging due to the lack of comprehensive theoretical insights into their formation and the difficulty of streamlining the generation process for rapid in-situ optimization. We address these challenges by developing an end-to-end first-principles model that captures the underlying formation process of color centers. Emitters are activated through laser annealing, which allows for in-situ creation and the possibility of model-based control. Notably, our model enables the estimation of the emitters' inhomogeneous broadening down to 16 GHz in bare silicon, which translates into the creation of emitters with highly similar spectral properties. Finally, we address the challenge of in-situ deterministic activation of color centers in nanophotonic devices by going beyond bare silicon and demonstrating successful laser writing in photonic crystal optical cavities. These results lay the foundation for deterministic and large-scale integration of color centers within quantum photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Iterative Refinement of Arbitrary Micro-Optical Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an adaptive optical refinement method enabling ultra-precise micro-milling of arbitrary surfaces. Through repeated iteration, our method reduces surface error without requiring significant specific surface engineering. This remediates the long sample preparation times and lack of refinement capability that previously reported methods suffer from. The iterative refinement milling method was used to produce spherical mirrors with small radii of curvature and low surface roughness for use in micro Fabry-Perot cavities. We demonstrate the use of this adaptive process to produce a variety of arbitrary surface geometries on both optical fiber tips as well as optical flats. We additionally discuss our capability to apply iterative refinement milling adaptively to various materials, including to construct GRIN lenses.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a `digital twin' physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of ultra-smooth, high aspect ratio, sub-10 nanometer nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic and versatile approaches to sample preparation on nanoscopic scales are important in many fields including photonics, electronics, biology and material science. However, challenges exist in meeting many nanostructuring demands--particularly in emerging optical materials and component architectures. Here, we report a nanofabrication workflow that overcomes long-standing challenges in deterministic and top-down sample preparation procedures. The salient feature is a carbon mask with a low sputter yield that can be readily shaped using high resolution electron beam processing techniques. When combined with focused ion beam processing, the masking technique yields structures with ultra-smooth, near-vertical side walls. We target different material platforms to showcase the broad utility of the technique. As a first test case, we prepared nanometric gaps in evaporated Au. Gap widths of 7 plus/minus 2 nm, aspect ratios of 17, and line edge roughness values of 3sigma = 2.04 nm are achieved. Furthermore, the gap widths represent an order of magnitude improvement on system resolution limits. As a second test case, we designed and fabricated dielectric resonators in the ternary compounds MnPSe3 and NiPS3; a class of van der Waals material resistant to chemical etch approaches. Nanoantenna arrays with incrementally increasing diameter were fabricated in crystalline, exfoliated flakes. The optical response was measured by dark field spectroscopy and is in agreement with simulations. The workflow reported here leverages established techniques in material processing without the need for custom or specialized hardware. It is broadly applicable to functional materials and devices, and extends high speed focused ion beam milling to true sub-10 nm length scales.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical polarisation texturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Left and right circularly polarized transverse electromagnetic waves propagate at slightly different speeds in a magnetic material leading to a polarization rotation by an amount proportional to the projection of the magnetic field along the direction of the wave propagation. We show how this magneto-optical effect can serve as a vectorial polarization shaper if the input mode is either a radially-polarised or an azimuthally-polarised Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode. The specific polarization map of the output field can be achieved by choosing appropriately the magnetic material and/or its geometry. We show further that when the LG beam waist is comparable to the wavelength the fields are no longer purely transverse but acquire an additional longitudinal (axial) component. We demonstrate how this modifies the polarisation texturing.</description>

      <title>A spatial mode description of robust states of structured light through complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light's spatial degree of freedom is emerging as a potential resource for a myriad of applications, in both classical and quantum domains, including secure communication, sensing and imaging. However, it has been repeatedly shown that a complex medium (atmosphere, optical fibre, turbid media, etc.) can perturb the spatial amplitude, phase and polarization of the structured light fields leading to a degradation in their performance. A promising solution to this is the use of invariant modes to whom the medium appears transparent. While the creation and robustness of these modes has been experimentally demonstrated, they are difficult to implement in many important applications due to large channel matrices, a susceptibility to numerical artefacts, non-physical solutions and unreliable performance. In this work, we outline a procedure for determining these invariant modes using a modal basis, which results in a set of eigenmodes that are free of these issues, are consistently realisable and require a much smaller channel matrix to compute. Using atmospheric turbulence and LG modes as the underlying basis as an illustrative example, we find robust modes for a variety of turbulence strengths with a basis of only 231 modes, one order of magnitude smaller than previous approaches. These modes consistently show a fidelity of above 80% after propagating through the complex channel, a significant improvement over sending the individual LG modes themselves and reveal an invariant modal spectrum through the channel. Our approach will work for any complex medium and modal basis, paving the way for the effective implementation of the eigenmode approach in real-world situations.</description>

      <title>Mie-resonant silicon waveguide for efficient coupling with excitonic emitters in InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancement of radiative coupling efficiency between out-of-plane excitonic emitters in an indium selenide (InSe) film and an integrated waveguide formed by silicon (Si) Mie-resonant nanodisks is experimentally studied. Photoluminescence power at the resonant waveguide output is increased by~2.5 times at 950~nm in comparison with the case of a conventional rib waveguide of the same geometrical parameters due to the efficient excitation of Mie-type magnetic dipole resonances in individual nanoparticles. These results show inspiring possibilities for creating new on-chip light emitters for various integrated photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable liquid-crystal metasurfaces with patterned birefringence and dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light propagation through artificially patterned anisotropic materials, such as dielectric metasurfaces, enables precise control of the spatio-vectorial properties of optical fields using highly transparent, thin, and flat optical elements. Liquid-crystal cells are a common realization of such devices. Optical losses are typically assumed to be polarization-independent and are therefore often overlooked in modeling these systems. In this work, we introduce electrically tunable liquid-crystal metasurfaces with patterned birefringence and dichroism, achieved by incorporating dichroic dye molecules into the liquid-crystal mixture. These dye molecules align with the liquid crystal, effectively coupling birefringence and dichroism effects. The behavior of these metasurfaces is described using non-unitary Jones matrices, validated through polarimetric measurements. In the case of devices that are patterned to form polarization gratings, we also characterize the diffraction efficiency as a function of the dichroism and birefringence parameters, which can be tuned jointly by applying an electric field across the cell. This study not only introduces a new class of optical components but also deepens our understanding of light propagation through anisotropic materials, where dichroism can naturally arise from bulk material properties or from reflection and transmission laws at their interfaces.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Dimensional Cathodoluminescence Detector with 3D Printed Micro-Optics on a Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence, i.e. the radiation caused by the interaction of high-energy electron beams with matter, has gained a major interest in the analysis of minerals, semiconductors, and plasmonic resonances in nanoparticles. This radiation can either be coherent or incoherent, depending on the underlying interaction mechanism of electrons with nanostructured matter. Thanks to their high spatial resolution and large spectral excitation bandwidth, the evanescent near-field of a moving electron in a scanning electron microscope is used to probe locally photonic modes at the nanoscale, e.g., exciton or plasmon polaritons. The properties of these excitations can be analyzed through both spectral and temporal statistics of the emitted light. Here, we report on the technical design and implementation of a novel fiber-based cathodoluminescence detector for a scanning electron microscope. Moreover, we present first characterization measurements to prove the ability for raster scanning the cathodoluminescence emission using optical fibers with 3D printed micro-optics. The functionality and flexibility of this fiber-based detector is highlighted by resolving the spatial far-field distribution of the excited light, as well as cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting. Our findings pave the way for a better understanding of the characteristic of the light emitted from electron beams interacting with nanostructures and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation Force and Torque on Moving Nanostructures with Anisotropic Optical Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale objects moving relative to a thermal radiation bath experience a drag force due to the imbalance in their interaction with the blue- and redshifted components of the electromagnetic field. Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure. This work unveils the intricate dynamics of anisotropic nanostructures moving in a thermal radiation bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution is central to the modular scaling of quantum processors and establishing quantum networks. Color centers with telecom-band transitions and long spin coherence times are suitable candidates for long-distance entanglement distribution. However, high-bandwidth memory-enhanced quantum communication is limited by high-yield, scalable creation of efficient spin-photon interfaces. Here, we develop a silicon photonics platform consisting of arrays of bus-coupled cavities. The coupling to a common bus waveguide enables simultaneous access to individually addressable cavity-enhanced T center arrays. We demonstrate frequency-multiplexed operation of two T centers in separate photonic crystal cavities. In addition, we investigate the cavity enhancement of a T center through hybridized modes formed between physically distant cavities. Our results show that bus-coupled arrays of cavity-enhanced color centers could enable efficient on-chip and long-distance entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>Transition from non-ergodic to ergodic dynamics in an autonomous discrete time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an autonomous system of two coupled single-mode cavities, one of which interacts with a multimode resonator. We demonstrate that for small coupling strengths between single-mode cavities, the Loschmidt echo oscillates periodically in time and spontaneous breaking of time translation symmetry takes place. The Loschmidt echo behavior is an indication of the non-ergodic nature of the system when its evolution is time-reversible. In this regime, the system retains a memory of the initial state under the action of small perturbations. This behavior reveals the presence of a time crystalline order in the autonomous system. An increase in the coupling strength leads to a transition from periodic oscillations to an exponential decay in time of the Loschmidt echo. This corresponds to the transition from non-ergodic to ergodic behavior in the system. We demonstrate that the transition from non-ergodic to ergodic system's behavior can also be observed when changing the number of degrees of freedom in the resonator, which is achieved by changing its length.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the amplitudes of ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$ using femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin fluctuations are an important issue for the design and operation of future spintronic devices. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) was recently applied to detect ultrafast magnetization fluctuations. FemNoC gives direct access to the spontaneous fluctuations of the magnetization in magnetically ordered materials. In FemNoC experiments, the magnetic fluctuations are imprinted on the polarization state of two independent femtosecond probe pulses upon transmission through a magnetic sample. Using a subharmonic demodulation scheme, the cross-correlation of the signals from both pulse trains is calculated. Here, we quantitatively link the FemNoC output signal to an optical polarization rotation, and then in turn to the magnitude of the inherent spin fluctuations. To this end, three different calibration protocols are presented and compared in accuracy. Ultimately, we quantitatively determine both the variance of optical polarization noise in rad$^2$, and that of the ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in (A/m)$^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabry-P\'erot etalons are widely used for laser frequency control. Inserting them in laser cavities imparts unavoidable walk-off loss and reduces the output power. Here, we treat the technology-relevant case of the walk-off loss of an etalon in a unidirectional ring cavity, which is a standard design of single-frequency lasers. We provide the theory background by discussing the analytic limits. The loss can be efficiently minimized by realignment, or by proper matching of the etalon's surface reflectivity with its refractive index. We numerically calculate the loss in the region uncovered by the analytic limits. We discuss practical laser design considerations, and we perform a tilt-tuning experiment in a single-frequency, solid-state laser setup.</description>

      <title>Reproducible generation of green-emitting color centers in hBN using oxygen annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to generate quantum emitters with reproducible properties in solid-state matrices is crucial for quantum technologies. Here, we show that a high density of close-to-identical single-photon emitters can be created in commercial hexagonal boron nitride using annealing under oxygen atmosphere. This simple procedure yields a uniform in-plane distribution of color centers consistently emitting around 539.4 nm, with a wavelength spread smaller than 1 nm. We present an extensive characterization of their photophysical properties, showing that the emitters are bright and stable, and exhibit narrow lines at low temperatures with minimal spectral diffusion. These characteristics make this family of quantum emitters highly appealing for applications to quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Raman scattering in layered AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$: Helical modes and excitation energy-dependent intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural anisotropy in layered two-dimensional materials can lead to highly anisotropic optical absorption which, in turn, can profoundly a^ect their phonon modes. These e^ects include lattice orientation-dependent and excitation energy-dependent mode intensities that can enable new phononic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we report anomalous Raman spectra in single-crystalline AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$, a layered antiferromagnetic material. Density functional theory calculations and experimental measurements reveal several unique features in the Raman spectra of bulk and exfoliated AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ crystals including three helical vibrational modes. These modes exhibit large Raman optical activities (circular intensity di^erences) in bulk AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$, which progressively decrease with thickness. We also observe strong excitation energy dependent peak intensities as well as a decrease in anti-Stokes peak intensities at room temperature with increasing excitation energy, resulting in an apparent cooling by up to 220 K. All of these anomalies in bulk and exfoliated flakes are attributed to the unique ABC layer stacking structure of AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ and to the smaller unit cell volume that causes hybridization between the Se and Ag/Cr electron densities, resulting in charge transfer and strongly a^ecting the electron-phonon coupling. This work thus positions AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ as an exciting new 2D material for optical and phononic applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Orientations of and Angular Separation between a Pair of Dipole Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that it is impossible to distinguish two spatially coinciding fluorescent molecules from a single rotating molecule using polarization-sensitive imaging, even if one modulates the polarization of the illumination or the detection dipole-spread function (DSF). If the target is known to be a dipole pair, existing imaging methods perform poorly for measuring their angular separation. We propose simultaneously modulating the excitation polarization and DSF, which demonstrates robust discrimination between dipole pairs versus single molecules. Our method improves the precision of measuring centroid orientation by 50% and angular separation by 2- to 4-fold over existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Integrating high-precision and fringe-scale displacement sensing using heterodyne cavity-tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a heterodyne stabilized cavity-based interferometer scheme that can serve as a compact and high-sensitivity displacement sensor with a fringe-scale operating range. The technique, in principle, can reach a sub-femtometer noise floor and an operating range on the order of one laser wavelength at $\lambda \approx 1\,\mu m$. With our current experimental setup, we achieve a sensitivity of about $260 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $1\,Hz$ and $46 fm/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at around $130\,Hz$. By probing a length actuated cavity, we demonstrate six orders of magnitude of dynamic range for displacement measurement, reaching a maximum motion of $0.15\,\mu m$. The tracking bandwidth and displacement range are limited by analog effects in the signal digitization and are extendable in the future.</description>

      <title>Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned discrete axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial "zones" with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our "zoned discrete axisymmetry" (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Estimation of the Stokes Vector Rotation for a General Polarimetric Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical polarimetry is a well-established discipline with diverse applications across different branches of science. The burgeoning interest in leveraging quantum resources to achieve highly sensitive measurements has spurred researchers to elucidate the behavior of polarized light within a quantum mechanical framework, thereby fostering the development of a quantum theory of polarimetry. In this work, drawing inspiration from polarimetric investigations in biological tissues, we investigate the precision limits of polarization rotation angle estimation about a known rotation axis, in a quantum polarimetric process, comprising three distinct quantum channels. The rotation angle to be estimated is induced by the retarder channel on the Stokes vector of the probe state. The diattenuator and depolarizer channels, acting on the probe state, can be thought of as effective noise processes. We explore the precision constraints inherent in quantum polarimetry by evaluating the quantum Fisher information for probe states of significance in quantum metrology, namely NOON, Kings of Quantumness, and Coherent states. The effects of the noise channels as well as their ordering is analyzed on the estimation error of the rotation angle to characterize practical and optimal quantum probe states for quantum polarimetry. Furthermore, we propose an experimental framework tailored for NOON state quantum polarimetry, aiming to bridge theoretical insights with empirical validation.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality enhanced precision in quantum polarimetry via entangled photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonlocal quantum approach is presented to polarimetry, leveraging the phenomenon of entanglement in photon pairs to enhance the precision in sample property determination. By employing two distinct channels, one containing the sample of interest and the other serving as a reference, the conditions are explored under which the inherent correlation between entangled photons can increase measurement sensitivity. Specifically, we calculate the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and compare the accuracy and sensitivity for the cases of single sample channel versus two channel quantum state tomography measurements. The theoretical results are verified by experimental analysis. The theoretical and experimental framework demonstrates that the nonlocal strategy enables enhanced precision and accuracy in extracting information about sample characteristics more than the local measurements. Depending on the chosen estimators and noise channels present, theoretical and experimental results show that noise-induced bias decreases the precision for the estimated parameter. Such a quantum-enhanced nonlocal polarimetry holds promise for advancing diverse fields including material science, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing, via high-precision measurements through quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Effects of phase-gradient on the nonadiabatic dynamics and photon-phonon conversion in one-dimensional array of optomechanical cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulation of photonic and phononic coupling in the coupled resonators plays a crucial role in nonreciprocal devices and quantum transduction. In this work, we theoretically investigated how the phase of a driving laser introduces the phase-dependent coupling between photonic and phononic modes and affects the nonadiabatic dynamics of the eigenmodes and photon-phonon conversion in an array of coupled optomechanical cavities. We analyze the band structure of eigenmodes and show that the quick transfer of population between the eigenmodes takes place at the minimum energy gap, which can also be controlled via phase of the driving laser. We further show that the eigenmodes constitute the superposition of photonic and phononic modes, resulting from the optomechanical coupling between these modes. Moreover, the phase also enables the switching of the relative weights of photons and phonons in the eigenmodes. Finally, we investigate the effects of phase on the coherent conversion of photon-phonon in a finite-size array.</description>

      <title>Protecting Intercavity Polaritons in Strongly Coupled Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Two-photon interference between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals scattered off a semiconductor quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) ultimately determines the bandwidth it can offer for quantum information processing. However, no prior experiment has so far been performed to examine the effect of driving detuning on indistinguishability of photons scattered off a TLE, a parameter that is crucial for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference experiments between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. Our results suggest that indistinguishability among photons scattered off a quantum dot is inherently insensitive to the driving laser's detuning, as straightforwardly predicted by the resonance fluorescence model that systematically treats all scattered photons as spontaneous emission.</description>
