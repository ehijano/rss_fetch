      <title>A detailed dive into fitting strategies for GRB afterglows with contamination: A case study with kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows have begun to readily reveal contamination from a kilonova or a supernova. This contamination presents significant challenges towards traditional methods of inferring the properties of these phenomena from observations. Given current knowledge of kilonova and afterglow modelling, observations (as expected) with near-infrared bands and at early observing times provide the greatest diagnostic power for both observing the presence of a kilonova and inferences on its properties in gamma-ray burst afterglows. However, contemporaneous observations in radio and X-ray are critical for reducing the afterglow parameter space and for more efficient parameter estimation. We compare different methods for fitting joint kilonova and afterglow observations under different scenarios. We find that ignoring the contribution of one source (even in scenarios where the source is sub-dominant) can lead to significantly biased estimated parameters but could still produce great light curve fits that do not raise suspicion. This bias is also present for analyses that fit data where one source is "subtracted". In most scenarios, the bias is smaller than the systematic uncertainty inherent to kilonova models but significant for afterglow parameters, particularly in the absence of high-quality radio and X-ray observations. Instead, we show that the most reliable method for inference in any scenario where contamination can not be confidently dismissed is to jointly fit for both an afterglow and kilonova/supernova, and showcase a Bayesian framework to make this joint analysis computationally feasible.</description>

      <title>ARA-Next: a new DAQ and trigger architecture for the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment aims to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos (&gt;10 PeV) using radio detection techniques. To enhance ARA's capabilities, a new RFSoC-based DAQ, ARA-Next, is in the early stages of development. This advanced system will facilitate the creation of sophisticated triggers, including a novel multi-trigger approach, similar to those used in collider experiments. Our approach involves crafting and implementing innovative triggers for ARA's new DAQ, such as identifying double pulses from potential in-ice neutrino interactions, utilizing templates for atmospheric cosmic ray signals, optimizing triggers for astrophysical neutrino sources, correlating special events between ARA and IceCube, and discerning anthropogenic events using directional information. These trigger designs aim to lower thresholds and enhance ARA's detector sensitivity. Overall, this upgrade will not only enhance ARA's capabilities but also contribute to the technological advancements necessary for future experiments of this nature.</description>

      <title>The early radio afterglow of short GRB 230217A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the radio afterglow of short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 230217A, which was detected less than 1 day after the gamma-ray prompt emission with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The ATCA rapid-response system automatically triggered an observation of GRB 230217A following its detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and began observing the event just 32 minutes post-burst at 5.5 and 9 GHz for 7 hours. Dividing the 7-hour observation into three time-binned images allowed us to obtain radio detections with logarithmic central times of 1, 2.8 and 5.2 hours post-burst, the first of which represents the earliest radio detection of any GRB to date. The decline of the light curve is consistent with reverse shock emission if the observing bands are below the spectral peak and not affected by synchrotron self-absorption. This makes GRB 230217A the fifth short GRB with radio detections attributed to a reverse shock at early times ($&lt;1$ day post-burst). Following brightness temperature arguments, we have used our early radio detections to place the highest minimum Lorentz factor (${\Gamma}_{min} &gt; 50$ at $\sim1$ hour) constraints on a GRB in the radio band. Our results demonstrate the importance of rapid radio follow-up observations with long integrations and good sensitivity for detecting the fast-evolving radio emission from short GRBs and probing their reverse shocks.</description>

      <title>An Integral-Based Technique (IBT) to Accelerate the Monte-Carlo Radiative Transfer Computation for Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an integral-based technique (IBT) algorithm to accelerate supernova (SN) radiative transfer calculations. The algorithm utilizes ``integral packets'', which are calculated by the path integral of the Monte-Carlo energy packets, to synthesize the observed spectropolarimetric signal at a given viewing direction in a 3-D time-dependent radiative transfer program. Compared to the event-based technique (EBT) proposed by (Bulla et al. 2015), our algorithm significantly reduces the computation time and increases the Monte-Carlo signal-to-noise ratio. Using a 1-D spherical symmetric type Ia supernova (SN Ia) ejecta model DDC10 and its derived 3-D model, the IBT algorithm has successfully passed the verification of: (1) spherical symmetry; (2) mirror symmetry; (3) cross comparison on a 3-D SN model with direct-counting technique (DCT) and EBT. Notably, with our algorithm implemented in the 3-D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code SEDONA, the computation time is faster than EBT by a factor of $10-30$, and the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is better by a factor of $5-10$, with the same number of Monte-Carlo quanta.</description>

      <title>Parameter constraints for accreting millisecond pulsars with synthetic NICER data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse profile modelling (PPM) is a technique for inferring mass, radius and hotspot properties of millisecond pulsars. PPM is now regularly used for analysis of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars (RMPs) with data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). Extending PPM to accreting millisecond pulsars (AMPs) is attractive, because they are a different source class featuring bright X-ray radiation from hotspots powered by accretion. In this paper, we present a modification of one of the PPM codes, X-PSI, so that it can be used for AMPs. In particular, we implement a model of an accretion disc and atmosphere model appropriate for the hotspots of AMPs, and improve the overall computational efficiency. We then test parameter recovery with synthetic NICER data in two scenarios with reasonable parameters for AMPs. We find in the first scenario, where the hotspot is large, that we are able to tightly and accurately constrain all parameters including mass and radius. In the second scenario, which is a high inclination system with a smaller hotspot, we find degeneracy between a subset of model parameters and a slight bias in the inferred mass and radius. This analysis of synthetic data lays the ground work for future analysis of AMPs with NICER data. Such an analysis could be complemented by future (joint) analysis of polarization data from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).</description>

      <title>Follow-up of Neutron Star Mergers with CTA and Prospects for Joint Detection with Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic observations of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 marked a giant leap in multi-messenger astrophysics. The extensive observation campaign of the associated Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) and its afterglow has strengthened the hypothesis associating GRBs with BNS mergers and provided insights on mass ejection, particularly the relativistic outflow launched in BNS mergers. In this paper, we investigate the joint detection probabilities of BNS mergers by GW detectors and the upcoming ground-based very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray instrument, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Using an empirical relation that constrains the distance-inclination angle plane, we simulated BNS mergers detectable in the O5 run of the LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) network with $300$~Mpc BNS horizon. Assuming Gaussian structured jets and ignoring large sky localization challenges of GW detectors, we estimated VHE afterglow detection probability by CTA. We have explored the afterglow parameter space to identify conditions favourable for detecting synchrotron self-Compton emission by CTA. Our study reveals that events viewed at angles $\lesssim3$ times the jet core angle are detectable by CTA when the initial bulk Lorentz factor at the jet axis ranges between 100 and 800. We find high kinetic energy ($E_k&gt;10^{50}$ erg), ambient density ($n_0&gt;10^{-1}$ $cm^{-3}$), and energy content in non-thermal electrons significantly enhance the likelihood of CTA detection within 300 Mpc. The joint detection rate varies significantly with afterglow parameter distributions, ranging from $0.003$ to $0.5$ per year.</description>

      <title>MLody -- Deep Learning Generated Polarized Synchrotron Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized synchrotron emission is a fundamental process in high-energy astrophysics, particularly in the environments around black holes and pulsars. Accurate modeling of this emission requires precise computation of the emission, absorption, rotation, and conversion coefficients, which are critical for radiative transfer simulations. Traditionally, these coefficients are derived using fit functions based on precomputed ground truth values. However, these fit functions often lack accuracy, particularly in specific plasma conditions not well represented in the datasets used to generate them. In this work, we introduce ${\tt MLody}$, a deep neural network designed to compute polarized synchrotron coefficients with high accuracy across a wide range of plasma parameters. We demonstrate ${\tt MLody}$'s capabilities by integrating it with a radiative transfer code to generate synthetic polarized synchrotron images for an accreting black hole simulation. Our results reveal significant differences, up to a factor of two, in both linear and circular polarization compared to traditional methods. These differences could have important implications for parameter estimation in Event Horizon Telescope observations, suggesting that ${\tt MLody}$ could enhance the accuracy of future astrophysical analyses.</description>

      <title>uGMRT sub-GHz view of the Sausage cluster diffuse radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CIZA J2242.8+5301, or the Sausage cluster, is well studied over a range of frequencies. Since its first discovery, a lot of interesting features and unique characteristics have been uncovered. In this work, we report some more new morphological features using the uGMRT band-3 and band-4 data. In the north relic, we observe variation in spectral index profiles across the relic width from the east to west, which may indicate a decrease in downstream cooling rate in that direction. We re-confirm the presence of an additional ~ 930 kpc relic in the north. We classify the filamentary source in the downstream region to be a narrow angle tail (NAT) radio galaxy. The bright arc in the east relic shows sub-structure in the spectral index profile, which may indicate the presence of finer filaments. We further report the presence of a double-strand structure in the east relic similar to the 'Toothbrush' relic. We categorize the bright 'L' shaped structure in the southern relic to be a NAT radio galaxy, as well as trace the actual ~ 1.1 Mpc relic component. We re-confirm the existence of the faint southern extent, measuring the relic length to be ~ 1.8 Mpc. Furthermore, we suggest the southern relic to be a union of individual component relics rather than a single giant filamentary relic. Lastly, based on the morphological symmetry between northern and southern relics, we suggest a schematic shock structure associated with the merger event in an attempt to explain their formation scenario.</description>

      <title>Initial performance of the Radar Echo Telescope for Cosmic Rays, RET-CR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Radar Echo Telescope for Cosmic Rays (RET-CR), a pathfinder instrument for the radar echo method of ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino detection, was initially deployed near Summit Station, Greenland, in May 2023. After a 4 week commissioning period, 9 days of data were taken before the instrument went offline. In this article, we describe the instrument as it was deployed, and the initial performance of the detector. We show that the technical aspects of running a radar based particle cascade detector in the ice have been demonstrated. Analysis of the 2023 data informed improvements that were incorporated into the May-August 2024 deployment, which has just concluded at time of writing. Results from the 2024 run will be presented in forthcoming publications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficients for crystallized Coulomb plasmas are essential microphysics input for modeling white dwarf cores and neutron star crusts but are poorly understood. In this work we present a model for diffusion in Coulomb crystals. We show that melting and diffusion follow the same universal scaling such that diffusion is independent of screening. Our simulations show, contrary to prevailing wisdom, that the formation of vacancies is not suppressed by the large pressure. Rather, vacancy formation and hole diffusion is the dominant mode of self diffusion in Coulomb crystals.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Ionization in the Central Molecular Zone by sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the anomalous ionization rate observed in the Central Molecular Zone can be attributed to MeV dark matter annihilations into $e^+e^-$ pairs for galactic dark matter profiles with slopes $\gamma&gt;1$. The low annihilation cross-sections required avoid cosmological constraints and imply no detectable inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung or synchrotron emissions in radio, X and gamma rays. The possible connection to the source of the unexplained 511 keV line emission in the Galactic Center suggests that both observations could be correlated and have a common origin.</description>

      <title>A test of the conjectured critical black-hole formation -- null geodesic correspondence: The case of self-gravitating scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been conjectured [A. Ianniccari {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 133}, 081401 (2024)] that there exists a correspondence between the critical threshold of black-hole formation and the stability properties of null circular geodesics in the curved spacetime of the collapsing matter configuration. In the present compact paper we provide a non-trivial test of this intriguing conjecture. In particular, using analytical techniques we study the physical and mathematical properties of self-gravitating scalar field configurations that possess marginally-stable (degenerate) null circular geodesics. We reveal the interesting fact that the {\it analytically} calculated critical compactness parameter ${\cal C}^{\text{analytical}}\equiv{\text{max}_r}\{m(r)/r\}=6/25$, which signals the appearance of the first (marginally-stable) null circular geodesic in the curved spacetime of the self-gravitating scalar fields, agrees quite well (to within $\sim10\%$) with the exact compactness parameter ${\cal C}^{\text{numerical}}\equiv\text{max}_t\{\text{max}_r\{m(r)/r\}\}\simeq0.265$ which is computed {\it numerically} using fully non-linear numerical simulations of the gravitational collapse of scalar fields at the threshold of black-hole formation [here $m(r)$ is the gravitational mass contained within a sphere of radius $r$].</description>

      <title>Which is which? Identification of the two compact objects in gravitational-wave binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact objects observed in gravitational-wave astronomy so far always come in pairs and never individually. Identifying the two components of a binary system is a delicate operation that is often taken for granted. The labeling procedure (i.e. which is object "1" and which is object "2") effectively acts as systematics, or equivalently an unspecified prior, in gravitational-wave data inference. The common approach is to label the objects solely by their masses, on a sample-by-sample basis; while intuitive, this leads to degeneracies when binaries have comparable masses. Instead, we argue that object identification should be tackled using the posterior distribution as a whole. We frame the problem in terms of constrained clustering -- a flavor of semi-supervised machine learning -- and find that unfolding the labeling systematics can significantly impact, and arguably improve, our interpretation of the data. In particular, the precision of black-hole spin measurements improves by up to 50%, spurious multimodalities and tails tend to disappear, posteriors become closer to Gaussian distributions, and the identification of the nature of the object (i.e. black hole vs. neutron star) is facilitated. We estimate that about 10% of the LIGO/Virgo posterior samples are affected by this relabeling, i.e. they might have been attributed to the wrong compact object in the observed binaries.</description>

      <title>Can slow pulsars in Milky Way globular clusters form via partial recycling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alongside the population of several hundred radio millisecond pulsars currently known in Milky Way globular clusters, a subset of six slowly spinning pulsars (spin periods $0.3-4$\,s) are also observed. With inferred magnetic fields $\gtrsim 10^{11}\,$G and characteristic ages $\lesssim10^8\,$yr, explaining the formation of these apparently young pulsars in old stellar populations poses a major challenge. One popular explanation is that these objects are not actually young but instead have been partially spun up via accretion from a binary companion. In this scenario, accretion in a typical low-mass X-ray binary is interrupted by a dynamical encounter with a neighboring object in the cluster. Instead of complete spin up to millisecond spin periods, the accretion is halted prematurely, leaving behind a ``partially recycled'' neutron star. In this Letter, we use a combination of analytic arguments motivated by low-mass X-ray binary evolution and $N$-body simulations to show that this partial-recycling mechanism is not viable. Realistic globular clusters are not sufficiently dense to interrupt mass transfer on the short timescales required to achieve such slow spin periods. We argue that collapse of massive white dwarfs and/or neutron star collisions are more promising ways to form slow pulsars in old globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Merger of massive galaxy cluster CL0238.3+2005 at z~0.4: just after pericenter passage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive clusters of galaxies are very rare in the observable Universe. Even rarer are mergers of such clusters observed close to pericenter passage. Here, we report on one such case: a massive (~ $10^{15}\,M_\odot$) and hot (kT ~ 10 keV) cluster CL0238.3+2005 at $z\approx 0.42$. For this cluster, we combine X-ray data from SRG/eROSITA and Chandra, optical images from DESI, and spectroscopy from BTA and RTT-150 telescopes. The X-ray and optical morphologies suggest an ongoing merger with the projected separation of subhalos of $\sim 200$ kpc. The line-of-sight velocity of galaxies tentatively associated with the two merging halos differs by 2000-3000 km/s. We conclude that, most plausibly, the merger axis is neither close to the line of sight nor to the sky plane. We compare CL0238 with two well-known clusters MACS0416 and Bullet, and conclude that CL0238 corresponds to an intermediate phase between the pre-merging MACS0416 cluster and the post-merger Bullet cluster. Namely, this cluster has recently (only $\lesssim 0.1$ Gyr ago) experienced an almost head-on merger. We argue that this "just after" system is a very rare case and an excellent target for lensing, Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, and X-ray studies that can constrain properties ranging from dynamics of mergers to self-interacting dark matter, and plasma effects in intracluster medium that are associated with shock waves, e.g., electron-ion equilibration efficiency and relativistic particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Supernova remnants in clumpy medium: A model of hydrodynamic and radio synchrotron evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical model of $\Sigma-D$ relation for supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a clumpy medium. The model and its approximations were developed using the hydrodynamic simulations of SNRs in environments of low-density bubbles and clumpy media with different densities and volume-filling factors. For calculation of SNR luminosities we developed the synchrotron emission model, implying the test-particle approximation. The goal of this work is to explain the flattened part of $\Sigma-D$ relation for Galactic SNRs at $D\approx14-50$ pc. Our model shows that the shock collision with the clumpy medium initially enhances the brightness of individual SNRs, which is followed by a steeper fall of their $\Sigma-D$ curve. We used the analytical model to generate large SNR samples on $\Sigma-D$ plane, within a span of different densities and distances to clumpy medium, keeping the observed distribution of diameters. After comparison with the Galactic sample, we conclude that the observed $\Sigma-D$ flattening and scatter originates in sporadic emission jumps of individual SNRs while colliding with the dense clumps. Statistically, the significant impact of the clumps starts at diameters of $\approx14$ pc, up to $\sim70$ pc, with the average density jump at clumpy medium of $\sim2-20$ times, roughly depending on the low density of circumstellar region. However, additional analysis considering the selection effects is needed, as well as the improvement of the model, considering radiation losses and thermal conduction.</description>

      <title>Charting the Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Sky with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the summer of 2023, the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) announced a compelling evidence for the existence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Despite this breakthrough, however, several critical questions remain unanswered: What is the source of the signal? How can cosmic variance be accounted for? To what extent can we constrain nanohertz gravity? When will individual supermassive black hole binaries become observable? And how can we achieve a stronger detection? These open questions have spurred significant interests in PTA science, making this an opportune moment to revisit the astronomical and theoretical foundations of the field, as well as the data analysis techniques employed. In this review, we focus on the theoretical aspects of the SGWB as detected by PTAs. We provide a comprehensive derivation of the expected signal and its correlation, presented in a pedagogical manner, while also addressing current constraints. Looking ahead, we explore future milestones in the field, with detailed discussions on emerging theoretical considerations such as cosmic variance, the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions, subluminal gravitational waves, and the anisotropy and polarization of the SGWB.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos play a critical role of transporting energy and changing the lepton density within core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. The quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) combine the effects of neutrino-matter interactions treated in classical Boltzmann transport with the neutrino flavor-changing effects treated in neutrino oscillation calculations. We present a method for extending existing neutrino interaction rates to full QKE source terms for use in numerical calculations. We demonstrate the effects of absorption and emission by nucleons and nuclei, electron scattering, electron-positron pair annihilation, nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung, neutrino-neutrino scattering. For the first time, we include all these collision terms self-consistently in a simulation of the full isotropic QKEs in conditions relevant to core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. For our choice of parameters, the long-term evolution of the neutrino distribution function proceeds similarly with and without the oscillation term, though with measurable differences. We demonstrate that electron scattering, nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung processes, and four-neutrino processes dominate flavor decoherence in the protoneutron star (PNS), absorption dominates near the shock, and all of the considered processes except elastic nucleon scattering are relevant in the decoupling region. Finally, we propose an effective decoherence opacity that at most energies predicts decoherence rates to within a factor of 10 in our model PNS and within 20% outside of the PNS.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Approximate Flavor Instability Metrics in Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos can rapidly change flavor in the inner dense regions of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers due to the neutrino fast flavor instability. If the amount of flavor transformation is significant, the FFI could significantly affect how supernovae explode and how supernovae and mergers enrich the universe with heavy elements. Since many state of the art supernova and merger simulations rely on neutrino transport algorithms based on angular moments of the radiation field, there is incomplete information with which to determine if the distributions are unstable to the FFI. In this work we test the performance of several proposed moment-based instability tests in the literature. We perform time-independent general relativistic neutrino transport on a snapshot of a 3D neutron star merger simulation to generate reasonable neutrino distributions and check where each of these criteria correctly predict instability. In addition, we offer a new ``maximum entropy'' instability test that is somewhat more complex, but offers more detailed (though still approximate) estimates of ELN crossing width and depth. We find that this maximum entropy test and the resonant trajectory test are particularly accurate at predicting instability in this snapshot, though all tests predict instability where significant flavor transformation is most likely.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and spin alignment in massive, gravito-turbulent circumbinary discs around supermassive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parsec-scale separation supermassive black hole binaries in the centre of gas-rich galaxy merger remnants could be surrounded by massive circumbinary discs (CBDs). Black hole mass and spin evolution during the gas-rich binary inspiral are crucial in determining the direction and power of relativistic jets that radio observations with LOFAR and SKAO will probe, and for predicting gravitational wave (GW) emission that IPTA and LISA will measure. We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations capturing gas-rich, self-gravitating CBDs around a $2\times 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole binary, that probe different mass ratios, eccentricities and inclinations. We employ a sub-grid Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc to self-consistently model black hole mass and spin evolution together with super-Lagrangian refinement techniques to resolve gas flows, streams and mini-discs within the cavity, which play a fundamental role in torquing and feeding the binary. We find that higher mass ratio and eccentric binaries result in larger cavities, while retrograde binaries result in smaller cavities. All of the simulated binaries are expected to shrink with net gravitational torques being negative. Unlike previous simulations, we do not find preferential accretion onto the secondary black hole. This implies smaller chirp masses at coalescence and hence a weaker GW background. Critically this means that spin-alignment is faster than the binary inspiral timescale even for low mass ratios. When considering initially misaligned systems, the orientation of the mini-discs around each black hole can vary significantly. We discuss the implications of this behaviour for black hole spin alignment and highlight the need for broader parameter space studies of misaligned systems to understand the impact on black hole recoil velocities.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray diffusion in magnetic fields amplified by nonlinear turbulent dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) in turbulent magnetic fields is fundamental to understand various astrophysical processes. We explore the CR diffusion in the magnetic fluctuations amplified by the nonlinear turbulent dynamo, in the absence of a strong mean magnetic field. Using test particle simulations, we identify three distinct CR diffusion regimes: mirroring, wandering, and magnetic moment scattering (MMS). With highly inhomogeneous distribution of the dynamo-amplified magnetic fields, we find that the diffusion of CRs is also spatially inhomogeneous. Our results reveal that lower-energy CRs preferentially undergo the mirror and wandering diffusion in the strong-field regions, and the MMS diffusion in the weak-field regions. The former two diffusion mechanisms play a more important role toward lower CR energies, resulting in a relatively weak energy dependence of the overall CR mean free path. In contrast, higher-energy CRs predominantly undergo the MMS diffusion, for which the incomplete particle gyration, i.e., the limit case of mirroring, in strong fields has a more significant effect than the scattering by small-scale field tangling/reversal. Compared with lower-energy CRs, they are more poorly confined in space, and their mean free paths have a stronger energy dependence. We stress the fundamental role of magnetic field inhomogeneity of nonlinear turbulent dynamo in causing the different diffusion behavior of CRs compared to that in sub-Alfv\'enic MHD turbulence.</description>

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are subject to accelerations in globular clusters (GCs) that manifest themselves in both the first and second spin period time derivatives, and can be used to explore the mass distribution of the potentials they inhabit. Here we report on over 20 yr of pulsar timing observations of five millisecond radio pulsars in the core of the core-collapse GC NGC 6752 with the Parkes (Murriyang) and MeerKAT radio telescopes, which have allowed us to measure the proper motions, positions, and first and second time derivatives of the pulsars. The pulsar timing parameters indicate that all the pulsars in the core experience accelerations and jerks that can be explained only if an amount of nonluminous mass of at least 2.56x10^3 M_SUN is present in the core of NGC 6752. On the other hand, our studies highly disfavor the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of the cluster, with a mass equal to or greater than ~3000M_SUN.</description>

      <title>Testing the Molecular Cloud Paradigm for Ultra-High-Energy Gamma Ray Emission from the Direction of SNR G106.3+2.7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to PeV energies. SNR G106.3+2.7 is a prime PeVatron candidate. It is formed by a head region, where the pulsar J2229+6114 and its boomerang-shaped pulsar wind nebula are located, and a tail region containing SN ejecta. The lack of observed gamma ray emission from the two regions of this SNR has made it difficult to assess which region would be responsible for the PeV CRs. We aim to characterize the very-high-energy (VHE, 0.1-100 TeV) gamma ray emission from SNR G106.3+2.7 by determining the morphology and spectral energy distribution of the region. This is accomplished using 2565 days of data and improved reconstruction algorithms from the HAWC Observatory. We also explore possible gamma ray production mechanisms for different energy ranges. Using a multi-source fitting procedure based on a maximum-likelihood estimation method, we evaluate the complex nature of this region. We determine the morphology, spectrum, and energy range for the source found in the region. Molecular cloud information is also used to create a template and evaluate the HAWC gamma ray spectral properties at ultra-high-energies (UHE, &gt;56 TeV). This will help probe the hadronic nature of the highest-energy emission from the region. We resolve one extended source coincident with all other gamma ray observations of the region. The emission reaches above 100~TeV and its preferred log-parabola shape in the spectrum shows a flux peak in the TeV range. The molecular cloud template fit on the higher energy data reveals that the SNR's energy budget is fully capable of producing a purely hadronic source for UHE gamma rays.</description>

      <title>Positive and unlabelled machine learning reveals new fast radio burst repeater candidates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are astronomical radio transients of unknown origin. A minority of FRBs have been observed to originate from repeating sources, and it is unknown which apparent one-off bursts are hidden repeaters. Recent studies increasingly suggest that there are intrinsic physical differences between repeating and non-repeating FRBs. Previous research has used machine learning classification techniques to identify apparent non-repeaters with repeater characteristics, whose sky positions would be ideal targets for future observation campaigns. However, these methods have not sufficiently accounted for the positive and unlabelled (PU) nature of the data, wherein true labels are only available for repeaters. Modified techniques that do not inadvertently learn properties of hidden repeaters as characteristic of non-repeaters are likely to identify additional repeater candidates with greater accuracy. We present in this paper the first known attempt at applying PU-specific machine learning techniques to study FRBs. We train an ensemble of five PU-specific classifiers on the available data and use them to identify 66 repeater candidates in burst data from the CHIME/FRB collaboration, 18 of which were not identified with the use of machine learning classifiers in past research. Our results additionally support repeaters and non-repeaters having intrinsically different physical properties, particularly spectral index, frequency width, and burst width. This work additionally opens new possibilities to study repeating and non-repeating FRBs using the framework of PU learning.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent intrinsic time delay of gamma-ray bursts on testing Lorentz invariance violation</title>

Abstract: High-energy photons of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) might be emitted at different intrinsic times with energy dependence at the source. In this letter, we expand the model from previous works on testing the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LV) with the observed GRB data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We reanalyze the previous data with the full Bayesian parameter estimation method and get consistent results by assuming that the time delays are due to an LV term and a constant intrinsic time delay term. Subsequently, we neglect the LV effect and only consider the intrinsic time delay effect. We assume a common intrinsic time delay term along with a source energy correlated time delay of high-energy photons. We find that the energy-dependent emission times can also explain the observed GRB data of high-energy photon events. Finally, we integrate these two physical mechanisms into a unified model to distinguish and evaluate their respective contributions using the observed GRB data.</description>

      <title>Iterative extraction of overtones from black hole ringdown</title>

Abstract: Extraction of multiple quasinormal modes from ringdown gravitational waves emitted from a binary black hole coalescence is a touchstone to test whether a remnant black hole is described by the Kerr spacetime in general relativity. However, it is not straightforward to check the consistency between the ringdown signal and the quasinormal mode frequencies predicted by the linear perturbation theory. While the longest-lived mode can be extracted in a stable manner, the higher overtones damp more quickly and hence the fitting of overtones tends to end up with the overfit. To improve the extraction of overtones, we propose an iterative procedure consisting of fitting and subtraction of the longest-lived mode of the ringdown waveform in the time domain. Through the analyses of the mock waveform and numerical relativity waveform, we clarify that the iterative procedure allows us to extract the overtones in a more stable manner.</description>

      <title>Testing the Boundary-to-Bound Correspondence with Numerical Relativity</title>

Abstract: The Boundary-to-Bound (B2B) correspondence, which connects orbital and radiative observables between bound and unbound orbits, has recently been introduced and demonstrated in the perturbative regime. We produce a large number of numerical relativity simulations of bound and unbound encounters between two nonspinning equal mass black holes in order to test this correspondence in the non-perturbative regime. We focus on testing the radiated energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital parameters such as the period and periastron advance. We find that, across a wide range of eccentricities, the B2B relationships do not hold in the non-perturbative regime, thereby placing a clear limit on the applicability of these relationships. We also approximate the separatrix between bound and unbound relativistic encounters as a function of their initial energies and angular momenta.</description>

      <title>White dwarf eccentricity fluctuation and dissipation by AGB convection</title>

Abstract: Millisecond pulsars with white dwarf companions have typical eccentricities $e\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-3}$. The eccentricities of helium white dwarfs are explained well by applying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to convective eddies in their red giant progenitors. We extend this theory to more massive carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs with asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitors. Due to the radiation pressure in AGB stars, the dominant factor in determining the remnant white dwarf's eccentricity is the critical residual hydrogen envelope mass $m_{\rm env}$ required to inflate the star to giant proportions. Using a suite of MESA stellar evolution simulations with $\Delta m_{\rm c}=10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ core-mass intervals, we resolved the AGB thermal pulses and found that the critical $m_{\rm env}\propto m_{\rm c}^{-6}$. The resulting eccentricity $e\sim 3\times 10^{-3}$ is almost independent of the remnant CO white dwarf's mass $m_{\rm c}$. Nearly all of the measured eccentricities lie below this robust theoretical limit, indicating that the eccentricity is damped during the common-envelope inspiral that follows the unstable Roche-lobe overflow of the AGB star. Specifically, we focused on white dwarfs with median masses $m_{\rm c}&gt;0.6\,{\rm M}_\odot$. These massive white dwarfs begin their inspiral with practically identical orbital periods and eccentricities, eliminating any dependence on the initial conditions. For this sub-sample, we find an empirical relation $e\propto P^{3/2}$ between the final period and eccentricity that is much tighter than previous studies - motivating theoretical work on the eccentricity evolution during the common envelope phase. The eccentricities of lower mass CO white dwarfs may be explained by alternative formation channels.</description>

      <title>Genuine Retrieval of the AGN Host Stellar Population (GRAHSP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19297</link>

Abstract: The assembly and co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their host galaxy stellar population is a key open questions in galaxy evolution. Stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), are inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED). For galaxies triggering SMBH activity, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contaminates the light at all wavelengths, hampering the inference of galaxy parameters. Incomplete AGN templates can lead to systematic overestimates of the stellar mass, biasing our understanding of AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This challenge has gained further impetus with the advent of sensitive wide-area surveys with millions of luminous AGN, including by eROSITA, Euclid and LSST. We aim to estimate the accuracy and bias of AGN host galaxy parameters and improve upon existing techniques. This work makes two contributions: 1) a new SED fitting code, GRAHSP, with a flexible, empirically motivated AGN model including a power law continuum emission lines, a FeII forest and a flexible infrared torus. We verify that our model reproduces published X-ray to infrared SEDs of AGN to better than 20\% accuracy. A fully Bayesian fit with nested sampling includes uncertainties in the model and the data, making the inference highly robust. 2) we created a benchmark photometric dataset where pure quasars are merged with non-AGN pure galaxies into a hybrid (Chimera) object but with known galaxy and AGN properties. Comparing the true and retrieved $M_\star$, SFR and AGN luminosities shows that previous codes systematically over-estimate $M_\star$ and SFR by 0.5 dex with a wide scatter of 0.7 dex, at AGN luminosities above 10^44 erg/s. In contrast, GRAHSP shows no bias on $M_\star$ and SFR. GRAHSP also estimates more realistic uncertainties. GRAHSP enables characterization of the environmental conditions conducive to black hole growth. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Implications of Fermionic Dark Matter Interactions on Anisotropic Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of Dark matter (DM) within a neutron star (NS) can substantially influence the macroscopic properties. It is commonly assumed that the pressure inside an NS is isotropic, but in reality, pressure is locally anisotropic. This study explores the properties of anisotropic NS with a subfraction of DM (isotropic) trapped inside. Implementing a two-fluid formalism with three Equations of State (EOS): AP3 (a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction model), BSk22 (modeling atomic nuclei and neutron-matter), and MPA1 (considering relativistic effects in nuclear interactions). The properties of NS, such as mass ($M$), radius ($R$), and dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), for various DM-anisotropic configurations, have been rigorously tested against observational constraints. These constraints include data from the binary NS merger GW170817, NICER x-ray measurements, and pulsar mass-radius observations. We observe that with increasing DM subfraction, higher anisotropies could also satisfy the observational constraints. Furthermore, increasing the coupling ($g$) between DM and its mediator leads to the formation of a core-halo structure, with a DM halo surrounding the baryonic matter (BM). Specifically, for coupling values of $g = 10^{-4}$, $10^{-3.7}$, and $10^{-3.5}$, we observe that the maximum radius ($R_{max}$) decreases with increasing anisotropy, which contrasts with the behavior at $g = 10^{-5}$ and in scenarios with no DM. Our analysis indicates that binary pulsar systems could potentially constrain the extent of admixed anisotropic NS or, more optimistically, provide evidence for the existence of DM-admixed anisotropic NS.</description>
