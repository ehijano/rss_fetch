      <title>Coupled dynamics of wall pressure and transpiration, with implications for the modeling of tailored surfaces and turbulent drag reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall-based active and passive flow control for drag reduction in low Reynolds number (Re) turbulent flows can lead to three typical phenomena: i) attenuation or ii) amplification of the near-wall cycle, and iii) generation of spanwise rollers. The present study conducts direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a low Re turbulent channel flow and demonstrates that each flow response can be generated with a wall transpiration at two sets of spatial scales, termed "streak" and "roller" scales. The effect of the transpiration is controlled by its relative phase to the background flow, which can be parametrized by the wall pressure. Streak scales i) attenuate the near-wall cycle if transpiration and wall-pressure are approximately in-phase or ii) amplify it otherwise, and iii) roller scales energize spanwise rollers when transpiration and wall pressure are out-of-phase. The dynamics of the wall pressure and transpiration are coupled and robust relative phase relations, which are required to trigger the flow responses, can result if the source term of the linear fast or nonlinear slow pressure correlates with the wall transpiration over a scale-dependent height or if the temporal frequency content of the wall transpiration is approximately sparse. The importance of each condition depends on the relative magnitude of the pressure components, which is significantly altered by the transpiration. The analogy in flow response suggests that transpiration with the two scale families and their phase relations to the wall pressure represent fundamental building blocks for flows over tailored surfaces including riblets, porous, and permeable walls.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant effects in pilot-wave hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pilot-wave hydrodynamics concerns the dynamics of 'walkers,' droplets walking on a vibrating bath, and has provided the basis for the burgeoning field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We here explore a theoretical model of pilot-wave hydrodynamics that relaxes the simplifying assumption of resonance between the droplet and its pilot wave, specifically the assumption of a fixed impact phase between the bouncing drop and its wave field. The model captures both the vertical and horizontal dynamics of the drop, allowing one to examine non-resonant effects for both free and constrained walkers. The model provides new rationale for a number of previously reported but poorly understood features of free walker motion in pilot-wave hydrodynamics, including colinear swaying at the onset of motion, intermittent walking, and chaotic speed oscillations, all of which are accompanied by sporadic changes in the impact phase of the bouncing drop. The model also highlights the degeneracy in the droplets' vertical dynamics, specifically, the possibility of two distinct bouncing phases and of switching between the two. Consideration of this degeneracy is critical to understanding the droplet dynamics and statistics emerging in confined geometries at high memory and the interaction of walking droplets with standing Faraday waves.</description>

      <title>Determination of the Young's angle using static friction in capillary bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently contact angle hysteresis in two-dimensional droplets lying on a solid surface has been studied extensively in terms of static friction due to pinning forces at contact points. Here we propose a method to determine the coefficient of static friction using two-dimensional horizontal capillary bridges. This method requires only the measurement of capillary force and separation of plates, dispensing with the need for direct measurement of critical contact angles which is notoriously difficult. Based on this determination of friction coefficient, it is possible to determine the Young's angle from its relation to critical contact angles (advancing or receding). The Young's angle determined with our method is different either from the value estimated by Adam and Jessop a hundred years ago or the value argued by Drelich recently, though it is much closer to Adam and Jessop's numerically. The relation between energy and capillary force shows a capillary bridge behaves like a spring. Solving the Young-Laplace's equation, we can also locate the precise positions of neck or bulge and identify the exact moment when a pinch-off occurs.</description>

      <title>Morphodynamics of surface-attached active drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological and synthetic systems are suspensions of oriented, actively-moving components. Unlike in passive suspensions, the interplay between orientational order, active flows, and interactions with boundaries gives rise to fascinating new phenomena in such active suspensions. Here, we examine the paradigmatic example of a surface-attached drop of an active suspension (an "active drop"), which has so far only been studied in the idealized limit of thin drops. We find that such surface-attached active drops can exhibit a wide array of stable steady-state shapes and internal flows that are far richer than those documented previously, depending on boundary conditions and the strength of active stresses. Our analysis uncovers quantitative principles to predict and even rationally control the conditions under which these different states arise -- yielding design principles for next-generation active materials.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoretic transport of colloids in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how colloids move in crowded environments is key for gaining control over their transport in applications such as drug delivery, filtration, contaminant/microplastic remediation and agriculture. The classical models of colloid transport in porous media rely on geometric characteristics of the medium, and hydrodynamic/non-hydrodynamic equilibrium interactions to predict their behavior. However, chemical gradients are ubiquitous in these environments and can lead to the non-equilibrium diffusiophoretic migration of colloids. Here, combining microfluidic experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling we demonstrate that diffusiophoresis leads to significant macroscopic changes in the dispersion of colloids in porous media. We displace a suspension of colloids dispersed in a background salt solution with a higher/lower salinity solution and monitor the removal of the colloids from the medium. While mixing weakens the solute gradients, leading to the diffusiophoretic velocities that are orders of magnitude weaker than the background fluid flow, we show that the cross-streamline migration of colloids changes their macroscopic transit time and dispersion through the medium by an order of magnitude compared to the control case with no salinity gradients. Our observations demonstrate that solute gradients modulate the influence of geometric disorder on the transport, pointing to the need for revisiting the classical models of colloid transport in porous media to obtain predictive models for technological, medical, and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Variational Quantum Algorithms for generalized linear and nonlinear transport phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) to solve linear and nonlinear thermofluid dynamic transport equations. The hybrid classical-quantum framework is applied to problems governed by the heat, wave, and Burgers' equation in combination with different engineering boundary conditions. Topics covered include the consideration of non-constant material properties and upwind-biased first- and higher-order approximations, widely used in engineering Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), by the use of a mask function. The framework is able to convert band matrices arising from Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) discretized on structured grids into quantum gates, thus contributing to the development of a modular library for quantum computing translations of CFD procedures. Verification examples demonstrate high predictive agreement with classical methods. Furthermore, the scalability analysis shows a $\textit{polylog}$ complexity in the number of qubits of the quantum circuits involved. Remaining challenges refer to the implicit construction of upwind schemes.</description>

      <title>A p-Multigrid Accelerated Nodal Spectral Element Method for Free-Surface Incompressible Navier-Stokes Model of Nonlinear Water Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral element model for general-purpose simulation of non-overturning nonlinear water waves using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) with a free surface. The numerical implementation of the spectral element method is inspired by the related work by Engsig-Karup et al. (2016) and is based on nodal Lagrange basis functions, mass matrix-based integration and gradient recovery using global $L^2$ projections. The resulting model leverages the high-order accurate -- possibly exponential -- error convergence and has support for geometric flexibility allowing for computationally efficient simulations of nonlinear wave propagation. An explicit fourth-order accurate Runge-Kutta scheme is employed for the temporal integration, and a mixed-stage numerical discretization is the basis for a pressure-velocity coupling that makes it possible to maintain high-order accuracy in both the temporal and spatial discretizations while preserving mass conservation. Furthermore, the numerical scheme is accelerated by solving the discrete Poisson problem using an iterative solver strategy based on a geometric $p$-multigrid method. This problem constitutes the main computational bottleneck in INSE models. It is shown through numerical experiments, that the model achieves spectral convergence in the velocity fields for highly nonlinear waves, and there is excellent agreement with experimental data for the simulation of the classical benchmark of harmonic wave generation over a submerged bar. The geometric $p$-multigrid solver demonstrates $O(n)$ computational scalability simulations, making it a suitable efficient solver strategy as a candidate for extensions to more complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

Abstract: A GPU-accelerated version of the lattice Boltzmann method for efficient simulation of soft materials is introduced. Unlike standard approaches, this method reconstructs the distribution functions from available hydrodynamic variables (density, momentum, and pressure tensor) without storing the full set of discrete populations. This scheme shows satisfactory numerical stability, significantly lower memory requirements, and data access cost. A series of benchmark tests of relevance to soft matter, such as collisions of fluid droplets, is discussed to validate the method. The results can be of particular interest for high-performance simulations of soft matter systems on future exascale computers.</description>

Abstract: Turbulence, ubiquitous in nature and across various systems, exhibits chaotic and intermittent fluctuations in space and time, defying precise prediction. For nearly a century, extensive efforts have been made to uncover the underlying universality and invariant laws from the immense disorder and chaotic nature of turbulence. While the celebrated Kolmogorov -5/3 law stands as a robust cornerstone, it falls short in capturing the diverse scaling behavior exhibited in turbulence influenced by external volume forces, like thermal convection and electrokinetic flows. This study proposes a general framework that couples the fluxes of kinetic energy and scalar variance, culminating in the formulation of a universal conservation law. This framework offers a comprehensive quad-cascade depiction of turbulence, enabling predictions that beyond the limitations of existing models. We illustrate this framework with microfluidic experiments on electrokinetic turbulence, wherein power spectra of concentration and velocity fluctuations exhibit the predicted scaling behaviors, providing remarkable agreement with theory. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the complete cascade process in turbulence driven by external volume forces but also hold promise for insights into other turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Measurements and modeling of induced flow in collective vertical migration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions among swimming or flying organisms can lead to complex flows on the scale of the group. These emergent fluid dynamics are often more complex than a linear superposition of individual organism flows, especially at intermediate Reynolds numbers. This paper presents an approach to estimate the flow induced by multiple swimmer wakes in proximity using a semi-analytical model that conserves mass and momentum in the aggregation. The key equations are derived analytically, while the implementation and solution of these equations are carried out numerically. This model was informed by and compared with empirical measurements of induced vertical migrations of brine shrimp, $\textit{Artemia salina}$. The response of individual swimmers to ambient background flow and light intensity was evaluated. In addition, the time-resolved three-dimensional spatial configuration of the swimmers was measured using a recently developed laser scanning system. Numerical results using the model found that the induced flow at the front of the aggregation was insensitive to the presence of downstream swimmers, with the induced flow tending towards asymptote beyond a threshold aggregation length. Closer swimmer spacing led to higher induced flow speeds, in some cases leading to model predictions of induced flow exceeding swimmer speeds required to maintain a stable spatial configuration. This result was reconciled by comparing two different models for the near-wake of each swimmer. The results demonstrate that aggregation-scale flows result from a complex, yet predictable interplay amongst organism-scale wake structure, swimmer spacing and configuration, and aggregation size.</description>

      <title>Pressure drop reduction due to coupling between shear-thinning fluid flow and a weakly deformable channel wall: A reciprocal theorem approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem to derive a closed-form expression for the pressure drop reduction due to the coupling between shear-thinning fluid flow and a weakly deformable channel wall in terms of the shear rate and the viscosity function (and its derivative) of the underlying rigid-channel flow. The methodology is applied in parallel to fluids for which the generalized Newtonian viscosity depends on either the shear rate or the shear stress magnitude. When the viscosity model allows for a closed-form solution for the axial velocity profile in a straight and rigid channel, the pressure drop reduction can be evaluated in closed form, which we demonstrate for the power-law and Ellis viscosity models as featured examples and to enable comparisons to previous works. Importantly, the pressure drop reduction under the Ellis model is valid for both small and large Carreau (or Ellis) numbers, and we show that it reduces to the analytical expression under the power-law model for large Carreau (small Ellis) numbers.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Integral Method for Void Fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel method, the Gaussian Integral Method (GIM), is presented for calculating void fractions in Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) simulations. GIM is versatile and applicable to various grid types, including structured and unstructured polyhedral meshes, without requiring special boundary treatments. An optimization technique is introduced to make GIM independent of grid resolution and type. The method is validated against experimental data from a fluidized bed, demonstrating that GIM produces realistic simulations closely resembling experimental observations. Additionally, unstructured polyhedral grids using GIM outperform structured grids of equivalent resolution, yielding results more aligned with experimental data. The gradient of the void fraction is computed in the CFD solver and utilized in the DEM solver for precise estimation at particle locations. Overall, GIM provides an effective solution for void fraction calculations in particulate media simulations with complex geometries, enhancing the accuracy and applicability of CFD-DEM simulations in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann simulations for soft flowing matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Lattice Boltzmann method has found major scope for the simulation of a large spectrum of problems in soft matter, from multiphase and multi-component microfluidic flows, to foams, emulsions, colloidal flows, to name but a few. Crucial to many such applications is the role of supramolecular interactions which occur whenever mesoscale structures, such as bubbles or droplets, come in close contact, say of the order of tens of nanometers. Regardless of their specific physico-chemical origin, such near-contact interactions are vital to preserve the coherence of the mesoscale structures against coalescence phenomena promoted by capillarity and surface tension, hence the need of including them in Lattice Boltzmann schemes. Strictly speaking, this entails a complex multiscale problem, covering about six spatial decades, from centimeters down to tens of nanometers, and almost twice as many in time. Such a multiscale problem can hardly be taken by a single computational method, hence the need for coarse-grained models for the near-contact interactions. In this review, we shall discuss such coarse-grained models and illustrate their application to a variety of soft flowing matter problems, such as soft flowing crystals, strongly confined dense emulsions, flowing hierarchical emulsions, soft granular flows, as well as the transmigration of active droplets across constrictions. Finally, we conclude with a few considerations on future developments in the direction of quantum-nanofluidics, machine learning, and quantum computing for soft flows applications.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann framework for multiphase flows by Eulerian-Eulerian Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is relatively straightforward, it demands a well-crafted framework to handle the complex partial differential equations involved in multiphase flow simulations. For the first time to our knowledge, this work proposes a novel LBM framework for solving Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow equations without any finite-difference correction. The proposed methodology and all reported LBM formulas can be already applied to any dimension. This opens a promising venue for simulating multiphase flows on large High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities and on novel parallel hardware. This LBM framework consists of six coupled LBM schemes - running on the same lattice - ensuring an efficient implementation in large codes with minimum effort. The preliminary numeral results agree in an excellent way with the a reference numerical solution obtained by a traditional finite difference solver.</description>

Abstract: We describe the duality of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics in three dimensions, leading to its reformulation in terms of a one-dimensional momentum loop equation. \textbf{The momentum loop equation does not have finite-time blow-up solutions.} The decaying turbulence is a solution of this equation equivalent to a string theory with discrete target space made of regular star polygons and Ising degrees of freedom on the sides. This string theory is solvable in the turbulent limit, equivalent to the quasiclassical approximation in a nontrivial calculable background. \textbf{As a result, the spectrum of decay indexes is analytically computed, and it agrees very well with real and numerical experiments. } Among the decay indexes, there are complex conjugate pairs related to zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The Kolmogorov scaling laws are replaced by certain number theory functions, which are nonlinear in the log-log scale.</description>
