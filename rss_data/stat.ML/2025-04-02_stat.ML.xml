      <title>Communication-Efficient l_0 Penalized Least Square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient penalized regression algorithm for high-dimensional sparse linear regression models with massive data. This approach incorporates an optimized distributed system communication algorithm, named CESDAR algorithm, based on the Enhanced Support Detection and Root finding algorithm. The CESDAR algorithm leverages data distributed across multiple machines to compute and update the active set and introduces the communication-efficient surrogate likelihood framework to approximate the optimal solution for the full sample on the active set, resulting in the avoidance of raw data transmission, which enhances privacy and data security, while significantly improving algorithm execution speed and substantially reducing communication costs. Notably, this approach achieves the same statistical accuracy as the global estimator. Furthermore, this paper explores an extended version of CESDAR and an adaptive version of CESDAR to enhance algorithmic speed and optimize parameter selection, respectively. Simulations and real data benchmarks experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the CESDAR algorithm.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Transfer Learning for Community Detection using Locally Distributed Multiple Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a new spectral clustering-based method called TransNet for transfer learning in community detection of network data. Our goal is to improve the clustering performance of the target network using auxiliary source networks, which are heterogeneous, privacy-preserved, and locally stored across various sources. The edges of each locally stored network are perturbed using the randomized response mechanism to achieve differential privacy. Notably, we allow the source networks to have distinct privacy-preserving and heterogeneity levels as often desired in practice. To better utilize the information from the source networks, we propose a novel adaptive weighting method to aggregate the eigenspaces of the source networks multiplied by adaptive weights chosen to incorporate the effects of privacy and heterogeneity. We propose a regularization method that combines the weighted average eigenspace of the source networks with the eigenspace of the target network to achieve an optimal balance between them. Theoretically, we show that the adaptive weighting method enjoys the error-bound-oracle property in the sense that the error bound of the estimated eigenspace only depends on informative source networks. We also demonstrate that TransNet performs better than the estimator using only the target network and the estimator using only the weighted source networks.</description>

      <title>A formula for the area of a triangle: Useless, but explicitly in Deep Sets form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any permutation-invariant function of data points $\vec{r}_i$ can be written in the form $\rho(\sum_i\phi(\vec{r}_i))$ for suitable functions $\rho$ and $\phi$. This form - known in the machine-learning literature as Deep Sets - also generates a map-reduce algorithm. The area of a triangle is a permutation-invariant function of the locations $\vec{r}_i$ of the three corners $1\leq i\leq 3$. We find the polynomial formula for the area of a triangle that is explicitly in Deep Sets form. This project was motivated by questions about the fundamental computational complexity of $n$-point statistics in cosmology; that said, no insights of any kind were gained from these results.</description>

Abstract: The economic feasibility of nuclear microreactors will depend on minimizing operating costs through advancements in autonomous control, especially when these microreactors are operating alongside other types of energy systems (e.g., renewable energy). This study explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for real-time drum control in microreactors, exploring performance in regard to load-following scenarios. By leveraging a point kinetics model with thermal and xenon feedback, we first establish a baseline using a single-output RL agent, then compare it against a traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. This study demonstrates that RL controllers, including both single- and multi-agent RL (MARL) frameworks, can achieve similar or even superior load-following performance as traditional PID control across a range of load-following scenarios. In short transients, the RL agent was able to reduce the tracking error rate in comparison to PID. Over extended 300-minute load-following scenarios in which xenon feedback becomes a dominant factor, PID maintained better accuracy, but RL still remained within a 1% error margin despite being trained only on short-duration scenarios. This highlights RL's strong ability to generalize and extrapolate to longer, more complex transients, affording substantial reductions in training costs and reduced overfitting. Furthermore, when control was extended to multiple drums, MARL enabled independent drum control as well as maintained reactor symmetry constraints without sacrificing performance -- an objective that standard single-agent RL could not learn. We also found that, as increasing levels of Gaussian noise were added to the power measurements, the RL controllers were able to maintain lower error rates than PID, and to do so with less control effort.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Detection through Replicated Execution of Outsourced Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common practice to outsource the training of machine learning models to cloud providers. Clients who do so gain from the cloud's economies of scale, but implicitly assume trust: the server should not deviate from the client's training procedure. A malicious server may, for instance, seek to insert backdoors in the model. Detecting a backdoored model without prior knowledge of both the backdoor attack and its accompanying trigger remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we show that a client with access to multiple cloud providers can replicate a subset of training steps across multiple servers to detect deviation from the training procedure in a similar manner to differential testing. Assuming some cloud-provided servers are benign, we identify malicious servers by the substantial difference between model updates required for backdooring and those resulting from clean training. Perhaps the strongest advantage of our approach is its suitability to clients that have limited-to-no local compute capability to perform training; we leverage the existence of multiple cloud providers to identify malicious updates without expensive human labeling or heavy computation. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach on an outsourced supervised learning task where $50\%$ of the cloud providers insert their own backdoor; our approach is able to correctly identify $99.6\%$ of them. In essence, our approach is successful because it replaces the signature-based paradigm taken by existing approaches with an anomaly-based detection paradigm. Furthermore, our approach is robust to several attacks from adaptive adversaries utilizing knowledge of our detection scheme.</description>

      <title>Are Domain Generalization Benchmarks with Accuracy on the Line Misspecified?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spurious correlations are unstable statistical associations that hinder robust decision-making. Conventional wisdom suggests that models relying on such correlations will fail to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD), especially under strong distribution shifts. However, empirical evidence challenges this view as naive in-distribution empirical risk minimizers often achieve the best OOD accuracy across popular OOD generalization benchmarks. In light of these results, we propose a different perspective: many widely used benchmarks for evaluating robustness to spurious correlations are misspecified. Specifically, they fail to include shifts in spurious correlations that meaningfully impact OOD generalization, making them unsuitable for evaluating the benefit of removing such correlations. We establish conditions under which a distribution shift can reliably assess a model's reliance on spurious correlations. Crucially, under these conditions, we should not observe a strong positive correlation between in-distribution and OOD accuracy, often called "accuracy on the line." Yet, most state-of-the-art benchmarks exhibit this pattern, suggesting they do not effectively assess robustness. Our findings expose a key limitation in current benchmarks used to evaluate domain generalization algorithms, that is, models designed to avoid spurious correlations. We highlight the need to rethink how robustness to spurious correlations is assessed, identify well-specified benchmarks the field should prioritize, and enumerate strategies for designing future benchmarks that meaningfully reflect robustness under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>DiffDenoise: Self-Supervised Medical Image Denoising with Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many self-supervised denoising approaches have been proposed in recent years. However, these methods tend to overly smooth images, resulting in the loss of fine structures that are essential for medical applications. In this paper, we propose DiffDenoise, a powerful self-supervised denoising approach tailored for medical images, designed to preserve high-frequency details. Our approach comprises three stages. First, we train a diffusion model on noisy images, using the outputs of a pretrained Blind-Spot Network as conditioning inputs. Next, we introduce a novel stabilized reverse sampling technique, which generates clean images by averaging diffusion sampling outputs initialized with a pair of symmetric noises. Finally, we train a supervised denoising network using noisy images paired with the denoised outputs generated by the diffusion model. Our results demonstrate that DiffDenoise outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world medical image denoising tasks. We provide both a theoretical foundation and practical insights, demonstrating the method's effectiveness across various medical imaging modalities and anatomical structures.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation Under MNAR Missingness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current domain adaptation methods under missingness shift are restricted to Missing At Random (MAR) missingness mechanisms. However, in many real-world examples, the MAR assumption may be too restrictive. When covariates are Missing Not At Random (MNAR) in both source and target data, the common covariate shift solutions, including importance weighting, are not directly applicable. We show that under reasonable assumptions, the problem of MNAR missingness shift can be reduced to an imputation problem. This allows us to leverage recent methodological developments in both the traditional statistics and machine/deep-learning literature for MNAR imputation to develop a novel domain adaptation procedure for MNAR missingness shift. We further show that our proposed procedure can be extended to handle simultaneous MNAR missingness and covariate shifts. We apply our procedure to Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from two hospitals in south and northeast regions of the US. In this setting we expect different hospital networks and regions to serve different populations and to have different procedures, practices, and software for inputting and recording data, causing simultaneous missingness and covariate shifts.</description>

      <title>Data Cleansing for GANs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) expands, it becomes increasingly critical to develop a unified approach that improves performance across various generative tasks. One effective strategy that applies to any machine learning task is identifying harmful instances, whose removal improves the performance. While previous studies have successfully estimated these harmful training instances in supervised settings, their approaches are not easily applicable to GANs. The challenge lies in two requirements of the previous approaches that do not apply to GANs. First, previous approaches require that the absence of a training instance directly affects the parameters. However, in the training for GANs, the instances do not directly affect the generator's parameters since they are only fed into the discriminator. Second, previous approaches assume that the change in loss directly quantifies the harmfulness of the instance to a model's performance, while common types of GAN losses do not always reflect the generative performance. To overcome the first challenge, we propose influence estimation methods that use the Jacobian of the generator's gradient with respect to the discriminator's parameters (and vice versa). Such a Jacobian represents the indirect effect between two models: how removing an instance from the discriminator's training changes the generator's parameters. Second, we propose an instance evaluation scheme that measures the harmfulness of each training instance based on how a GAN evaluation metric (e.g., Inception score) is expected to change by the instance's removal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that removing the identified harmful instances significantly improves the generative performance on various GAN evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>TAMIS: Tailored Membership Inference Attacks on Synthetic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) enable to empirically assess the privacy of a machine learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose TAMIS, a novel MIA against differentially-private synthetic data generation methods that rely on graphical models. This attack builds upon MAMA-MIA, a recently-published state-of-the-art method. It lowers its computational cost and requires less attacker knowledge. Our attack is the product of a two-fold improvement. First, we recover the graphical model having generated a synthetic dataset by using solely that dataset, rather than shadow-modeling over an auxiliary one. This proves less costly and more performant. Second, we introduce a more mathematically-grounded attack score, that provides a natural threshold for binary predictions. In our experiments, TAMIS achieves better or similar performance as MAMA-MIA on replicas of the SNAKE challenge.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models: Complexity, Dimensionality, and Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative networks have shown remarkable success in learning complex data distributions, particularly in generating high-dimensional data from lower-dimensional inputs. While this capability is well-documented empirically, its theoretical underpinning remains unclear. One common theoretical explanation appeals to the widely accepted manifold hypothesis, which suggests that many real-world datasets, such as images and signals, often possess intrinsic low-dimensional geometric structures. Under this manifold hypothesis, it is widely believed that to approximate a distribution on a $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the latent dimension needs to be at least $d$ or $d+1$. In this work, we show that this requirement on the latent dimension is not necessary by demonstrating that generative networks can approximate distributions on $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds from inputs of any arbitrary dimension, even lower than $d$, taking inspiration from the concept of space-filling curves. This approach, in turn, leads to a super-exponential complexity bound of the deep neural networks through expanded neurons. Our findings thus challenge the conventional belief on the relationship between input dimensionality and the ability of generative networks to model data distributions. This novel insight not only corroborates the practical effectiveness of generative networks in handling complex data structures, but also underscores a critical trade-off between approximation error, dimensionality, and model complexity.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric spectral density estimation using interactive mechanisms under local differential privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of nonparametric estimation of the spectral density for a centered stationary Gaussian time series under local differential privacy constraints. Specifically, we propose new interactive privacy mechanisms for three tasks: estimating a single covariance coefficient, estimating the spectral density at a fixed frequency, and estimating the entire spectral density function. Our approach achieves faster rates through a two-stage process: we apply first the Laplace mechanism to the truncated value and then use the former privatized sample to gain knowledge on the dependence mechanism in the time series. For spectral densities belonging to H\"older and Sobolev smoothness classes, we demonstrate that our estimators improve upon the non-interactive mechanism of Kroll (2024) for small privacy parameter $\alpha$, since the pointwise rates depend on $n\alpha^2$ instead of $n\alpha^4$. Moreover, we show that the rate $(n\alpha^4)^{-1}$ is optimal for estimating a covariance coefficient with non-interactive mechanisms. However, the $L_2$ rate of our interactive estimator is slower than the pointwise rate. We show how to use these estimators to provide a bona-fide locally differentially private covariance matrix estimator.</description>

      <title>Causal Models for Growing Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks grow over time; statistical models based on node exchangeability are not appropriate. Instead of constraining the structure of the \textit{distribution} of edges, we propose that the relevant symmetries refer to the \textit{causal structure} between them. We first enumerate the 96 causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) models over pairs of nodes (dyad variables) in a growing network with finite ancestral sets that are invariant to node deletion. We then partition them into 21 classes with ancestral sets that are closed under node marginalization. Several of these classes are remarkably amenable to distributed and asynchronous evaluation. As an example, we highlight a simple model that exhibits flexible power-law degree distributions and emergent phase transitions in sparsity, which we characterize analytically. With few parameters and much conditional independence, our proposed framework provides natural baseline models for causal inference in relational data.</description>

      <title>Safe Policy Learning through Extrapolation: Application to Pre-trial Risk Assessment</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic recommendations and decisions have become ubiquitous in today's society. Many of these data-driven policies, especially in the realm of public policy, are based on known, deterministic rules to ensure their transparency and interpretability. We examine a particular case of algorithmic pre-trial risk assessments in the US criminal justice system, which provide deterministic classification scores and recommendations to help judges make release decisions. Our goal is to analyze data from a unique field experiment on an algorithmic pre-trial risk assessment to investigate whether the scores and recommendations can be improved. Unfortunately, prior methods for policy learning are not applicable because they require existing policies to be stochastic. We develop a maximin robust optimization approach that partially identifies the expected utility of a policy, and then finds a policy that maximizes the worst-case expected utility. The resulting policy has a statistical safety property, limiting the probability of producing a worse policy than the existing one, under structural assumptions about the outcomes. Our analysis of data from the field experiment shows that we can safely improve certain components of the risk assessment instrument by classifying arrestees as lower risk under a wide range of utility specifications, though the analysis is not informative about several components of the instrument.</description>

      <title>Causal Dynamic Variational Autoencoder for Counterfactual Regression in Longitudinal Data</title>

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects over time is relevant in many real-world applications, such as precision medicine, epidemiology, economy, and marketing. Many state-of-the-art methods either assume the observations of all confounders or seek to infer the unobserved ones. We take a different perspective by assuming unobserved risk factors, i.e., adjustment variables that affect only the sequence of outcomes. Under unconfoundedness, we target the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) estimation with unobserved heterogeneity in the treatment response due to missing risk factors. We address the challenges posed by time-varying effects and unobserved adjustment variables. Led by theoretical results over the validity of the learned adjustment variables and generalization bounds over the treatment effect, we devise Causal DVAE (CDVAE). This model combines a Dynamic Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) framework with a weighting strategy using propensity scores to estimate counterfactual responses. The CDVAE model allows for accurate estimation of ITE and captures the underlying heterogeneity in longitudinal data. Evaluations of our model show superior performance over state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Optimal generalisation and learning transition in extensive-width shallow neural networks near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a teacher-student model of supervised learning with a fully-trained two-layer neural network whose width $k$ and input dimension $d$ are large and proportional. We provide an effective theory for approximating the Bayes-optimal generalisation error of the network for any activation function in the regime of sample size $n$ scaling quadratically with the input dimension, i.e., around the interpolation threshold where the number of trainable parameters $kd+k$ and of data $n$ are comparable. Our analysis tackles generic weight distributions. We uncover a discontinuous phase transition separating a "universal" phase from a "specialisation" phase. In the first, the generalisation error is independent of the weight distribution and decays slowly with the sampling rate $n/d^2$, with the student learning only some non-linear combinations of the teacher weights. In the latter, the error is weight distribution-dependent and decays faster due to the alignment of the student towards the teacher network. We thus unveil the existence of a highly predictive solution near interpolation, which is however potentially hard to find by practical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Thinning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal in thinning is to summarize a dataset using a small set of representative points. Remarkably, sub-Gaussian thinning algorithms like Kernel Halving and Compress can match the quality of uniform subsampling while substantially reducing the number of summary points. However, existing guarantees cover only a restricted range of distributions and kernel-based quality measures and suffer from pessimistic dimension dependence. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, we design practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.</description>

      <title>Addressing pitfalls in implicit unobserved confounding synthesis using explicit block hierarchical ancestral sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unbiased data synthesis is crucial for evaluating causal discovery algorithms in the presence of unobserved confounding, given the scarcity of real-world datasets. A common approach, implicit parameterization, encodes unobserved confounding by modifying the off-diagonal entries of the idiosyncratic covariance matrix while preserving positive definiteness. Within this approach, we identify that state-of-the-art protocols have two distinct issues that hinder unbiased sampling from the complete space of causal models: first, we give a detailed analysis of use of diagonally dominant constructions restricts the spectrum of partial correlation matrices; and second, the restriction of possible graphical structures when sampling bidirected edges, unnecessarily ruling out valid causal models. To address these limitations, we propose an improved explicit modeling approach for unobserved confounding, leveraging block-hierarchical ancestral generation of ground truth causal graphs. Algorithms for converting the ground truth DAG into ancestral graph is provided so that the output of causal discovery algorithms could be compared with. We draw connections between implicit and explicit parameterization, prove that our approach fully covers the space of causal models, including those generated by the implicit parameterization, thus enabling more robust evaluation of methods for causal discovery and inference.</description>

      <title>Calibration Strategies for Robust Causal Estimation: Theoretical and Empirical Insights on Propensity Score Based Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The partitioning of data for estimation and calibration critically impacts the performance of propensity score based estimators like inverse probability weighting (IPW) and double/debiased machine learning (DML) frameworks. We extend recent advances in calibration techniques for propensity score estimation, improving the robustness of propensity scores in challenging settings such as limited overlap, small sample sizes, or unbalanced data. Our contributions are twofold: First, we provide a theoretical analysis of the properties of calibrated estimators in the context of DML. To this end, we refine existing calibration frameworks for propensity score models, with a particular emphasis on the role of sample-splitting schemes in ensuring valid causal inference. Second, through extensive simulations, we show that calibration reduces variance of inverse-based propensity score estimators while also mitigating bias in IPW, even in small-sample regimes. Notably, calibration improves stability for flexible learners (e.g., gradient boosting) while preserving the doubly robust properties of DML. A key insight is that, even when methods perform well without calibration, incorporating a calibration step does not degrade performance, provided that an appropriate sample-splitting approach is chosen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic coordinate descent algorithms are efficient methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most coordinates at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining coordinates. However, this approach is usually restricted to canonical basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we develop a new class of stochastic gradient descent algorithms with random search directions which uses the directional derivative of the gradient estimate following more general random vectors. We establish the almost sure convergence of these algorithms with decreasing step. We further investigate their central limit theorem and pay particular attention to analyze the impact of the search distributions on the asymptotic covariance matrix. We also provide non-asymptotic $\mathbb{L}^p$ rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Sharp Rates in Dependent Learning Theory: Avoiding Sample Size Deflation for the Square Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study statistical learning with dependent ($\beta$-mixing) data and square loss in a hypothesis class $\mathscr{F}\subset L_{\Psi_p}$ where $\Psi_p$ is the norm $\|f\|_{\Psi_p} \triangleq \sup_{m\geq 1} m^{-1/p} \|f\|_{L^m} $ for some $p\in [2,\infty]$. Our inquiry is motivated by the search for a sharp noise interaction term, or variance proxy, in learning with dependent data. Absent any realizability assumption, typical non-asymptotic results exhibit variance proxies that are deflated multiplicatively by the mixing time of the underlying covariates process. We show that whenever the topologies of $L^2$ and $\Psi_p$ are comparable on our hypothesis class $\mathscr{F}$ -- that is, $\mathscr{F}$ is a weakly sub-Gaussian class: $\|f\|_{\Psi_p} \lesssim \|f\|_{L^2}^\eta$ for some $\eta\in (0,1]$ -- the empirical risk minimizer achieves a rate that only depends on the complexity of the class and second order statistics in its leading term. Our result holds whether the problem is realizable or not and we refer to this as a \emph{near mixing-free rate}, since direct dependence on mixing is relegated to an additive higher order term. We arrive at our result by combining the above notion of a weakly sub-Gaussian class with mixed tail generic chaining. This combination allows us to compute sharp, instance-optimal rates for a wide range of problems. Examples that satisfy our framework include sub-Gaussian linear regression, more general smoothly parameterized function classes, finite hypothesis classes, and bounded smoothness classes.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for data-driven weather models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven weather forecasting models have experienced rapid progress over the last years. Recent studies, with models trained on reanalysis data, achieve impressive results and demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art physics-based numerical weather prediction models across a range of variables and evaluation metrics. Beyond improved predictions, the main advantages of data-driven weather models are their substantially lower computational costs and the faster generation of forecasts, once a model has been trained. However, most efforts in data-driven weather forecasting have been limited to deterministic, point-valued predictions, making it impossible to quantify forecast uncertainties, which is crucial in research and for optimal decision making in applications. Our overarching aim is to systematically study and compare uncertainty quantification methods to generate probabilistic weather forecasts from a state-of-the-art deterministic data-driven weather model, Pangu-Weather. Specifically, we compare approaches for quantifying forecast uncertainty based on generating ensemble forecasts via perturbations to the initial conditions, with the use of statistical and machine learning methods for post-hoc uncertainty quantification. In a case study on medium-range forecasts of selected weather variables over Europe, the probabilistic forecasts obtained by using the Pangu-Weather model in concert with uncertainty quantification methods show promising results and provide improvements over ensemble forecasts from the physics-based ensemble weather model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for lead times of up to 5 days.</description>

      <title>Assessing and improving reliability of neighbor embedding methods: a map-continuity perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualizing high-dimensional data is essential for understanding biomedical data and deep learning models. Neighbor embedding methods, such as t-SNE and UMAP, are widely used but can introduce misleading visual artifacts. We find that the manifold learning interpretations from many prior works are inaccurate and that the misuse stems from a lack of data-independent notions of embedding maps, which project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space. Leveraging the leave-one-out principle, we introduce LOO-map, a framework that extends embedding maps beyond discrete points to the entire input space. We identify two forms of map discontinuity that distort visualizations: one exaggerates cluster separation and the other creates spurious local structures. As a remedy, we develop two types of point-wise diagnostic scores to detect unreliable embedding points and improve hyperparameter selection, which are validated on datasets from computer vision and single-cell omics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Posterior Samples for Bayesian Optimization via Rootfinding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions. This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves posterior sample paths, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with two sets of judiciously selected starting points, designed to combine exploration and exploitation. The number of starting points can be kept small without sacrificing optimization quality. Remarkably, even with just one point from each set, the global optimum is discovered most of the time. The algorithm scales practically linearly to high dimensions, breaking the curse of dimensionality. For Gaussian process Thompson sampling (GP-TS), we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner- and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI and GP-UCB in most cases. Our approach also improves the performance of other posterior sample-based acquisition functions, such as variants of entropy search. Furthermore, we propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the cost of one posterior sample. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/UQUH/TSRoots .</description>

      <title>Identifying Predictions That Influence the Future: Detecting Performative Concept Drift in Data Streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Drift has been extensively studied within the context of Stream Learning. However, it is often assumed that the deployed model's predictions play no role in the concept drift the system experiences. Closer inspection reveals that this is not always the case. Automated trading might be prone to self-fulfilling feedback loops. Likewise, malicious entities might adapt to evade detectors in the adversarial setting resulting in a self-negating feedback loop that requires the deployed models to constantly retrain. Such settings where a model may induce concept drift are called performative. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon. Our contributions are as follows: First, we define performative drift within a stream learning setting and distinguish it from other causes of drift. We introduce a novel type of drift detection task, aimed at identifying potential performative concept drift in data streams. We propose a first such performative drift detection approach, called CheckerBoard Performative Drift Detection (CB-PDD). We apply CB-PDD to both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets that exhibit varying degrees of self-fulfilling feedback loops. Results are positive with CB-PDD showing high efficacy, low false detection rates, resilience to intrinsic drift, comparability to other drift detection techniques, and an ability to effectively detect performative drift in semi-synthetic datasets. Secondly, we highlight the role intrinsic (traditional) drift plays in obfuscating performative drift and discuss the implications of these findings as well as the limitations of CB-PDD.</description>

Abstract: Overparameterized models trained with (stochastic) gradient descent are ubiquitous in modern machine learning. These large models achieve unprecedented performance on test data, but their theoretical understanding is still limited. In this paper, we take a step towards filling this gap by adopting an optimization perspective. More precisely, we study the implicit regularization properties of the gradient flow "algorithm" for estimating the parameters of a deep diagonal neural network. Our main contribution is showing that this gradient flow induces a mirror flow dynamic on the model, meaning that it is biased towards a specific solution of the problem depending on the initialization of the network. Along the way, we prove several properties of the trajectory.</description>

      <title>Balls-and-Bins Sampling for DP-SGD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Balls-and-Bins sampling for differentially private (DP) optimization methods such as DP-SGD. While it has been common practice to use some form of shuffling in DP-SGD implementations, privacy accounting algorithms have typically assumed that Poisson subsampling is used instead. Recent work by Chua et al. (ICML 2024), however, pointed out that shuffling based DP-SGD can have a much larger privacy cost in practical regimes of parameters. In this work we show that the Balls-and-Bins sampling achieves the "best-of-both" samplers, namely, the implementation of Balls-and-Bins sampling is similar to that of Shuffling and models trained using DP-SGD with Balls-and-Bins sampling achieve utility comparable to those trained using DP-SGD with Shuffling at the same noise multiplier, and yet, Balls-and-Bins sampling enjoys similar-or-better privacy amplification as compared to Poisson subsampling in practical regimes.</description>

      <title>Class-Dependent Perturbation Effects in Evaluating Time Series Attributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in time series applications, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are essential for understanding their predictions. Within XAI, feature attribution methods aim to identify which input features contribute the most to a model's prediction, with their evaluation typically relying on perturbation-based metrics. Through systematic empirical analysis across multiple datasets, model architectures, and perturbation strategies, we reveal previously overlooked class-dependent effects in these metrics: they show varying effectiveness across classes, achieving strong results for some while remaining less sensitive to others. In particular, we find that the most effective perturbation strategies often demonstrate the most pronounced class differences. Our analysis suggests that these effects arise from the learned biases of classifiers, indicating that perturbation-based evaluation may reflect specific model behaviors rather than intrinsic attribution quality. We propose an evaluation framework with a class-aware penalty term to help assess and account for these effects in evaluating feature attributions, offering particular value for class-imbalanced datasets. Although our analysis focuses on time series classification, these class-dependent effects likely extend to other structured data domains where perturbation-based evaluation is common.</description>

Abstract: The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has heralded an inflection point that changed how society thinks about knowledge acquisition. While GAI cannot be fully trusted for decision-making, it may still provide valuable information that can be integrated into a decision pipeline. Rather than seeing the lack of certitude and inherent randomness of GAI as a problem, we view it as an opportunity. Indeed, variable answers to given prompts can be leveraged to construct a prior distribution which reflects assuredness of AI predictions. This prior distribution may be combined with tailored datasets for a fully Bayesian analysis with an AI-driven prior. In this paper, we explore such a possibility within a non-parametric Bayesian framework. The basic idea consists of assigning a Dirichlet process prior distribution on the data-generating distribution with AI generative model as its baseline. Hyper-parameters of the prior can be tuned out-of-sample to assess the informativeness of the AI prior. Posterior simulation is achieved by computing a suitably randomized functional on an augmented data that consists of observed (labeled) data as well as fake data whose labels have been imputed using AI. This strategy can be parallelized and rapidly produces iid samples from the posterior by optimization as opposed to sampling from conditionals. Our method enables (predictive) inference and uncertainty quantification leveraging AI predictions in a coherent probabilistic manner.</description>
