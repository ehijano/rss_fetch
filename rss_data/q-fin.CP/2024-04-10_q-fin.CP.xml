      <title>Hedonic Models Incorporating ESG Factors for Time Series of Average Annual Home Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from 2000 through 2022, we analyze the predictive capability of the annual numbers of new home constructions and four available environmental, social, and governance factors on the average annual price of homes sold in eight major U.S. cities. We contrast the predictive capability of a P-spline generalized additive model (GAM) against a strictly linear version of the commonly used generalized linear model (GLM). As the data for the annual price and predictor variables constitute non-stationary time series, to avoid spurious correlations in the analysis we transform each time series appropriately to produce stationary series for use in the GAM and GLM models. While arithmetic returns or first differences are adequate transformations for the predictor variables, for the average price response variable we utilize the series of innovations obtained from AR(q)-ARCH(1) fits. Based on the GAM results, we find that the influence of ESG factors varies markedly by city, reflecting geographic diversity. Notably, the presence of air conditioning emerges as a strong factor. Despite limitations on the length of available time series, this study represents a pivotal step toward integrating ESG considerations into predictive real estate models.</description>

      <title>StockGPT: A GenAI Model for Stock Prediction and Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces StockGPT, an autoregressive ``number'' model trained and tested on 70 million daily U.S. stock returns over nearly 100 years. Treating each return series as a sequence of tokens, StockGPT automatically learns the hidden patterns predictive of future returns via its attention mechanism. On a held-out test sample from 2001 to 2023, a daily rebalanced long-short portfolio formed from StockGPT predictions earns an annual return of 119% with a Sharpe ratio of 6.5. The StockGPT-based portfolio completely spans momentum and long-/short-term reversals, eliminating the need for manually crafted price-based strategies, and also encompasses most leading stock market factors. This highlights the immense promise of generative AI in surpassing human in making complex financial investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Consistent asset modelling with random coefficients and switches between regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a stochastic model that enables capturing external influences in two specific ways. The model allows for the expression of uncertainty in the parametrisation of the stochastic dynamics and incorporates patterns to account for different behaviours across various times or regimes. To establish our framework, we initially construct a model with random parameters, where the switching between regimes can be dictated either by random variables or deterministically. Such a model is highly interpretable. We further ensure mathematical consistency by demonstrating that the framework can be elegantly expressed through local volatility models taking the form of standard jump diffusions. Additionally, we consider a Markov-modulated approach for the switching between regimes characterised by random parameters. For all considered models, we derive characteristic functions, providing a versatile tool with wide-ranging applications. In a numerical experiment, we apply the framework to the financial problem of option pricing. The impact of parameter uncertainty is analysed in a two-regime model, where the asset process switches between periods of high and low volatility imbued with high and low uncertainty, respectively.</description>
