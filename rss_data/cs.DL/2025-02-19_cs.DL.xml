      <title>A Visual Approach for Health Information Exploration: Adaptive Levels of Visual Granularity and Interaction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective and targeted provision of health information to consumers, specifically tailored to their needs and preferences, is indispensable in healthcare. With access to appropriate health information and adequate understanding, consumers are more likely to make informed and healthy decisions, become more proficient in recognizing symptoms, and potentially experience improvements in the prevention or treatment of their medical conditions. Most of today's health information, however, is provided in the form of static documents. In this paper, we present a novel and innovative visual health information system based on adaptive document visualizations. Depending on the user's information needs and preferences, the system can display its content with document visualization techniques at different levels of detail, aggregation, and visual granularity. Users can navigate using content organization along sections or automatically computed topics, and choose abstractions from full texts to word clouds. Our first contribution is a formative user study which demonstrated that the implemented document visualizations offer several advantages over traditional forms of document exploration. Informed from that, we identified a number of crucial aspects for further system development. Our second contribution is the introduction of an interaction provenance visualization which allows users to inspect which content, in which representation, and in which order has been received. We show how this allows to analyze different document exploration and navigation patterns, useful for automatic adaptation and recommendation functions. We also define a baseline taxonomy for adapting the document presentations which can, in principle, be leveraged by the observed user patterns. The interaction provenance view, furthermore, allows users to reflect on their exploration and inform future usage of the system.</description>

      <title>Network visualisations related to special functions based on the Scopus data since 1940</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Special functions are essential in theoretical and applied mathematics and have various applications in the applied sciences. Mathematicians have studied them for centuries, but there is still no bibliometric analysis that summarises the datasets of publications showing different network visualisations, such as co-author and keyword visualisations, basic keyword statistics and other data analyses. This work appears to be the first attempt to fill this gap by presenting different network visualisations based on 4025 documents with the keyword "special function" in their title, abstract or keywords belonging to the field of mathematics in the Scopus database. We also show that special functions are rarely used in geometric modelling, a mathematical foundation for CAD, industrial design, architecture, and other applied fields, and we discuss how different visualisations for special functions can be generated in the Julia programming language. The generated image and video visualisations can be helpful to academics to see the impact of different authors, to define their new research topics, to see connections or lack thereof between various topics, to find the most popular special functions, or for teaching purposes to show the importance of special functions and links to other topics in modern pure and applied mathematics and other sciences.</description>

      <title>Bridging AI and Science: Implications from a Large-Scale Literature Analysis of AI4Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has proven to be a transformative tool for advancing scientific research across a wide range of disciplines. However, a significant gap still exists between AI and scientific communities, limiting the full potential of AI methods in driving broad scientific discovery. Existing efforts in identifying and bridging this gap have often relied on qualitative examination of small samples of literature, offering a limited perspective on the broader AI4Science landscape. In this work, we present a large-scale analysis of the AI4Science literature, starting by using large language models to identify scientific problems and AI methods in publications from top science and AI venues. Leveraging this new dataset, we quantitatively highlight key disparities between AI methods and scientific problems, revealing substantial opportunities for deeper AI integration across scientific disciplines. Furthermore, we explore the potential and challenges of facilitating collaboration between AI and scientific communities through the lens of link prediction. Our findings and tools aim to promote more impactful interdisciplinary collaborations and accelerate scientific discovery through deeper and broader AI integration.
