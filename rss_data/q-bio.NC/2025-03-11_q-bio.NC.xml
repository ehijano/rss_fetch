      <title>I Think, Therefore I Hallucinate: Minds, Machines, and the Art of Being Wrong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This theoretical work examines 'hallucinations' in both human cognition and large language models, comparing how each system can produce perceptions or outputs that deviate from reality. Drawing on neuroscience and machine learning research, we highlight the predictive processes that underlie human and artificial thought. In humans, complex neural mechanisms interpret sensory information under uncertainty, sometimes filling in gaps and creating false perceptions. This inference occurs hierarchically: higher cortical levels send top-down predictions to lower-level regions, while mismatches (prediction errors) propagate upward to refine the model. LLMs, in contrast, rely on auto-regressive modeling of text and can generate erroneous statements in the absence of robust grounding. Despite these different foundations - biological versus computational - the similarities in their predictive architectures help explain why hallucinations occur. We propose that the propensity to generate incorrect or confabulated responses may be an inherent feature of advanced intelligence. In both humans and AI, adaptive predictive processes aim to make sense of incomplete information and anticipate future states, fostering creativity and flexibility, but also introducing the risk of errors. Our analysis illuminates how factors such as feedback, grounding, and error correction affect the likelihood of 'being wrong' in each system. We suggest that mitigating AI hallucinations (e.g., through improved training, post-processing, or knowledge-grounding methods) may also shed light on human cognitive processes, revealing how error-prone predictions can be harnessed for innovation without compromising reliability. By exploring these converging and divergent mechanisms, the paper underscores the broader implications for advancing both AI reliability and scientific understanding of human thought.</description>

      <title>The Role of Affective States in Computational Psychiatry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying psychiatric illness has often been limited by difficulties in connecting symptoms and behavior to neurobiology. Computational psychiatry approaches promise to bridge this gap by providing formal accounts of the latent information processing changes that underlie the development and maintenance of psychiatric phenomena. Models based on these theories generate individual-level parameter estimates which can then be tested for relationships to neurobiology. In this review, we explore computational modelling approaches to one key aspect of health and illness: affect. We discuss strengths and limitations of key approaches to modelling affect, with a focus on reinforcement learning, active inference, the hierarchical gaussian filter, and drift-diffusion models. We find that, in this literature, affect is an important source of modulation in decision making, and has a bidirectional influence on how individuals infer both internal and external states. Highlighting the potential role of affect in information processing changes underlying symptom development, we extend an existing model of psychosis, where affective changes are influenced by increasing cortical noise and consequent increases in either perceived environmental instability or expected noise in sensory input, becoming part of a self-reinforcing process generating negatively valenced, over-weighted priors underlying positive symptom development. We then provide testable predictions from this model at computational, neurobiological, and phenomenological levels of description.</description>

      <title>A 7T fMRI dataset of synthetic images for out-of-distribution modeling of vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting NeuroAI research by enabling computational models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the eight NSD subjects for 284 carefully controlled synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with NSD - specifically, self-supervised deep neural networks better explain neural responses than their task-supervised counterparts. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing, and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.</description>

      <title>On Questions of Predictability and Control of an Intelligent System Using Probabilistic State-Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central aims of neuroscience is to reliably predict the behavioral response of an organism using its neural activity. If possible, this implies we can causally manipulate the neural response and design brain-computer-interface systems to alter behavior, and vice-versa. Hence, predictions play an important role in both fundamental neuroscience and its applications. Can we predict the neural and behavioral states of an organism at any given time? Can we predict behavioral states using neural states, and vice-versa, and is there a memory-component required to reliably predict such states? Are the predictions computable within a given timescale to meaningfully stimulate and make the system reach the desired states? Through a series of mathematical treatments, such conjectures and questions are discussed. Answering them might be key for future developments in understanding intelligence and designing brain-computer-interfaces.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-response relations and response-response relations for membrane voltage and spike train of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons display spontaneous spiking (in the absence of stimulus signals) as well as a characteristic response to time-dependent external stimuli. In a simple but important class of stochastic neuron models, the integrate-and-fire model with Gaussian current noise, both aspects can mathematically be related via fluctuation-response relations (FRRs) as has been shown recently. Here we extend the class of FRRs to include the susceptibilities of the membrane voltage and subthreshold voltage nonlinearity as well as the power spectrum of the membrane voltage. For a simple but often considered IF model, the leaky IF model with white Gaussian noise, we exploit the FRRs and derive explicit expressions for the power spectrum and susceptibility of the subthreshold membrane voltage. We also put forward a relation between the response functions of the spike train and membrane voltage, a response-response relation (RRR) that holds true for a more general setting than considered in most parts of the paper. For the generalized IF model with an adaptation current and colored Gaussian noise we derive an FRR and an RRR. We briefly discuss useful applications of the derived FRRs and RRRs.</description>

      <title>System 0/1/2/3: Quad-process theory for multi-timescale embodied collective cognitive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.</description>

      <title>Resource-rational reinforcement learning and sensorimotor causal states, and resource-rational maximiners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new computational-level objective function for theoretical biology and theoretical neuroscience that combines: reinforcement learning, the study of learning with feedback via rewards; rate-distortion theory, a branch of information theory that deals with compressing signals to retain relevant information; and computational mechanics, the study of minimal sufficient statistics of prediction also known as causal states. We highlight why this proposal is likely only an approximation, but is likely to be an interesting one, and propose a new algorithm for evaluating it to obtain the newly-coined ``reward-rate manifold''. The performance of real and artificial agents in partially observable environments can be newly benchmarked using these reward-rate manifolds. Finally, we describe experiments that can probe whether or not biological organisms are resource-rational reinforcement learners, using as an example maximin strategies, as bacteria have been shown to be approximate maximiners -- doing their best in the worst-case environment, regardless of what is actually happening.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks detects regions disrupted by neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph theoretical methods have proven valuable for investigating alterations in both anatomical and functional brain connectivity networks during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that representing brain networks in a suitable geometric space can better capture their connectivity structure. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize brain connectivity changes using low dimensional, informative representations of networks in a latent geometric space. Specifically, the networks are embedded in a polar representation of the hyperbolic plane, the hyperbolic disk. Here, we use a geometric score, entirely based on the computation of distances between nodes in the latent space, to measure the effect of a perturbation on the nodes. Precisely, the score is a local measure of distortion in the geometric neighborhood of a node following a perturbation. The method is applied to a brain network dataset of patients with AD and healthy participants, derived from diffusion weighted (DWI) and functional (fMRI) magnetic resonance imaging scans. We show that, compared with standard graph measures, our method more accurately identifies the brain regions most affected by neurodegeneration. Notably, the abnormalities detected in memory related and frontal areas are robust across multiple brain parcellation scales. Finally, our findings suggest that the geometric perturbation score could serve as a potential biomarker for characterizing the progression of the disease.</description>

      <title>A Turing Test for Artificial Nets devoted to model Human Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this 2022 work we argued that, despite claims about successful modeling of the visual brain using artificial nets, the problem is far from being solved (even for low-level vision). Examples of open issues include: where should we read from ANNs in order to reproduce human behavior?, this ad-hoc read-out is considered part of the brain model or not?, should we use artificial psychophysics or artificial physiology?, in the case of ANNs, artificial experiments should literally match the experiments done with humans?. There is a clear need of rigorous procedures for experimental tests for ANNs devoted to model the visual brain, and more generally, to understand ANNs devoted to generic vision tasks. Following our experience in using low-level facts from Quantitative Visual Neuroscience in computer vision, in this work we presented the idea of developing a low-level dataset compiling the basic spatio-temporal and chromatic facts that are known to happen in the retina-V1 pathway, and they are not currently available in existing databases such as BrainScore. In our results we checked the behavior of three recently proposed models with similar architecture: (1) A parametric model tuned via Maximum Differentiation [Malo &amp; Simoncelli SPIE 15, Martinez et al. PLOS 18, Martinez et al. Front. Neurosci. 19], (2) A non-parametric model called PerceptNet tuned to maximize the correlation with human opinion on subjective distortions [Hepburn et al. IEEE ICIP 19], and (3) A model with the same encoder as PerceptNet, but tuned for image segmentation (published as Hernandez-Camara et al. Patt.Recogn.Lett. 23). Results on 10 compelling psycho/physio visual facts show that the first model is the one with closer behavior to the humans in terms of receptive fields, but more interestingly, on the nonlinear behavior when facing complex spatio-chromatic patterns of a range of luminances and contrasts.</description>

      <title>NeuroTree: Hierarchical Functional Brain Pathway Decoding for Mental Health Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing functional brain networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for understanding psychiatric disorders and addictive behaviors. While existing fMRI-based graph convolutional networks (GCNs) show considerable promise for feature extraction, they often fall short in characterizing complex relationships between brain regions and demographic factors and accounting for interpretable variables linked to psychiatric conditions. We propose NeuroTree to overcome these limitations, integrating a k-hop AGE-GCN with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This framework leverages an attention mechanism to optimize functional connectivity (FC), thereby enhancing dynamic FC feature learning for brain disease classification. Furthermore, NeuroTree effectively decodes fMRI network features into tree structures, which improves the capture of high-order brain regional pathway features and enables the identification of hierarchical neural behavioral patterns essential for understanding disease-related brain subnetworks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroTree achieves state-of-the-art performance across two distinct mental disorder datasets and provides valuable insights into age-related deterioration patterns. These findings underscore the model's efficacy in predicting psychiatric disorders and elucidating their underlying neural mechanisms.</description>
