      <title>Comparative Study of RF Heating in Deep Brain Stimulation Devices During MRI at 1.5 T and 0.55 T: Challenging the Assumption of Safety at Low Field Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Low-field MRI has been assumed to be implant-friendly based on limited studies. However, RF-induced heating due to an implant is a complex resonance phenomenon, highly dependent on the implant's configurations and the applied RF frequencies. This study aims to evaluate the RF heating of DBS implants during MRI at low-field strengths compared to higher field 1.5 T MRI. Methods: A commercial deep brain stimulation (DBS) implant was used in full system as well as lead only configurations to evaluate and compare RF heating during MR imaging at 0.55 T and 1.5 T. The transfer function of the device at both configurations was measured and validated at each of the frequencies, which was then used for the in vivo prediction of RF heating for realistic DBS configurations at head, chest and abdomen imaging landmarks. Results: For the lead only case, the RF heating due to the DBS was substantially smaller during imaging at 0.55 T compared to that at 1.5 T. However, for the full DBS system (longer implant), the RF heating at 0.55 T was comparable to and for some cases even higher than that at 1.5 T, reaching a level that poses risk of tissue damage in patients. Conclusions: While RF heating generally tends to be lower at low-field MRI, the case with longer implanted leads demands extra caution, due to the higher possibility of matching resonant condition at low-field-strength frequencies. Thus, specific risk evaluation for each implant and configuration is required rather than assuming that lower field strength imaging is safer.</description>

      <title>A deep-learning model for one-shot transcranial ultrasound simulation and phase aberration correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound (TUS) has emerged as a promising tool in clinical and research settings due to its potential to modulate neuronal activity, open the blood-brain barrier, facilitate targeted drug delivery via nanoparticles, and perform thermal ablation, all non-invasively. By delivering focused ultrasound waves to precise regions anywhere in the brain, TUS enables targeted energy deposition and is being explored in over fifty clinical trials as a treatment for conditions such as opioid addiction, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, epilepsy, and glioblastoma. However, effective TUS treatment requires careful ultrasound parameter design and precise computation of the focal spot's location and pressure, as skull heterogeneity increases the risk of off-target sonication or insufficient energy delivery to neural tissue. In clinical settings, this phase aberration correction must be computed within seconds. To achieve this, commercial devices often rely on faster methods, such as ray tracing, to predict the focus location and pressure. While computationally efficient, these methods may not always provide the high level of accuracy needed for optimal TUS delivery. We present TUSNet, the first end-to-end deep learning approach to solve for both the pressure field and phase aberration corrections without being bound to the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. TUSNet computes the 2D transcranial ultrasound pressure field and phase corrections within 21 milliseconds (over $1200\times$ faster than k-Wave, a MATLAB-based acoustic simulation package), achieving $98.3\%$ accuracy in estimating peak pressure magnitude at the focal spot with a mean positioning error of only $0.18$ mm compared to ground truth from k-Wave.</description>

      <title>Photon-Counting CT in Cancer Radiotherapy: Technological Advances and Clinical Benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) marks a significant advancement over conventional energy-integrating detector (EID) CT systems. This review highlights PCCT's superior spatial and contrast resolution, reduced radiation dose, and multi-energy imaging capabilities, which address key challenges in radiotherapy, such as accurate tumor delineation, precise dose calculation, and treatment response monitoring. PCCT's improved anatomical clarity enhances tumor targeting while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Additionally, metal artifact reduction (MAR) and quantitative imaging capabilities optimize workflows, enabling adaptive radiotherapy and radiomics-driven personalized treatment. Emerging clinical applications in brachytherapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) show promising outcomes, although challenges like high costs and limited software integration remain. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and dedicated radiotherapy packages, PCCT is poised to transform precision, safety, and efficacy in cancer radiotherapy, marking it as a pivotal technology for future clinical practice.</description>

      <title>OAR-Weighted Dice Score: A spatially aware, radiosensitivity aware metric for target structure contour quality assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) is the current de facto standard to determine agreement between a reference segmentation and one generated by manual / auto-contouring approaches. This metric is useful for non-spatially important images; however, radiation therapy requires consideration of nearby Organs-at-Risk (OARs) and their radiosensitivity which are currently unaccounted for with the traditional DSC. In this work, we introduce the OAR-DSC which accounts for nearby OARs and their radiosensitivity when computing the DSC. We illustrate the importance of this through cases where two proposed contours have similar DSC, but lower OAR-DSC when one contour expands closer to the surrounding OARs. This work is important because the OAR-DSC may be used by deep learning auto-contouring algorithms in a radiation therapy specific loss function, thereby progressing on the current disregard for the importance of these differences on the final radiation dose plan generation, delivery, and risks of patient toxicity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers an inverse problem of reconstructing the spatially distributed complex dielectric permittivity function using backscattered data of the electric field in the frequency domain. We develop iterative algorithm for reconstruction of this function. Numerical example show the performance of the proposed algorithm in 2D. Additionally, we present at the first time the new prototype of the device for the malignant melanoma detection which is modelled in HFSS/Ansys. Results of measurements of scattered parameters in HFSS/Ansys show significant phase distortion in the case when melanoma is present compared to the case when melanoma is absent.</description>

      <title>Free-Running Time-Resolved First-Pass Myocardial Perfusion Using a Multi-Scale Dynamics Decomposition: CMR-MOTUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for the reconstruction of time-resolved free-running first-pass myocardial perfusion MRI, named CMR-MOTUS. This method builds upon the MR-MOTUS framework and addresses the challenges of a contrast varying reference image. By integrating a low-rank plus sparse (L+S) decomposition, CMR-MOTUS efficiently captures both motion fields and contrast variations. This innovative technique eliminates the need for acquiring a motion-static reference image prior to the examination, thereby reducing examination time and complexity for cardiac MRI examinations. Our results demonstrate that CMR-MOTUS can successfully disentangle different dynamic components, offering high-quality motion fields and motion correct a myocardial first-pass perfusion image series.</description>

      <title>Super-resolved virtual staining of label-free tissue using diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual staining of tissue offers a powerful tool for transforming label-free microscopy images of unstained tissue into equivalents of histochemically stained samples. This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing, a next-generation sequencing technology, holds the potential to revolutionize multiple facets of life sciences, forensics, and healthcare. While previous research has focused on its technical intricacies and biomedical applications, this paper offers a unique perspective by scrutinizing the societal dimensions (ethical, legal, and social implications) of nanopore sequencing. Employing the lenses of Diffusion and Action Network Theory, we examine the dissemination of nanopore sequencing in society as a potential consumer product, contributing to the field of the sociology of technology. We investigate the possibility of interactions between human and nonhuman actors in developing nanopore technology to analyse how various stakeholders, such as companies, regulators, and researchers, shape the trajectory of the growth of nanopore sequencing. This work offers insights into the social construction of nanopore sequencing, shedding light on the actors, power dynamics, and socio-technical networks that shape its adoption and societal impact. Understanding the sociological dimensions of this transformative technology is vital for responsible development, equitable distribution, and inclusive integration into diverse societal contexts.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>

      <title>A Personalized Fluid-structure Interaction Modeling Paradigm for Aorta in Human Fetuses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling, a technique widely used to enhance imaging modalities for adult and pediatric heart diseases, has been underutilized in the context of fetal circulation because of limited data on flow conditions and material properties. Recognizing the significant impact of congenital heart diseases on the fetal aorta, our research aims to address this gap by developing and validating a personalized FSI model for the fetal aorta.
  Our approach involved reconstructing the anatomy and flow of the fetal aorta using fetal echocardiography and ultrasound. We developed an innovative iterative method that includes: (i) an automated process for incorporating Windkessel models at outflow boundaries when clinical data is limited because of the resolution constraints of fetal imaging, (ii) an inverse approach to estimate bulk material properties, and (iii) an FSI model for high-fidelity hemodynamic evaluation. This method is efficient, typically converging in fewer than three iterations.
  We analyzed four normal fetal aortas with gestational ages ranging from 23.5 to 35.5 weeks to validate our workflow. We compared results with in vivo velocity waveforms across a cardiac cycle at the aortic isthmus. Strong correlations (R&gt;0.95) were observed. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the stiffness of the fetal aorta increases until 30 weeks of gestation and then decreases.
  This study marks a first-of-its-kind effort in developing a rigorously validated, personalized flow model for fetal circulation, offering novel insights into fetal aortic development and growth.</description>

      <title>CBCT scatter correction with dual-layer flat-panel detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Recently, the popularity of dual-layer flat-panel detector (DL-FPD) based dual-energy cone-beam CT (DE-CBCT) imaging has been increasing. However, the image quality of DE-CBCT remains constrained by the Compton scattered X-ray photons.
  Purpose: The objective of this study is to develop an energy-modulated scatter correction method for DL-FPD based CBCT imaging.
  Methods: In DL-FPD, a certain portion of the X-ray photons (mainly low-energy primary and scattered photons) passing through the object are captured by the top detector layer, while the remaining X-ray photons (mainly high-energy primary and scattered photons) are collected by the bottom detector layer. Based on the two set of distinct low-energy and high-energy measurements, a linear signal model was approximated for the dual-energy primary and scattered signals on DL-FPD. The distributions of X-ray scatters were quickly estimated using this signal model. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of a water phantom was conducted to verify this newly developed scatter estimation method. Moreover, physical experiments of water phantom, head phantom, and abdominal phantom were carried out to validate the real performance of this proposed scatter correction method.
  Results: The MC results showed that the e-Grid method was able to generate scatter distributions close to the ground truth. Moreover, the physical experiments demonstrated that the e-Grid method can greatly reduce the shading artifacts in both low-energy and high-energy CBCT images acquired from DL-FPD. On average, the image non-uniformity (NU) was reduced by over 77% in the low-energy CBCT image and by over 66% in the high-energy CBCT image. A a consequence, the accuracy of the decomposed multi-material bases was substantially improved.</description>
