      <title>Synthesis of Timeline-Based Planning Strategies Avoiding Determinization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent, but interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are governed by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called synchronization rules. Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata. However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed. In this paper, we identify a large fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then be exploited to synthesize strategies. In addition, we identify a  maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into such a deterministic fragment.

      <title>Epistemic Skills: Logical Dynamics of Knowing and Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a type of epistemic logics that encapsulates both the dynamics of acquiring knowledge (knowing) and losing information (forgetting), alongside the integration of group knowledge concepts. Our approach is underpinned by a system of weighted models, which introduces an "epistemic skills" metric to effectively represent the epistemic abilities associated with knowledge update. In this framework, the acquisition of knowledge is modeled as a result of upskilling, whereas forgetting is by downskilling. Additionally, our framework allows us to explore the concept of "knowability," which can be defined as the potential to acquire knowledge through upskilling, and facilitates a nuanced understanding of the distinctions between epistemic de re and de dicto expressions. We study the computational complexity of model checking problems for these logics, providing insights into both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications of our approach.</description>

      <title>The Days On Days Off Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personnel scheduling problems have received considerable academic attention due to their relevance in various real-world applications. These problems involve preparing feasible schedules for an organization's employees and often account for factors such as qualifications of workers and holiday requests, resulting in complex constraints. While certain versions of the personnel rostering problem are widely acknowledged as NP-hard, there is limited theoretical analysis specific to many of its variants. Many studies simply assert the NP-hardness of the general problem without investigating whether the specific cases they address inherit this computational complexity.
  In this paper, we examine a variant of the personnel scheduling problems, which involves scheduling a homogeneous workforce subject to constraints concerning both the total number and the number of consecutive work days and days off. This problem was claimed to be NP-complete by [Brunner+2013]. In this paper, we prove its NP-completeness and investigate how the combination of constraints contributes to this complexity. Furthermore, we analyze various special cases that arise from the omission of certain parameters, classifying them as either NP-complete or polynomial-time solvable. For the latter, we provide easy-to-implement and efficient algorithms to not only determine feasibility, but also compute a corresponding schedule.</description>

      <title>Limits of structures and Total NP Search Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an infinite class of finite graphs of unbounded size, we define a limit object, to be called a $\textit{wide limit}$, relative to some computationally restricted class of functions. The limit object is a first order Boolean-valued structure. The first order properties of the wide limit then reflect how a computationally restricted viewer "sees" a generic member of the class. The construction uses arithmetic forcing with random variables [Kraj\'i\v{c}ek, Forcing with random variables and proof complexity 2011]. We give sufficient conditions for universal and existential sentences to be valid in the limit, provide several examples, and prove that such a limit object can then be expanded to a model of weak arithmetic.
  To illustrate the concept we give an example in which the wide limit relates to total NP search problems. In particular, we take the wide limit of all maps from $\{0,\dots,k-1\}$ to $\{0,\dots,\lfloor k/2\rfloor-1\}$ to obtain a model of $\forall \text{PV}_1(f)$ where the problem $\textbf{RetractionWeakPigeon}$ is total but $\textbf{WeakPigeon}$, the complete problem for $\textbf{PWPP}$, is not. Thus, we obtain a new proof of this unprovability and show it implies that $\textbf{WeakPigeon}$ is not many-one reducible to $\textbf{RetractionWeakPigeon}$ in the oracle setting.</description>

      <title>Transductive Learning Is Compact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compactness result holding broadly across supervised learning with a general class of loss functions: Any hypothesis class $H$ is learnable with transductive sample complexity $m$ precisely when all of its finite projections are learnable with sample complexity $m$. We prove that this exact form of compactness holds for realizable and agnostic learning with respect to any proper metric loss function (e.g., any norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$) and any continuous loss on a compact space (e.g., cross-entropy, squared loss). For realizable learning with improper metric losses, we show that exact compactness of sample complexity can fail, and provide matching upper and lower bounds of a factor of 2 on the extent to which such sample complexities can differ. We conjecture that larger gaps are possible for the agnostic case. Furthermore, invoking the equivalence between sample complexities in the PAC and transductive models (up to lower order factors, in the realizable case) permits us to directly port our results to the PAC model, revealing an almost-exact form of compactness holding broadly in PAC learning.</description>
