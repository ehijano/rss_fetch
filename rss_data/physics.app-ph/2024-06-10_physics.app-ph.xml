      <title>Stabilizing Solution-Substrate Interaction of Perovskite Ink on PEDOT:PSS for Scalable Blade Coated Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Solar Modules by Gas Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of scalable 1.25 eV mixed Pb-Sn perovskite solar modules by blade coating lags behind Pb-based perovskites due to limited understanding of solution-substrate interaction of the perovskite ink on PEDOT:PSS and subsequent gas quenching. To address this challenge, we systematically studied the wet film deposition and quenching process to better understand narrow bandgap perovskite film formation on PEDOT:PSS. We found, the wetting of Pb-Sn perovskite ink on PEDOT:PSS is highly unstable over relevant coating time scales, causing the contact angles to decrease rapidly from 42{\deg} to 16{\deg} within seconds. This instability leads to localized irregularities in the wet film, resulting in uneven solvent extraction and inhomogeneous nuclei density. As a result, rough perovskite films with voids at the buried interface are obtained. To overcome this problem, we developed a quasi-static wetting process by reducing the blade coating speed, thereby stabilizing the wetting behavior of Pb-Sn perovskite precursor ink on PEDOT:PSS. This optimized process facilitates the deposition of high-quality, void-free Pb-Sn perovskite films with uniform thickness over 8 cm of coating length using moderate (1.4 bar) N2 quenching. We achieved 20 % efficient narrow bandgap perovskite solar cells and mini-modules with 15.8 % active area efficiency on 15.9 cm2.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Polarizability and Circuit Models for Waveguide-Fed Metamaterial Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common variant of a metasurface antenna consists of an array of metamaterial elements coupled to a waveguide feed. The guided wave excites the metamaterial elements, coupling energy from the waveguide mode to radiation. Under appropriate conditions, each sub-wavelength metamaterial element can be modeled as a polarizable dipole, with the polarizability determined by an extraction procedure from the computed or measured waveguide scattering parameters. Here we establish the equivalence of this polarizability description of a metamaterial element with an equivalent circuit model, providing an additional tool for metasurface design that offers significant insight and a path towards efficiently modeling very large apertures. With this equivalence established, more complicated external circuits that include lumped elements and devices such as diodes and transistors can be integrated into the metamaterial element, which can then be transformed into an equivalent polarizability for modeling in the coupled dipole framework. We derive appropriate circuit models for several basic metamaterial elements, which provide direct relationships between the equivalent circuit parameters of an element and its effective polarizability. These expressions are confirmed using scattering parameters for several example structures obtained via full-wave simulations.</description>

      <title>Significant dependence of the efficiency of energy-saving thermochromic VO$_2$ on slight changes of its properties in the visible due to strain and/or vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are worldwide efforts to maximize the energy saving achieved by VO$_2$-based thermochromic coatings. In particular, there are very different values of the modulation of integral solar energy transmittance, reported by various laboratories on various templates even for seemingly very similar coatings. A detailed analysis reveals that this is largely due to the combination of the intentional and well understood transmittance modulation in the infrared (always beneficial) with not yet understood slight transmittance modulation in the visible (sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful, and always multiplied by strong solar irradiance). Ab-initio calculations are used to examine the hypothesis that the transmittance modulation in the visible can be controlled by lattice strain and/or slightly off-stoichiometric [O]/[V] ratio. The presented phenomenon opens a pathway which may lead, in a case of reproducible preparation of correctly altered VO$_2$, to significantly enhanced energy saving.</description>

      <title>Modelling effects of moisture on mechanical properties of crosslinked polyurethane adhesives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crosslinked polyurethane adhesives show large deformation viscoelastic behaviour and age under the moisture influence because of their hygroscopic behaviour. The viscoelastic behaviour of the material is modelled with the micromechanical network model. The micromechanical model considers the shorter and longer chains with a probability distribution function. The network evolution concept is used to model softening of material due to the breakage of the shorter chains with an increase in deformation. The moisture diffusion in the polyurethane adhesive is behaviour, therefore Langmuir-type diffusion model is used to model moisture diffusion. The transported moisture in the material leads to an exponential decay in the mechanical properties causing the ageing of the material. The micromechanical model needs to be coupled with the Langmuir-type diffusion model to analyse the ageing process, where the mechanical properties are considered as the function of the local moisture concentration.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Integrated Photonic Receiver for Turbulence Compensation in Free Space Optical Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Free Space Optical (FSO) communication systems, atmospheric turbulence distorts the propagating beams, causing a random fading in the received power. This perturbation can be compensated using a multi-aperture receiver that samples the distorted wavefront on different points and adds the various signals coherently. In this work, we report on an adaptive optical receiver that compensates in real time for scintillation in FSO links. The optical front-end of the receiver is entirely integrated in a silicon photonic chip hosting a 2D Optical Antenna Array and a self-adaptive analog Programmable Optical Processor made of a mesh of tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers. The photonic chip acts as an adaptive interface to couple turbulent FSO beams to single-mode guided optics, enabling energy and cost-effective operation, scalability to systems with a larger number of apertures, modulation-format and data-protocol transparency, and pluggability with commercial fiber optics transceivers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed receiver with optical signals at a data rate of 10 Gbit/s transmitted in indoor FSO links where different turbulent conditions, even stronger than those expected in outdoor links of hundreds of meters, are reproduced.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Deep Learning and Phase Change Materials for Four-state Broadband Multifunctional Metasurfaces in the Visible Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we report, for the first time, broadband multifunctional metasurfaces with more than four distinct functionalities. The constituent meta-atoms combine two different phase change materials, $\mathrm{VO_2}$ and $\mathrm{Sb_2S_3}$ in a multi-stage configuration. FDTD simulations demonstrate a broadband reflection amplitude switching between the four states in visible range due to the enhanced cavity length modulation effect from the cascaded Fabry-Perot cavities, overcoming the inherent small optical contrast between the phase change material (PCM) states. This, along with the reflection phase control between the four states, allows us to incorporate both amplitude and phase-dependent properties in the same metasurface - achromatic deflection, wavelength beam splitting, achromatic focusing, and broadband absorption, overcoming the limitations of previous functionality switching mechanisms for the visible band. We have used a Tandem Neural network-based inverse design scheme to ensure the stringent requirements of different states are realized. We have used two forward networks for predicting the reflection amplitude and phase for a meta-atom within the pre-defined design space. The excellent prediction capability of these surrogate models is utilized to train the reverse network. The inverse design network, trained with a labeled data set, is capable of producing the optimized meta-units given the desired figure-of-merits in terms of reflection amplitude and phase for the four states. The optical characteristics of two inverse-designed metasurfaces have been evaluated as test cases for two different sets of design parameters in the four states. Both structures demonstrate the four desired broadband functionalities while closely matching the design requirements, suggesting their potential in visible-range portable medical imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Intracavity Coherent Up-conversion with Giant Nonlinearity in a Polar Fluidic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel microcavity-based photon up-conversion using second harmonic generation (SHG) from a polar nematic fluid media doped with a laser dye. The present idea is based on coherent light generation via simultaneous frequency doubling and stimulated emission (lasing) inside a microcavity. The polar nematic fluid equips very high even-order optical nonlinearity due to the polar symmetry and large dipole moment along the molecular long axis. At the same time, its inherent fluidic nature allows us to easily functionalize the media just by doping, in the present case, with an emissive laser dye. Our demonstrated system exhibits a giant nonlinear optical response to input light, while enabling spectral narrowing and multiple-signal output of up-converted light, that is not attainable though the simple SH-conversion of input light. Furthermore, susceptibility of the liquid crystal offers dynamic modulation capabilities under external stimulus, such as signal switching with electric field application or wavelength tuning through temperature variation. Such a brand-new type of simple coherent flexible up-conversion system must be promising as a new principle for easy-accessible and down-scalable wavelength conversion devices.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Bessel Beam Generation Using MetaMaterials in Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bessel beams, known for their unique non-diffracting property, maintain their shape and intensity over long distances, making them invaluable for applications in optical trapping, imaging, and communications. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of micro-photonic antennas designed to generate Bessel beams within the Terahertz (THz) and optical frequency ranges. The technique is demonstrated by generating far-field patterns of Bessel waves at these frequencies. The design employs metasurface patterns arranged as arrays of concentric rings atop rectangular silicon waveguides, collectively creating a Bessel beam. Dyadic Greens function integral equation techniques are used to model the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) fields in the metasurface radiation zone. Utilizing orthogonal vector wave functions, Bloch theorem, Floquet harmonics, and the transverse resonance technique, a photonic chip is designed to achieve a non-diffracting range of 500 um at the optical telecom wavelength of 1.5 um for a metasurface radius of 25 um. A radiation efficiency exceeding 80% is achieved by optimizing the attenuation constant (alpha) along the structure. The theoretical models are validated through simulations for both optical 1.5 um and Terahertz 14 um wavelengths, demonstrating significant alignment between predictions and simulation results.</description>

      <title>Hybrid terahertz emitter for pulse shaping and chirality control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) radiation, spanning from 0.3 to 3x10^12 Hz, fills the crucial gap between the microwave and infrared spectral range. THz technology has found applications in various fields, from imaging and sensing to telecommunication and biosensing. However, the full potential of these applications is often hindered by the need for precise control and manipulation of the frequency and polarization state, which typically requires external THz modulators. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid THz source that overcomes this limitation. Our device consists of two THz emitters integrated into one single device, enabling pulse shaping and chirality control of the emitted radiation without additional external components. The two sources are a spintronic emitter and a semiconductor photoconductive antenna (PCA). Using a combination of dual-wavelength excitation, allowing for control of the relative time delay between the two laser excitation pulses, and tuning external parameters for each emitter (i.e., biasing voltage for the PCA and magnetic field for the spintronic THz emitter) enables precise control of the mixing of the two signals and results in frequency, polarization, and chirality control of the overall THz radiation. This on-chip hybrid emitter provides an essential platform for engineered THz radiation with wide-ranging potential applications.</description>

      <title>Near-field radiative heat transfer between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the near-field radiative heat transfer between a normally and/or laterally shifted nanoparticle and a planar fused silica slab coated with a strip graphene grating. For this study we develop and use a scattering matrix approach derived from Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions. We find that adding a graphene sheet coating on the slab can already enhance the heat flux by about 85%. We show that by patterning the graphene sheet coating into a grating, the heat flux is further increased, and this happens thanks to the a topological transition of the plasmonic modes from circular to hyperbolic one, which allows for more energy transfer. The lateral shift affects the accessible range of high-$k$ modes and thus affects the heat flux, too. By moving the nanoparticle laterally above the graphene grating, we can obtain an optimal heat flux with strong chemical potential dependance above the strips. For a fixed graphene grating period ($D=1\mu$m) and not too large normal shift (separation $d&lt;800$nm), two different types of lateral shift effects (e.g., enhancement and inhibition) on heat transfer have been observed. As the separation $d$ is further increased, the lateral shift effect becomes less important. We show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$. Two distinct asymptotic regimes are proposed: (1) the inhibition regime ($d/D&lt;0.85$), where the lateral shift reduces the heat transfer, and (2) the neutral regime ($d/D \geq 0.85$) where the effect of the lateral shift is negligible. In general, we can say that the geometric factor $d/D \approx 0.85$ is a critical point for the lateral shift effect. Our predictions can have relevant implications to the radiative heat transfer and energy management at the nano/micro scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precisely stabilizing laser frequency is crucial for advancing laser technology and unlocking the full potential of various quantum technologies. Here, we propose a compact device for stabilizing frequency of a semiconductor laser through mode coupling effects, which provides enhanced sensitivity. Our proposed architecture features a main ridge waveguide with a Bragg grating, flanked by two curved ridge waveguides. This configuration exhibits an optical phenomenon characterized by a transmission crossing at the wavelength of the Bragg grating. Using particle swarm optimization strategy and employing efficient figures of merit, we achieve a high transmission crossing. The observed asymmetric transmission crossing not only holds the promise for an efficient and compact on-chip laser frequency stabilizer, but also fosters the development of novel sensing platforms with heightened sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: Colloidal self-assembly allows rational design of structures on the micrometer and submicrometer scale. One architecture that can generate complete 3D photonic band gaps is the diamond cubic lattice, which has remained difficult to realize at length scales comparable to the wavelength of visible or ultraviolet light. Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional photonic crystals self-assembled from DNA origami that act as precisely programmable patchy colloids. Our DNA-based nanoscale tetrapods crystallize into a rod-connected diamond cubic lattice with a periodicity of 170 nm. This structure serves as a scaffold for atomic layer deposition of high refractive index materials such as TiO$_2$, yielding a tunable photonic band gap in the near-ultraviolet.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces for infrared multi-modal microscopy: phase contrast and bright field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different imaging modalities are used to extract the diverse information carried in an optical field. Two prominent modalities include bright field and phase contrast microscopy that can visualize the amplitude and phase features of a sample, respectively. However, capturing both of these images on the same camera typically requires interchanging optical components. Metasurfaces are ultra-thin nanostructures that can merge both of these operations into a single miniaturized device. Here, a silicon-based metasurface that supports a Mie resonance is demonstrated to perform near-infrared phase contrast and bright field multi-modal microscopy that can be tuned by changing the polarization of the illumination. We performed experiments using optical fields with phase variations synthesized by a spatial light modulator and introduced by propagation through semi-transparent samples, including C. elegans, unstained human prostate cancer cells and breast tissue. The results demonstrate the potential of metasurfaces for label-free point-of-care testing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in quantum computing is speeding up measurement and initialization. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a dispersive measurement method for superconducting qubits that simultaneously measures the qubit and returns the readout resonator to its initial state. The approach is based on universal analytical pulses and requires knowledge of the qubit and resonator parameters, but needs no direct optimization of the pulse shape, even when accounting for the nonlinearity of the system. Moreover, the method generalizes to measuring an arbitrary number of modes and states. For the qubit readout, we can drive the resonator to $\sim 10^2$ photons and back to $\sim 10^{-3}$ photons in less than $3 \kappa^{-1}$, while still achieving a $T_1$-limited assignment error below 1\%. We also present universal pulse shapes and experimental results for qutrit readout.</description>
