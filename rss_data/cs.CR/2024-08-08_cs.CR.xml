      <title>Explainable AI-based Intrusion Detection System for Industry 5.0: An Overview of the Literature, associated Challenges, the existing Solutions, and Potential Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry 5.0, which focuses on human and Artificial Intelligence (AI) collaboration for performing different tasks in manufacturing, involves a higher number of robots, Internet of Things (IoTs) devices and interconnections, Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR), and other smart devices. The huge involvement of these devices and interconnection in various critical areas, such as economy, health, education and defense systems, poses several types of potential security flaws. AI itself has been proven a very effective and powerful tool in different areas of cybersecurity, such as intrusion detection, malware detection, and phishing detection, among others. Just as in many application areas, cybersecurity professionals were reluctant to accept black-box ML solutions for cybersecurity applications. This reluctance pushed forward the adoption of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) as a tool that helps explain how decisions are made in ML-based systems. In this survey, we present a comprehensive study of different XAI-based intrusion detection systems for industry 5.0, and we also examine the impact of explainability and interpretability on Cybersecurity practices through the lens of Adversarial XIDS (Adv-XIDS) approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the possible opportunities and challenges in XAI cybersecurity systems for industry 5.0 that elicit future research toward XAI-based solutions to be adopted by high-stakes industry 5.0 applications. We believe this rigorous analysis will establish a foundational framework for subsequent research endeavors within the specified domain.</description>

      <title>The Use of Large Language Models (LLM) for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) in Cybercrime Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03354v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data from cybercrime forums, which contain extensive information and key discussions about emerging cyber threats. However, to date, the level of accuracy and efficiency of LLMs for such critical tasks has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Hence, this study assesses the accuracy of an LLM system built on the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model [7] to extract CTI information. To do so, a random sample of 500 daily conversations from three cybercrime forums, XSS, Exploit_in, and RAMP, was extracted, and the LLM system was instructed to summarize the conversations and code 10 key CTI variables, such as whether a large organization and/or a critical infrastructure is being targeted. Then, two coders reviewed each conversation and evaluated whether the information extracted by the LLM was accurate. The LLM system performed strikingly well, with an average accuracy score of 98%. Various ways to enhance the model were uncovered, such as the need to help the LLM distinguish between stories and past events, as well as being careful with verb tenses in prompts. Nevertheless, the results of this study highlight the efficiency and relevance of using LLMs for cyber threat intelligence.</description>

      <title>Attacks and Defenses for Generative Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various generative tasks such as image synthesis, text-to-image, and text-guided image-to-image generation. However, the more powerful the DMs, the more harmful they potentially are. Recent studies have shown that DMs are prone to a wide range of attacks, including adversarial attacks, membership inference, backdoor injection, and various multi-modal threats. Since numerous pre-trained DMs are published widely on the Internet, potential threats from these attacks are especially detrimental to the society, making DM-related security a worth investigating topic. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the security aspect of DMs, focusing on various attack and defense methods for DMs. First, we present crucial knowledge of DMs with five main types of DMs, including denoising diffusion probabilistic models, denoising diffusion implicit models, noise conditioned score networks, stochastic differential equations, and multi-modal conditional DMs. We further survey a variety of recent studies investigating different types of attacks that exploit the vulnerabilities of DMs. Then, we thoroughly review potential countermeasures to mitigate each of the presented threats. Finally, we discuss open challenges of DM-related security and envision certain research directions for this topic.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Infrastructure Used in Web-based Cryptojacking: A Measurement Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper conducts a comprehensive examination of the infrastructure supporting cryptojacking operations. The analysis elucidates the methodologies, frameworks, and technologies malicious entities employ to misuse computational resources for unauthorized cryptocurrency mining. The investigation focuses on identifying websites serving as platforms for cryptojacking activities. A dataset of 887 websites, previously identified as cryptojacking sites, was compiled and analyzed to categorize the attacks and malicious activities observed. The study further delves into the DNS IP addresses, registrars, and name servers associated with hosting these websites to understand their structure and components. Various malware and illicit activities linked to these sites were identified, indicating the presence of unauthorized cryptocurrency mining via compromised sites. The findings highlight the vulnerability of website infrastructures to cryptojacking.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the vulnerability of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to very simple single-feature adversarial attacks in the context of Ethereum fraudulent transaction detection. Through comprehensive experimentation, we investigate the impact of various adversarial attack strategies on model performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings, highlighting how prone those techniques are to simple attacks, are alarming, and the inconsistency in the attacks' effect on different algorithms promises ways for attack mitigation. We examine the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies, including adversarial training and enhanced feature selection, in enhancing model robustness.</description>

      <title>Beyond App Markets: Demystifying Underground Mobile App Distribution Via Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thriving mobile app ecosystem encompasses a wide range of functionalities. However, within this ecosystem, a subset of apps provides illicit services such as gambling and pornography to pursue economic gains, collectively referred to as "underground economy apps". While previous studies have examined these apps' characteristics and identification methods, investigations into their distribution via platforms beyond app markets (like Telegram) remain scarce, which has emerged as a crucial channel for underground activities and cybercrime due to the robust encryption and user anonymity.
  This study provides the first comprehensive exploration of the underground mobile app ecosystem on Telegram. Overcoming the complexities of the Telegram environment, we build a novel dataset and analyze the prevalence, promotional strategies, and characteristics of these apps. Our findings reveal that these apps reach approximately 1% of Telegram's user base, primarily catering to gambling and pornography services. We uncover sophisticated promotional strategies involving complex networks of apps, websites, users, and channels, and identify significant gaps in Telegram's content moderation capabilities. Our analysis also exposes the misuse of iOS features for app distribution and the prevalence of malicious behaviors in these apps. This research not only enhances our understanding of the underground app ecosystem but also provides valuable insights for developing effective regulatory measures and protecting users from potential risks associated with these covert operations. Our findings provide implications for platform regulators, app market operators, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity professionals in combating the proliferation of underground apps on encrypted messaging platforms.</description>

      <title>MPC-Minimized Secure LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many inference services based on large language models (LLMs) pose a privacy concern, either revealing user prompts to the service or the proprietary weights to the user. Secure inference offers a solution to this problem through secure multi-party computation (MPC), however, it is still impractical for modern LLM workload due to the large overhead imposed by MPC. To address this overhead, we propose Marill, a framework that adapts LLM fine-tuning to minimize MPC usage during secure inference. Marill introduces high-level architectural changes during fine-tuning that significantly reduce the number of expensive operations needed within MPC during inference, by removing some and relocating others outside MPC without compromising security. As a result, Marill-generated models are more efficient across all secure inference protocols and our approach complements MPC-friendly approximations for such operations. Compared to standard fine-tuning, Marill results in 3.6-11.3x better runtime and 2.4-6.9x better communication during secure inference across various MPC settings, while typically preserving over 90% performance across downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Privacy Threat Modeling Complexity: Conceptual Privacy Analysis Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing privacy threats in software products is an essential part of software development to ensure systems are privacy-respecting; yet it is still a far from trivial activity. While there have been many advancements in the past decade, they tend to focus on describing 'what' the threats are. What isn't entirely clear yet is 'how' to actually find these threats. Privacy is a complex domain. We propose to use four conceptual layers (feature, ecosystem, business context, and environment) to capture this privacy complexity. These layers can be used as a frame to structure and specify the privacy analysis support in a more tangible and actionable way, thereby improving applicability of the analysis process.</description>

      <title>EnJa: Ensemble Jailbreak on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in safety-critical applications, their vulnerability to potential jailbreaks -- malicious prompts that can disable the safety mechanism of LLMs -- has attracted growing research attention. While alignment methods have been proposed to protect LLMs from jailbreaks, many have found that aligned LLMs can still be jailbroken by carefully crafted malicious prompts, producing content that violates policy regulations. Existing jailbreak attacks on LLMs can be categorized into prompt-level methods which make up stories/logic to circumvent safety alignment and token-level attack methods which leverage gradient methods to find adversarial tokens. In this work, we introduce the concept of Ensemble Jailbreak and explore methods that can integrate prompt-level and token-level jailbreak into a more powerful hybrid jailbreak attack. Specifically, we propose a novel EnJa attack to hide harmful instructions using prompt-level jailbreak, boost the attack success rate using a gradient-based attack, and connect the two types of jailbreak attacks via a template-based connector. We evaluate the effectiveness of EnJa on several aligned models and show that it achieves a state-of-the-art attack success rate with fewer queries and is much stronger than any individual jailbreak.</description>

      <title>BioDeepHash: Mapping Biometrics into a Stable Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the wide application of biometrics, more and more attention has been paid to the security of biometric templates. However most of existing biometric template protection (BTP) methods have some security problems, e.g. the problem that protected templates leak part of the original biometric data (exists in Cancelable Biometrics (CB)), the use of error-correcting codes (ECC) leads to decodable attack, statistical attack (exists in Biometric Cryptosystems (BCS)), the inability to achieve revocability (exists in methods using Neural Network (NN) to learn pre-defined templates), the inability to use cryptographic hash to guarantee strong security (exists in CB and methods using NN to learn latent templates). In this paper, we propose a framework called BioDeepHash based on deep hashing and cryptographic hashing to address the above four problems, where different biometric data of the same user are mapped to a stable code using deep hashing instead of predefined binary codes thus avoiding the use of ECC. An application-specific binary string is employed to achieve revocability. Then cryptographic hashing is used to get the final protected template to ensure strong security. Ultimately our framework achieves not storing any data that would leak part of the original biometric data. We also conduct extensive experiments on facial and iris datasets. Our method achieves an improvement of 10.12$\%$ on the average Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) for iris data and 3.12$\%$ for facial data compared to existing methods. In addition, BioDeepHash achieves extremely low False Acceptance Rate (FAR), i.e. 0$\%$ FAR on the iris dataset and the highest FAR on the facial dataset is only 0.0002$\%$.</description>

      <title>Centralized Defense: Logging and Mitigation of Kubernetes Misconfigurations with Open Source Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kubernetes, an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, is widely used for its efficiency and scalability. However, its complexity and extensive configuration options often lead to security vulnerabilities if not managed properly. This paper presents a detailed analysis of misconfigurations in Kubernetes environments and their significant impact on system reliability and security. A centralized logging solution was developed to detect such misconfigurations, detailing the integration process with a Kubernetes cluster and the implementation of role-based access control. Utilizing a combination of open-source tools, the solution systematically identifies misconfigurations and aggregates diagnostic data into a central repository. The effectiveness of the solution was evaluated using specific metrics, such as the total cycle time for running the central logging solution against the individual open source tools.</description>

      <title>MTDSense: AI-Based Fingerprinting of Moving Target Defense Techniques in Software-Defined Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving target defenses (MTD) are proactive security techniques that enhance network security by confusing the attacker and limiting their attack window. MTDs have been shown to have significant benefits when evaluated against traditional network attacks, most of which are automated and untargeted. However, little has been done to address an attacker who is aware the network uses an MTD. In this work, we propose a novel approach named MTDSense, which can determine when the MTD has been triggered using the footprints the MTD operation leaves in the network traffic. MTDSense uses unsupervised clustering to identify traffic following an MTD trigger and extract the MTD interval. An attacker can use this information to maximize their attack window and tailor their attacks, which has been shown to significantly reduce the effectiveness of MTD. Through analyzing the attacker's approach, we propose and evaluate two new MTD update algorithms that aim to reduce the information leaked into the network by the MTD. We present an extensive experimental evaluation by creating, to our knowledge, the first dataset of the operation of an IP-shuffling MTD in a software-defined network. Our work reveals that despite previous results showing the effectiveness of MTD as a defense, traditional implementations of MTD are highly susceptible to a targeted attacker.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerabilities, caused by unintentional flaws in source code, are a primary root cause of cyberattacks. Static analysis of source code has been widely used to detect these unintentional defects introduced by software developers. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like conversational abilities due to their capacity to capture complex patterns in sequential data, such as natural languages. In this paper, we harness LLMs' capabilities to analyze source code and detect known vulnerabilities. To ensure the proposed vulnerability detection method is universal across multiple programming languages, we convert source code to LLVM IR and train LLMs on these intermediate representations. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures and compare their accuracy. Our comprehensive experiments on real-world and synthetic codes from NVD and SARD demonstrate high accuracy in identifying source code vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of Large Vision-Language Models against Goal Hijacking via Visual Prompt Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore visual prompt injection (VPI) that maliciously exploits the ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to follow instructions drawn onto the input image. We propose a new VPI method, "goal hijacking via visual prompt injection" (GHVPI), that swaps the execution task of LVLMs from an original task to an alternative task designated by an attacker. The quantitative analysis indicates that GPT-4V is vulnerable to the GHVPI and demonstrates a notable attack success rate of 15.8%, which is an unignorable security risk. Our analysis also shows that successful GHVPI requires high character recognition capability and instruction-following ability in LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the decoding-to-LPN reduction via code smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem underlines several classic cryptographic primitives. Researchers have endeavored to demonstrate the algorithmic difficulty of this problem by attempting to find a reduction from the decoding problem of linear codes, for which several hardness results exist. Earlier studies used code smoothing as a technical tool to achieve such reductions, showing that they are possible for codes with vanishing rate. This has left open the question of attaining a reduction with positive-rate codes. Addressing this case, we characterize the efficiency of the reduction in terms of the parameters of the decoding and LPN problems. As a conclusion, we isolate the parameter regimes for which a meaningful reduction is possible and the regimes for which its existence is unlikely.</description>

      <title>Speech privacy-preserving methods using secret key for convolutional neural network models and their robustness evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose privacy-preserving methods with a secret key for convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models in speech processing tasks. In environments where untrusted third parties, like cloud servers, provide CNN-based systems, ensuring the privacy of speech queries becomes essential. This paper proposes encryption methods for speech queries using secret keys and a model structure that allows for encrypted queries to be accepted without decryption. Our approach introduces three types of secret keys: Shuffling, Flipping, and random orthogonal matrix (ROM). In experiments, we demonstrate that when the proposed methods are used with the correct key, identification performance did not degrade. Conversely, when an incorrect key is used, the performance significantly decreased. Particularly, with the use of ROM, we show that even with a relatively small key space, high privacy-preserving performance can be maintained many speech processing tasks. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the difficulty of recovering original speech from encrypted queries in various robustness evaluations.</description>

      <title>LaFA: Latent Feature Attacks on Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) applications rapidly grow, concerns about adversarial attacks compromising their reliability have gained significant attention. One unsupervised ML method known for its resilience to such attacks is Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), an algorithm that decomposes input data into lower-dimensional latent features. However, the introduction of powerful computational tools such as Pytorch enables the computation of gradients of the latent features with respect to the original data, raising concerns about NMF's reliability. Interestingly, naively deriving the adversarial loss for NMF as in the case of ML would result in the reconstruction loss, which can be shown theoretically to be an ineffective attacking objective. In this work, we introduce a novel class of attacks in NMF termed Latent Feature Attacks (LaFA), which aim to manipulate the latent features produced by the NMF process. Our method utilizes the Feature Error (FE) loss directly on the latent features. By employing FE loss, we generate perturbations in the original data that significantly affect the extracted latent features, revealing vulnerabilities akin to those found in other ML techniques. To handle large peak-memory overhead from gradient back-propagation in FE attacks, we develop a method based on implicit differentiation which enables their scaling to larger datasets. We validate NMF vulnerabilities and FE attacks effectiveness through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Fingerprinting Image-to-Image Generative Adversarial Networks</title>

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used in various application scenarios. Since the production of a commercial GAN requires substantial computational and human resources, the copyright protection of GANs is urgently needed. This paper presents a novel fingerprinting scheme for the Intellectual Property (IP) protection of image-to-image GANs based on a trusted third party. We break through the stealthiness and robustness bottlenecks suffered by previous fingerprinting methods for classification models being naively transferred to GANs. Specifically, we innovatively construct a composite deep learning model from the target GAN and a classifier. Then we generate fingerprint samples from this composite model, and embed them in the classifier for effective ownership verification. This scheme inspires some concrete methodologies to practically protect the modern image-to-image translation GANs. Theoretical analysis proves that these methods can satisfy different security requirements necessary for IP protection. We also conduct extensive experiments to show that our solutions outperform existing strategies.</description>

      <title>Improving the Privacy Loss Under User-Level DP Composition for Fixed Estimation Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the private release of statistics of several disjoint subsets of a datasets. In particular, we consider the $\epsilon$-user-level differentially private release of sample means and variances of sample values in disjoint subsets of a dataset, in a potentially sequential manner. Traditional analysis of the privacy loss under user-level privacy due to the composition of queries to the disjoint subsets necessitates a privacy loss degradation by the total number of disjoint subsets. Our main contribution is an iterative algorithm, based on suppressing user contributions, which seeks to reduce the overall privacy loss degradation under a canonical Laplace mechanism, while not increasing the worst estimation error among the subsets. Important components of this analysis are our exact, analytical characterizations of the sensitivities and the worst-case bias errors of estimators of the sample mean and variance, which are obtained by clipping or suppressing user contributions. We test the performance of our algorithm on real-world and synthetic datasets and demonstrate improvements in the privacy loss degradation factor, for fixed estimation error. We also show improvements in the worst-case error across subsets, via a natural optimization procedure, for fixed numbers of users contributing to each subset.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing Data Privacy in Federated Unlearning with Dynamic User Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) is gaining prominence for its capability to eliminate influences of Federated Learning (FL) users' data from trained global FL models. A straightforward FU method involves removing the unlearned users and subsequently retraining a new global FL model from scratch with all remaining users, a process that leads to considerable overhead. To enhance unlearning efficiency, a widely adopted strategy employs clustering, dividing FL users into clusters, with each cluster maintaining its own FL model. The final inference is then determined by aggregating the majority vote from the inferences of these sub-models. This method confines unlearning processes to individual clusters for removing a user, thereby enhancing unlearning efficiency by eliminating the need for participation from all remaining users. However, current clustering-based FU schemes mainly concentrate on refining clustering to boost unlearning efficiency but overlook the potential information leakage from FL users' gradients, a privacy concern that has been extensively studied. Typically, integrating secure aggregation (SecAgg) schemes within each cluster can facilitate a privacy-preserving FU. Nevertheless, crafting a clustering methodology that seamlessly incorporates SecAgg schemes is challenging, particularly in scenarios involving adversarial users and dynamic users. In this connection, we systematically explore the integration of SecAgg protocols within the most widely used federated unlearning scheme, which is based on clustering, to establish a privacy-preserving FU framework, aimed at ensuring privacy while effectively managing dynamic user participation. Comprehensive theoretical assessments and experimental results show that our proposed scheme achieves comparable unlearning effectiveness, alongside offering improved privacy protection and resilience in the face of varying user participation.</description>

      <title>SoK: Attacks on DAOs</title>

Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are blockchain-based organizations that facilitate decentralized governance. Today, DAOs not only hold billions of dollars in their treasury but also govern many of the most popular Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. This paper systematically analyses security threats to DAOs, focusing on the types of attacks they face. We study attacks on DAOs that took place in the past, attacks that have been theorized to be possible, and potential attacks that were uncovered and prevented in audits. For each of these (potential) attacks, we describe and categorize the attack vectors utilized into four categories. This reveals that while many attacks on DAOs take advantage of the less tangible and more complex human nature involved in governance, audits tend to focus on code and protocol vulnerabilities. Thus, additionally, the paper examines empirical data on DAO vulnerabilities, outlines risk factors contributing to these attacks, and suggests mitigation strategies to safeguard against such vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Diffie-Hellman Picture Show: Key Exchange Stories from Commercial VoWiFi Deployments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWiFi) uses a series of IPsec tunnels to deliver IP-based telephony from the subscriber's phone (User Equipment, UE) into the Mobile Network Operator's (MNO) core network via an Internet-facing endpoint, the Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG). IPsec tunnels are set up in phases. The first phase negotiates the cryptographic algorithm and parameters and performs a key exchange via the Internet Key Exchange protocol, while the second phase (protected by the above-established encryption) performs the authentication. An insecure key exchange would jeopardize the later stages and the data's security and confidentiality.
  In this paper, we analyze the phase 1 settings and implementations as they are found in phones as well as in commercially deployed networks worldwide. On the UE side, we identified a recent 5G baseband chipset from a major manufacturer that allows for fallback to weak, unannounced modes and verified it experimentally. On the MNO side -- among others -- we identified 13 operators (totaling an estimated 140 million subscribers) on three continents that all use the same globally static set of ten private keys, serving them at random. Those not-so-private keys allow the decryption of the shared keys of every VoWiFi user of all those operators. All these operators deployed their core network from one common manufacturer.</description>

      <title>Privacy Perceptions and Behaviors of Google Personal Account Holders in Saudi Arabia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10148v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While privacy perceptions and behaviors have been investigated in Western societies, little is known about these issues in non-Western societies. To bridge this gap, we interviewed 30 Google personal account holders in Saudi Arabia about their privacy perceptions and behaviors regarding the activity data that Google saves about them. Our study focuses on Google's Activity Controls, which enable users to control whether, and how, Google saves their Web \&amp; App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History. Our results show that although most participants have some level of awareness about Google's data practices and the Activity Controls, many have only vague awareness, and the majority have not used the available controls. When participants viewed their saved activity data, many were surprised by what had been saved. While many participants find Google's use of their data to improve the services provided to them acceptable, the majority find the use of their data for ad purposes unacceptable. We observe that our Saudi participants exhibit similar trends and patterns in privacy awareness, attitudes, preferences, concerns, and behaviors to what has been found in studies in the US. Our results emphasize the need for: 1) improved techniques to inform users about privacy settings during account sign-up, to remind users about their settings, and to raise awareness about privacy settings; 2) improved privacy setting interfaces to reduce the costs that deter many users from changing the settings; and 3) further research to explore privacy concerns in non-Western cultures.</description>

      <title>Prompt Public Large Language Models to Synthesize Data for Private On-device Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-training on public data is an effective method to improve the performance for federated learning (FL) with differential privacy (DP). This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) trained on public data can improve the quality of pre-training data for the on-device language models trained with DP and FL. We carefully design LLM prompts to filter and transform existing public data, and generate new data to resemble the real user data distribution. The model pre-trained on our synthetic dataset achieves relative improvement of 19.0% and 22.8% in next word prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model pre-trained on a standard public dataset, when evaluated over the real user data in Gboard (Google Keyboard, a production mobile keyboard application). Furthermore, our method achieves evaluation accuracy better than or comparable to the baseline during the DP FL fine-tuning over millions of mobile devices, and our final model outperforms the baseline in production A/B testing. Our experiments demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in synthesizing data close to the private distribution even without accessing the private data, and also suggest future research directions to further reduce the distribution gap.</description>

      <title>Investigating and Defending Shortcut Learning in Personalized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized diffusion models have gained popularity for adapting pre-trained text-to-image models to generate images of specific topics with minimal training data. However, these models are vulnerable to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to degraded performance on corrupted datasets. Such vulnerabilities are further exploited to craft protective perturbations on sensitive images like portraits that prevent unauthorized generation. In response, diffusion-based purification methods have been proposed to remove these perturbations and retain generation performance. However, existing works turn to over-purifying the images, which causes information loss. In this paper, we take a closer look at the fine-tuning process of personalized diffusion models through the lens of shortcut learning. And we propose a hypothesis explaining the manipulation mechanisms of existing perturbation methods, demonstrating that perturbed images significantly deviate from their original prompts in the CLIP-based latent space. This misalignment during fine-tuning causes models to associate noisy patterns with identifiers, resulting in performance degradation. Based on these insights, we introduce a systematic approach to maintain training performance through purification. Our method first purifies the images to realign them with their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive learning with negative tokens to decouple the learning of clean identities from noisy patterns, which shows a strong potential capacity against adaptive perturbation. Our study uncovers shortcut learning vulnerabilities in personalized diffusion models and provides a firm evaluation framework for future protective perturbation research.

Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>

      <title>Malicious Internet Entity Detection Using Local Graph Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of malicious behavior in a large network is a challenging problem for machine learning in computer security, since it requires a model with high expressive power and scalable inference. Existing solutions struggle to achieve this feat -- current cybersec-tailored approaches are still limited in expressivity, and methods successful in other domains do not scale well for large volumes of data, rendering frequent retraining impossible. This work proposes a new perspective for learning from graph data that is modeling network entity interactions as a large heterogeneous graph. High expressivity of the method is achieved with neural network architecture HMILnet that naturally models this type of data and provides theoretical guarantees. The scalability is achieved by pursuing local graph inference, i.e., classifying individual vertices and their neighborhood as independent samples. Our experiments exhibit improvement over the state-of-the-art Probabilistic Threat Propagation (PTP) algorithm, show a further threefold accuracy improvement when additional data is used, which is not possible with the PTP algorithm, and demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the method to new, previously unseen entities.</description>
