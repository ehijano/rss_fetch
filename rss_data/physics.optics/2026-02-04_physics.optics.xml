      <title>Extrinsic Limitations of Stealthy Hyperuniform Optical Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform metasurfaces promise an unusual form of wave control: the suppression of elastic scattering over extended angular ranges without periodic order. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of 2D stealthy hyperuniform metasurfaces operating at optical frequencies. In agreement with theoretical expectations, we observe a pronounced reduction of elastic scattering around the specular direction in metasurfaces fabricated by electron-beam lithography. However, the measured suppression is substantially weaker than that predicted by structure-factor calculations based on ideal stealthy hyperuniform point-pattern generators. We identify and quantitatively analyze the physical origins of this discrepancy, and establish realistic performance bounds. By isolating the dominant limiting mechanisms, our results provide practical design guidelines for the implementation of stealthy hyperuniform metasurfaces in functional photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Gear-based 3D-printed Micromachines Actuated by Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturization of mechanical mechanisms is crucial to enable the development of compact, high-performance micromachines. However, the downscaling actuation of conventional gears and micromotors has remained limited by the inherent challenges of implementing mechanical/electrical powering. Here, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of an optomechanical, gear-driven micromachine realized through two-photon polymerization 3D printing. The actuation is achieved using optical tweezers. The device integrates a microgear transmission system with an optically actuated part, enabling light-controlled micromachines. When illuminated by a highly focused laser source, the first gear generates rotational torque within the gear assembly, converting optical energy into directional mechanical work that can be transmitted to the coupled gear. We demonstrate the fabrication of micromachines using two-photon polymerization (2PP) laser writing, enabling the fabrication of spur gear trains and bevel gears that can produce out-of-plane rotations, which is not achievable with traditional micromachining fabrication techniques. The micromachines are composed of a single gear or a train of two or three gears without any unwanted adhesion between the components, leading to functioning systems. Experimentally, the fabricated micromachines were actuated using optical tweezers, demonstrating continuous gear rotation, effective motion transmission in gear trains, out-of-plane rotations, and the ability to amplify velocity or torque. Optical-tweezer actuation broadens the potential applications of these micromachines, particularly in biomedical and lab-on-a-chip systems, where precise, minimally invasive control at the microscale is essential.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved dynamics of semiconductor nanolaser via four-wave mixing gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the direct time-domain characterization of photonic-crystal nanolasers at telecom wavelengths using a nonlinear optical gating technique based on four-wave mixing. This approach enables the temporal characterization of the ultrafast emission dynamics under short-pulse excitation with picosecond time resolution. When a weak continuous-wave component is added to the pulsed pump, the emission becomes deterministic and the build-up time is considerably reduced. The difference between purely pulsed and hybrid excitation regimes points to the influence of pulse-to-pulse timing fluctuations. To elucidate this effect, we perform Langevin-based simulations that reproduce the experimentally observed broadening and confirm that time jitter, originating from spontaneous-emission noise near threshold, dominates the temporal dispersion. These results establish four-wave-mixing gating as a powerful method to probe nanolaser dynamics with picosecond precision.</description>

      <title>Planar Scale Invariant Waveguides and Resonators with Uniform Air Confined Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a planar metamaterial based resonator and waveguide with strong light confinement in air based on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform that exhibits scale invariance in the lateral direction. By embedding a sub wavelength grating (SWG) region between two silicon ridges, the waveguide maintains a nearly constant effective index across varying widths while sustaining a uniform field distribution. Simulations and experimental measurements using Mach Zehnder interferometers confirm scale invariance, and racetrack resonators fabricated from the same structure exhibit an intrinsic quality factor of 40000. The ability of the resonance based structures for confining light in air, providing large interaction regions with high quality factors along with compatibility with CMOS fabrication processes and robustness against fabrication imperfections make them excellent candidates for enhanced light matter interaction applications with improved power handling, offering a promising platform for integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Control of Extreme Events in a semiconductor VCSEL via Polarization-Engineered Optical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme events, or rogue waves, are high-amplitude, rare occurrences that emerge across diverse physical systems and often defy conventional statistical predictions. While optical systems provide a controlled setting for studying these phenomena, achieving deterministic control over their generation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to induce and precisely modulate extreme events in a semiconductor VCSEL using polarization-controlled optical feedback. By integrating a $\lambda$/2-waveplate into a polarization-selective external cavity, we regulate the nonlinear interaction between TE and TM modes. This setup triggers high-intensity, heavy-tailed fluctuations in the TM mode, exhibiting clear signatures of extreme events. We show that these events arise from deterministic energy exchange between modes, as evidenced by strong bipolar correlations and long-range temporal memory. The waveplate angle serves as an effective external parameter, enabling non-monotonic tuning of the event rate, intensity, and temporal clustering. Our study establish a platform for exploring extreme events in dissipative systems, with implications for nonlinear photonics and optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Rotating fluorescent nanodiamond assemblies with focused Laguerre-Gaussian beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers which utilize structured light fields enable the rotation of trapped nanoparticles through the transfer of orbital angular momentum (OAM) from holographically generated Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes. In this research we use OAM transfer to demonstrate controlled rotation of bright fluorescent nanodiamond clusters assembled in a focused higher-order LG beam. We find that the assemblies can be effectively rotated in a two-dimensional optical trap with orbital frequencies of up to 5 Hz. We use video tracking to explore the Brownian dynamics of such a trapping arrangement and look at the impact of orientation stability on measurements of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with an applied weak external magnetic field. By collecting ODMR spectra at multiple points along the orbit, we show that the constrained two-dimensional motion can provide additional insights for vector magnetic field reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Ultralow radiative heat flux by Anderson localization in quasiperiodic plasmonic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anderson localization, arising from wave interference in disordered systems, profoundly hinders energy transport, yet its impact on radiative heat flux in many-body thermophotonic systems remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a three-order-of-magnitude suppression of radiative heat transfer, resulting in ultralow radiative heat transfer, in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic chain of plasmonic nanoparticles. This suppression in radiative heat transfer is directly correlated with mode localization, as revealed by the mode decomposition of the transmission coefficient, which serves as evidence of Anderson localization. Furthermore, we elucidate the dependence of radiative thermal conductance reduction on interparticle spacing and material damping rates, uncovering the interplay between intrinsic Ohmic losses, mode localization, and long-range many-body interactions. Our findings advance the understanding of wave-mediated thermal transport in disordered photonic structures and suggest strategies for tailoring nanoscale heat management via engineered disorder.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Spin Meron Lattices with Height-Sensitive Topology Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate height-controlled topological switching of plasmonic spin meron lattices above a metallic square coupling structure under circularly polarized illumination. Near the interface, an evanescent surface plasmon polariton (SPP) channel yields a N\'eel-type meron lattice with $\pm\frac{1}{2}$ like effective site charges. At larger heights, diffracted fields from the square edges dominate and convert the lattice into a Bloch-type configuration. Over a range of intermediate heights, crossover between the evanescent SPP and edge diffraction gives rise to rich rapid topology evolutions. The switching is accompanied by nucleation of off-boundary vortex-anti vortex pairs in the in-plane spin phase, producing height-dependent fractional site charges. Our findings are analytically formulated by linear superposition of SPPs in the plasmonic regime and Stratton-Chu model in diffraction regime and confirmed via full-wave finite-difference time-domain simulations.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Tunable Infrared Metasurface Absorbers via a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrowband perfect absorbers are interesting for spectrum sensing, molecular detection, and infrared imaging. However, their design remains constrained by intuitive, iterative methods that lack flexibility, while also facing challenges in multi-objective optimization. Here, we introduce a deep learning-enabled inverse-design framework that overcomes these limitations through a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The main contribution of this work is a dual-channel image encoding scheme that jointly represents the geometry and thickness of a Si$_3$N$_4$ meta-layer, facilitating the network to learn the distribution of viable structures for a target optical response. This approach naturally solves the inherent ``one-to-many'' design issue, giving a diverse portfolio of functional candidates from a single input spectrum. The designed absorbers achieve exceptional spectral fidelity, with resonance peak errors below 5 nm, a mean squared error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, and the capacity to produce over 10 distinct, high-performance designs per target. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's robustness under oblique illumination, showing that it can be efficiently fine-tuned to maintain spectral accuracy across incidence angles from $10^\circ$ to $40^\circ$ by transfer learning, thus extending its practical utility to non-normal operating conditions. Full-wave simulations confirm that the generated geometries support a hybrid plasmonic-dielectric resonance, leading to near-perfect absorption and strong near-field enhancement. Our study provides a robust, physics-aware design paradigm that moves beyond conventional parametric optimization. The introduced framework establishes a versatile platform for the on-demand inverse design of advanced photonic devices for sensing, spectroscopy, and optical signal processing.</description>

      <title>Opposite amplitude phase entropy responses at a non Hermitian avoided crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Avoided crossings (A.C.) in open resonators arise from non-Hermitian mode interaction, where leakage produces complex spectra and biorthogonal eigenmodes. Intensity-based entropies are robust markers of mode mixing but discard the phase structure of the complex field. Here we introduce a field-level information-theoretic analysis based on the joint statistics of local amplitude and phase under Born-weighted sampling on the cavity grid. For an open elliptical microcavity in the strong-interaction A.C. regime, we find a distinctive sector-resolved response: amplitude statistics tighten while phase statistics broaden maximally at the mixing point, and conditioning reveals strong amplitude-phase dependence. By introducing a coarse position label and the associated co-information, we further show that the enhancement of global amplitude-phase coupling is strongly shaped by spatial heterogeneity across the cavity.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically DRC-Compliant Nanophotonic Design via Learned Generative Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design has enabled the systematic design of ultra-compact and high-performance nanophotonic components. Yet enforcing foundry design rules during inverse design remains a major challenge, as optimized devices frequently violate constraints on minimum feature size and spacing. Existing fabrication-constrained approaches typically rely on penalty terms, projection filters, or heuristic binarization schedules, which restrict the accessible design space, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and often fail to guarantee compliance throughout the optimization trajectory. Here, we introduce a framework for nanophotonic inverse design with intrinsic enforcement of design rules through a generative reparameterization of the design space, restricting optimization to a learned manifold of DRC-compliant geometries. We validate this paradigm by designing representative silicon photonic components including broadband power splitters, spectral duplexers, and mode converters operating across the 1,500-1,600 nm band for both electron-beam lithography and photolithography platforms. Across all devices, the manifold-based formulation reaches state-of-the-art performance metrics with over a 5-fold reduction in computational cost compared to pixel-based representations, while ensuring fabrication-compatible geometries throughout the entire design process. By treating fabrication constraints as a fundamental property of the design representation rather than an external penalty, this work establishes a direct pathway toward broadly applicable, platform-agnostic, and intrinsically DRC-compliant nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy and Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) are complementary, non-destructive techniques that provide rich and distinct insights into the structural and electronic properties of materials. Raman spectroscopy offers detailed information on vibrational modes, phase transitions, temperature, and local stress, while SHG is highly sensitive to symmetry and orientation, particularly in non-centrosymmetric structures. In this work, in addition to combining both techniques, we propose a novel approach to determine the nonlinear optical tensor, leveraging the spatial and ultra-fast temporal offset of a Bessel-Gaussian laser beam at the microscope's focal point.</description>

      <title>Quantum Trajectory Separation and Attosecond Mapping in Liquid High-Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) from liquids offers a potential pathway to attosecond spectroscopy in chemically complex and disordered environments, yet fundamental questions remain open: whether liquid harmonic emission preserves well-defined attosecond synchronization, and whether harmonic emission can involve simultaneous contributions from multiple quantum trajectories with distinct excursion times despite strong disorder and scattering. Here, we address these issues experimentally by resolving the trajectory-dependent temporal structure of liquid HHG. By optimizing the laser focusing geometry, we achieve clear spatial discrimination of short- and long-trajectory contributions, providing direct evidence for the existence of multiple quantum trajectories in liquids. Using a phase-controlled two-color driving field, we independently retrieve the attochirp associated with each trajectory and demonstrate opposite energy-time correlations for short and long trajectories, establishing a trajectory-resolved energy-time mapping in liquid HHG. All observations are well reproduced by semiclassical recollision simulations. These results place liquid HHG on the same conceptual footing as gas- and solid-phase HHG and establish a robust foundation for attosecond-resolved spectroscopy of ultrafast electronic and chemical dynamics in liquid environments.</description>

      <title>Generalized Time-Varying Drude Model for Dispersive and Lossy Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generalization of the time-varying Drude model, treating carrier density, effective mass, and collision rate as explicit functions of time. We derive expressions for polarization, susceptibility, displacement, and permittivity in different domains. Our analysis reveals that non-adiabatic modulations and time-dependent losses induce rich and distinct behaviors, leading to temporal blurring, selective gating and suppression, and low-frequency spectral reshaping. Besides underpinning and upgrading the current framework on photonics of time-varying media, this model may be useful in the design and fitting theoretical models with experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Pushing and Pulling Ponderomotive Forces in Wavepackets and Beat Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider ponderomotive forces acting on small particles in propagating wave packets (pulses). Specifically, we analyze simple point particles as well as composite dipole and dumbbell particles in the fields of forward-propagating (parallel phase and group velocities) and backward-propagating (antiparallel phase and group velocities) wave packets. Depending on the characteristics of the wave packet, particles may be pushed away from the wave source or pulled toward it. We also examine particle dynamics in the field of a beat wave generated by two forward-propagating waves with slightly different frequencies. Such a beat wave can emulate a periodic sequence of either forward- or backward-propagating pulses. In particular, this provides a simple mechanism for realizing pulling forces as employed in optical and acoustic `tractor beams'.</description>

      <title>Synthetic topological device for advancing elastic energy harvesting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-efficiency energy harvesting of ultrasonic elastic waves are crucial for powering electric gadgets in many emerging technologies such as wearable devices, wireless sensing, and biomedical implants. Although topological phononic metamaterials have recently been demonstrated as a promising paradigm for confining and guiding elastic waves through robust bound states, achieving ultrahigh-Q topological resonance with enhanced energy conversion efficiency remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a synthetic-dimensional higher-order topological insulator by engineering the flexural bands of elastic metamaterials, featuring highly localized topological hinge states in the bulk bands. This topological hinge mode stems from the nonzero combination of the bulk polarization and the Chern number in the synthetic-dimensional band structure, thus giving rise to a strong elastic-to-electric energy conversion at the corner of the phononic plate. Through numerical simulations and experimental validations, straightforward evidence of the localized modes with robust protection and consequent abilities in activating the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) array have been demonstrated. Our findings open a new avenue for topological-physics-enabled ultrasonic devices and present promising prospects for applications in weak-signal detection and self-powered sensors.</description>

      <title>Energy Transport Velocity in Photonic Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steep or near-vertical Floquet dispersion in photonic time crystals (PTCs) is often read as fast, even apparently superluminal, transport. Here, we demonstrate that this anomaly arises from modulation-driven geometric drift, not energy flow. By deriving a Maxwell-flux Hellmann-Feynman relation, we prove that the cycle-averaged energy velocity remains strictly bounded. We further establish a universal velocity-product law conserved throughout the passband, $ v_E v_g=\langle v_{\rm ph}^2\rangle_T $, fixing transport solely by the temporal average of the inverse permittivity. The divergent group velocity is then traced to a mismatch between electric and magnetic geometric phase connections, revealing apparent superluminality as a geometric effect of temporal modulation.</description>

      <title>Universal reconstructive polarimetry with graphene-metal infrared photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of light polarization has long been based on complex, bulk, and slow optical instruments. The advent of materials with in-situ variable polarization photoresponse has led to the concept of reconstructive polarimetry, where the detector itself plays the role of tunable polarizer. Materials enabling such functionality have been limited to complex van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate the reconstructive polarimetry with infrared (IR) detectors based on simple gated graphene-metal junctions. The reconstruction exploits the gate tuning of polarization contrast, which enables the evaluation of both infrared power and polarization angle from photovoltage measurements at two sequential gate voltages. The physics enabling the polarimetry lies in polarization-dependent shift of the electron hot spot near the contact, and the gate tuning of the of light-sensitive barrier width. We further show the universality of polarization reconstruction, i.e. its feasibility with different geometries of the junction, and with graphene of different quality, from hBN-encapsulated to the scalable vapor-deposited wet-transferred samples.</description>

      <title>Single-Emitter Spectra from an Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneity in nanoscale emitters hinders efforts to understand their basic photophysics and limits their use in practical applications. Existing methods have difficulty accurately characterizing single-emitter spectra and optical heterogeneity on a statistical scale. Here, we introduce SPICEE (SPectrally Imbalanced Correlations from Ensemble Emission), a spectrally filtered photon-correlation technique that recovers single-particle emission lineshapes from an ensemble sample. Analytical derivations, numerical modeling, and experiments on a solution ensemble of emitters validate the technique. We apply SPICEE to blue-emitting ZnSeTe semiconductor nanocrystals relevant to display applications and find that the low color purity in the ensemble spectrum is primarily caused by a small subpopulation of nanocrystals with a distinct emission mechanism. This work demonstrates that SPICEE is a powerful high-throughput tool for accurately characterizing the single-emitter properties of nanoscale systems.</description>

      <title>A thin and soft optical tactile sensor for highly sensitive object perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial in robotics and wearable devices for safe perception and interaction with the environment. Optical tactile sensors have emerged as promising solutions, as they are immune to electromagnetic interference and have high spatial resolution. However, existing optical approaches, particularly vision-based tactile sensors, rely on complex optical assemblies that involve lenses and cameras, resulting in bulky, rigid, and alignment-sensitive designs. In this study, we present a thin, compact, and soft optical tactile sensor featuring an alignment-free configuration. The soft optical sensor operates by capturing deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns generated within a soft silicone material, thereby enabling precise force measurements and texture recognition via machine learning. The experimental results show a root-mean-square error of 40 mN in the force measurement and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine classes of textured surfaces, including Mahjong tiles. The proposed speckle-based approach provides a compact, easily fabricated, and mechanically compliant platform that bridges optical sensing with flexible shape-adaptive architectures, thereby demonstrating its potential as a novel tactile-sensing paradigm for soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Learning of the Wave Speed Landscape in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave velocity is a key parameter for imaging complex media, but in vivo measurements are typically limited to reflection geometries, where only backscattered waves from short-scale heterogeneities are accessible. As a result, conventional reflection imaging fails to recover large-scale variations of the wave velocity landscape. Here we show that matrix imaging overcomes this limitation by exploiting the quality of wave focusing as an intrinsic guide star. We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution. We validate this approach through ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms and human breast tissues, demonstrating its potential for tumour detection and characterization. Our method is broadly applicable to any kind of waves and media for which a reflection matrix can be measured.</description>

      <title>Reducing acquisition time and radiation damage: data-driven subsampling for spectro-microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectro-microscopy is an experimental technique which can be used to observe spatial variations in chemical state and changes in chemical state over time or under experimental conditions. As a result it has broad applications across areas such as energy materials, catalysis, environmental science and biological samples. However, the technique is often limited by factors such as long acquisition times and radiation damage. We present two measurement strategies that allow for significantly shorter experiment times and total doses applied. The strategies are based on taking only a small subset of all the measurements (e.g. sparse acquisition or subsampling), and then computationally reconstructing all unobserved measurements using mathematical techniques. The methods are data-driven, using spectral and spatial importance subsampling distributions to identify important measurements. As a result, taking as little as 4-6\% of the measurements is sufficient to capture the same information as in a conventional scan.</description>

      <title>Star Grazing with Alumina Grass: Antireflection coatings in the visible and near-infrared on IPX-Clear Microlenses assisted by Grass-like Alumina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon polymerization (2PP) enables fabrication of high-precision micro-optics with complex freeform geometries, opening a new parameter space for custom astronomical optics. Among available resins, the newly developed IPX Clear is particularly well suited for visible applications, offering high transmission across the visible-near-IR, low surface roughness, and excellent shape fidelity. However, Fresnel reflections at the air-polymer interface introduce significant optical losses, which are detrimental in low-signal astronomy. Previous studies show grass-like alumina coatings on glass and fused silica can raise average transmission from 91.9% to approximately 99% over 400-900 nm. Here we explore the feasibility of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to apply such coatings to IPX-Clear micro-optics over 400-1700 nm. Grass-like alumina anti-reflective (AR) coatings can approximate the ideal index condition by creating a gradual refractive-index transition from air to bulk IPX Clear, suppressing surface reflections. While grass-like coatings are established on bulk optics and conformal ALD films have been applied to 2PP micro-optics, we demonstrate - for the first time - alumina grass on 2PP microlenses made with the new IPX-Clear resin. We discuss key challenges and process steps, and observe that alumina-grass-coated microlenses lose only approximately 0.3% of photons to reflection in the 400-850 nm range. Future work will test performance across the full 400-1700 nm band and explore improved environmental resilience, e.g., a SiO2 overcoat. Combined with the high optical transparency of IPX Clear, these coatings enable custom-designed, highly efficient microlenses for astronomical applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal displacement detection of arbitrarily-shaped levitated dielectric objects using optical radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically-levitated dielectric objects are promising for precision force, acceleration, torque, and rotation sensing due to their extreme environmental decoupling. While many levitated opto-mechanics experiments employ spherical objects, for some applications non-spherical geometries offer advantages. For example, rod-shaped or dumbbell shaped particles have been demonstrated for torque and rotation sensing and high aspect ratio plate-like particles can exhibit reduced photon recoil heating and may be useful for high-frequency gravitational wave detection or as high bandwidth accelerometers. To achieve optimal sensitivity, cooling, and quantum control in these systems, it is beneficial to achieve optimal displacement detection using scattered light. We describe and numerically implement a method based on Fisher information that is applicable to suspended particles of arbitrary geometry. We demonstrate the agreement between our method and prior methods employed for spherical particles, both in the Rayleigh and Lorentz-Mie regimes. As practical examples we analyze the optical detection limits of an optically-levitated high-aspect-ratio disc-like dielectric object and a rod-shaped object for configurations recently realized in experimental work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffraction tomography (DT) has been widely explored in transmission-mode configurations, enabling high-resolution, label-free 3D imaging. However, industrial metrology applications, such as semiconductor inspection, typically involve opaque or highly reflective substrates (e.g., silicon or metal), necessitating a reflection-mode imaging configuration. In this work, we introduce reflection-mode Multi-Slice Fourier Ptychographic Tomography (rMS-FPT) that achieves high-resolution, volumetric imaging of multi-layered, strongly scattering samples on reflective substrates. We develop a reflection-mode multi-slice beam propagation method (rMSBP) to model multiple scattering and substrate interactions, enabling precise 3D reconstruction. By incorporating darkfield measurements, rMS-FPT enhances resolution beyond the traditional brightfield limit and provides sub-micrometer lateral resolution while achieving optical sectioning. We validate rMS-FPT through numerical simulations on a four-layer resolution target and experimental demonstrations using a reflection-mode LED array microscope. Experiments on a two-layer resolution target and a multi-layer scattering sample confirm the method's effectiveness. Our optimized implementation enables rapid imaging, covering a 1.2 mm $\times$ 1.2 mm area in 1.6 seconds, reconstructing over $10^9$ voxels within a 0.4 mm$^3$ volume. This work represents a significant step in extending DT to reflection-mode configurations, providing a robust and scalable solution for 3D metrology and industrial inspection.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Reconstruction for Fractional Lateral Shear Measurements using Weighted Integer Shear Averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wavefront reconstruction in lateral shearing interferometry typically assumes that the shear amount is an integer multiple of the sampling interval. When the shear is fractional, approximating it with the nearest integer value leads to noticeable reconstruction errors. To address this, we propose a weighted integer shear averaging method. The approach combines reconstructions from nearby integer shears with carefully chosen weights designed to cancel the dominant error terms. Analytical error analysis shows that two-shear averaging removes first-order errors, while three-shear averaging removes second-order errors. Numerical simulations with a test wavefront confirm that the method achieves significantly lower RMS error than conventional single-shear reconstruction. The technique is simple, computationally efficient, and can be readily extended to two-dimensional interferometry. This makes weighted integer shear averaging a practical and accurate tool for wavefront reconstruction when fractional shear is unavoidable.</description>

Abstract: We report the development of a new instrument for cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy of the fundamental rovibrational transitions of molecules in the long-wave mid-infrared (LWIR) region from 6500 to 10000 nm. Our setup combines a LWIR frequency comb, a high-finesse optical enhancement cavity, a cryogenic buffer gas cooling cell, and a Fourier transform interferometer to obtain broadband, high-resolution, and high-sensitivity molecular absorption spectra. Here, we showcase the capabilities of this setup by presenting the gas-phase LWIR spectra of the $\nu_6$ band of ethane and the $\nu_{10}$ band of the gauche conformer of ethanol near 7200 nm under both room temperature and cryogenic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational optical tweezers are used to probe the mechanical properties of unknown microsystems. Quantifying the angular trap stiffness is essential for interpreting the rotational dynamics of probe particles. While methods to determine trap stiffness are well established for translational degrees of freedom, angular trapping is often treated analogously even though rotational and translational motions are sensitive to distinct experimental parameters and offer separate insights. This work details passive analysis techniques for determining the angular trap stiffness within the linear restoring torque model and examines the influence of several factors unique to rotational optical tweezers. We show that the parameters of an ancillary measurement beam can be tuned to minimise its influence on angular trapping dynamics, providing necessary improvements for nanoparticle-scale analysis. We also explore the combined effects of shape-induced and material birefringence in spheroidal vaterite probes, and present a framework for assessing hydrodynamic and inertial contributions.</description>

Abstract: Computer-generated hologram (CGH) allows for the on-demand scaling and projection of artificially designed target patterns, while incorporating benefits such as a lensless setup and high-frame-rate operation. In this work, we actively control the projection pattern using CGH and integrate two typical single-pixel imaging (SPI) schemes, thereby implementing a ghost imaging (GI) scheme with flexibly tunable properties. Specifically, various reference signals from computational holography and the corresponding bucket signals are used in the intensity correlation algorithm. Accordingly, those GI results enable the parallel presentation of the outcomes from these two SPI schemes. In the experiment, two types of target patterns, intensity-squared chaotic speckle and artificially designed sparse matrix, are used to perform GI. Those imaging results indicate a significant improvement in ghost image visibility, irrespective of whether the reference signal is the reconstruction or target pattern of computational holography. Furthermore, we realize positive and negative copies of ghost image via holographic projection in which symmetrical mirror target patterns are artificially designed. Thus, by integrating these two SPI schemes, the lensless GI scheme based on CGH not only advances towards the visibility requirements for practical applications but also enables a high-frame-rate projection scheme essential for multi-frame intensity correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Phase Prediction in Digital Lasers Using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital lasers control the laser beam by dynamically updating the phase patterns of the spatial light modulator (SLM) within the laser cavity. Due to the presence of nonlinear effects, such as mode competition and gain saturation in digital laser systems, it is often necessary to rely on specifically manually tailored approach or iteration processes to find suitable loaded phases in Digital lasers. This study proposes a model based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) and a modified U-Net architecture, with designed loss functions to inverse design the loaded phases. In this work, we employ deep neural networks to learn the nonlinear effects in simulated L-shape digital lasers, enabling the prediction of SLM-loaded phases for both analytical and non-analytical arbitrary structured light fields. The results demonstrate superior performance on non-analytical light fields compared to the current methods in L-shape Digital lasers. Furthermore, a transfer learning strategy is introduced, allowing knowledge obtained from one class of structured beams to be effectively reused for another, thereby enhancing generalization and improving performance under limited training data. Importantly, this method, the first proposed learning framework for digital lasers, is not limited to the L-shaped digital lasers discussed in this study, providing an efficient alternative for generating structured light in other digital laser systems.</description>

      <title>Electrical detection of high-order optical orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light provides an unbounded set of orthogonal modes for ultrahigh-capacity optical information processing. However, current OAM detection schemes typically rely on light interference or diffraction, which require bulky optical components and pose a major obstacle to on-chip integration. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated silicon-based photodetector that enables direct electrical detection of light OAM. This photodetector can resolve vortex beams with topological charges from m = -9 to 9, achieving a record-high mode number resolution among on-chip devices. By integrating plasmonic gratings onto the device electrodes, incident vortex beams can be converted into surface plasmon polaritons with OAM-dependent splitting angles, which in turn produce photocurrents that vary monotonically with the OAM order. Further incorporation of a surface dielectric lens can enhance mode resolution, and a split-electrode architecture enables OAM chirality discrimination. Owing to its CMOS-compatibility and spectral scalability, this platform provides a compact and robust solution for integrated OAM detection, opening new opportunities for on-chip optical communication and computing systems based on structured light.</description>

      <title>Efficient and tunable narrowband second-harmonic generation by a large-area etchless lithium niobate metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical resonances in nanostructures enable strong enhancement of nonlinear processes at the nanoscale, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), with high-$Q$ modes providing intensified light--matter interactions and sharp spectral selectivity for applications in filtering, sensing, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Thanks to the recent advances in thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology, these key features can be now translated to lithium niobate for realizing novel nanoscale nonlinear optical platforms. Here, we demonstrate a large-area metasurface, realized by scalable nanoimprint lithography, comprising a slanted titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$) nanograting on etchless TFLN for efficient narrowband SHG. This is enabled by the optimal coupling of quasi-bound state in the continuum (q-BIC) modes with a narrowband pulsed laser pump. The demonstrated normalized SHG efficiency is $0.15\%\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{GW}$, which is among the largest reported for LN metasurfaces. The low pump peak intensity ($3.64~\mathrm{kW}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) employed, which enables SHG even by continuous-wave pumping, allows envisioning integrated and portable photonic applications. SHG wavelength tuning from $870$ to $920~\mathrm{nm}$ with stable output power as well as polarization control is also achieved by off-normal pump illumination. This versatile platform opens new opportunities for sensing, THz generation and detection, and ultrafast electro-optic modulation of nonlinear optical signals.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Far-Field Quantum Coherence by Dielectric Bodies Based on the Volume Integral Equation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect is a hallmark of nonclassical two-photon interference. This paper develops a unified theory-numerics framework to compute angle-resolved far-field two-photon correlations from arbitrary lossless dielectric scatterers. We describe the input-output relation using a multi-channel scattering formulation that maps two populated incident channels to two selected far-field detection modes, yielding a compact two-channel transfer relation for second-order correlation function and time-domain coincidence counts. The required transfer coefficients are extracted from classical far-field complex amplitudes computed by an fast Fourier transform-accelerated volume integral equation solver, avoiding perfectly matched layers and near-to-far-field post-processing. The method is validated against analytical results for dielectric spheres and demonstrated on a polarization-converting Pancharatnam-Berry-phase metasurface, revealing strong angular dependence of quantum interference and its direct impact on HOM-dip visibility. The framework provides an efficient and physically transparent tool for structure-dependent quantum-correlation analysis, with potential applications in scatterers-enabled quantum state engineering and quantum inverse design.</description>

      <title>Implementation of transformer-based LLMs with large-scale optoelectronic neurons on a CMOS compatible platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only 40 nm CMOS process node, orchestrated by an optoelectronic version of systolic array with no data skew and negligible propagation delay, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm2. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that charge teleportation serves as a superior observable for Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET)-based cryptographic primitives. While following the LOCC protocol structure of earlier proposals, we show that decoding key bits via local charge rather than energy provides exact bit symmetry and enhanced robustness: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>
