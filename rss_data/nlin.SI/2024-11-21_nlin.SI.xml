      <title>Solutions to the constant Yang-Baxter equation: additive charge conservation in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find all solutions to the constant Yang--Baxter equation $R_{12}R_{13}R_{23}=R_{23}R_{13}R_{12}$ in three dimensions, subject to an additive charge-conservation ansatz. This ansatz is a generalisation of (strict) charge-conservation, for which a complete classification in all dimensions was recently obtained. Additive charge-conservation introduces additional sector-coupling parameters -- in 3 dimensions there are $4$ such parameters. In the generic dimension 3 case, in which all of the $4$ parameters are nonzero, we find there is a single 3 parameter family of solutions. We give a complete analysis of this solution, giving the structure of the centraliser (symmetry) algebra in all orders. We also solve the remaining cases with three, two, or one nonzero sector-coupling parameter(s).</description>

      <title>Symplectic mechanics of relativistic spinning compact bodies II.: Canonical formalism in the Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work constitutes the second part of a series of studies that aim to utilise tools from Hamiltonian mechanics to investigate the motion of an extended body in general relativity. The first part of this work [Refs. [1, 2]] constructed a ten-dimensional, covariant Hamiltonian framework encompassing all the linear-in-spin corrections to the geodesic motion in arbitrary spacetime. This framework was proven to be integrable in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, specifically. The present work translates this abstract integrability result into tangible applications for linear-in-spin Hamiltonian dynamics of a compact object in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In particular, a canonical system of coordinates is constructed explicitly, which exploits the spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild spacetime. These coordinates are based on a relativistic generalization of the classical Andoyer variables of Newtonian rigid body motion. This canonical setup allows us to derive ready-to-use formulae for action-angle coordinates and gauge-invariant Hamiltonian frequencies, which automatically include all linear-in-spin effects. No external parameters or ad hoc choices are necessary, and the framework can be used to find complete solutions by quadrature of generic (bound or unbound), linear-in-spin orbits, including orbital inclination, precession and eccentricity, as well as spin precession. The efficacy of the formalism is demonstrated here in the context of circular orbits with arbitrary spin and orbital precession, with the results validated against known results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade and Burgers turbulence in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of initial long-wavelength excitations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain has been the subject of intense investigations since the pioneering work of Fermi and collaborators. We have recently found a new regime where the spectrum of the Fourier modes decays with a power-law and we have interpreted this regime as a transient turbulence associated with the Burgers equation. In this paper we present the full derivation of the latter equation from the lattice dynamics using a newly developed infinite dimensional Hamiltonian perturbation theory. This theory allows us to relate the time evolution of the Fourier spectrum $E_k$ of the Burgers equation to the one of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain. As a consequence, we derive analytically both the shock time and the power-law $-8/3$ of the spectrum at this time. Using the shock time as a unit, we follow numerically the time-evolution of the spectrum and observe the persistence of the power $-2$ over an extensive time window. The exponent $-2$ has been widely discussed in the literature on the Burgers equation. The analysis of the Burgers equation in Fourier space also gives information on the time evolution of the energy of each single mode which, at short time, is also a power-law depending on the $k$-th wavenumber $E_k \sim t^{2k-2}$. This approach to the FPUT dynamics opens the way to a wider study of scaling regimes arising from more general initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry: Exact asymptotics in Rule 54</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry are two measures of quantum correlations sensitive to symmetries of the system. Here we discuss their non-equilibrium dynamics in the Rule 54 cellular automaton, a simple, yet interacting, integrable model. Both quantities can be expressed in terms of the more analytically tractable "charged moments", i.e. traces of powers of a suitably deformed density matrix, via a replica trick. We express them in terms of a tensor network, which we contract in space using a system of local algebraic relations. This gives the asymptotic form for the charged moments, valid in the regime of large but finite time that is shorter than all the relevant subsystem sizes. In this regime the charge moments decay exponentially with the rate given by the leading solution to a cubic equation.</description>
