      <title>Antimagic Labeling of Graphs Using Prime Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph labeling is a technique that assigns unique labels or weights to the vertices or edges of a graph, often used to analyze and solve various graph-related problems. There are few methods with certain limitations conducted by researchers previously on this topic. This research paper focuses on antimagic labeling of different types of graphs and trees. It entails the assignment of distinct prime values to edges in a manner that ensures the cumulative sum of edge labels at each vertex remains unique. This research proposes a conjecture on antimagic labeling of any graphs and proves two theories. Firstly, we tried to give weights to the edges randomly, as some exceptions are faced in particular phases in this way, we followed a whole new way to mitigate this problem. This research paper demonstrates computational and mathematical verification to prove that antimagic labeling of any perfect binary tree and complete graph is possible.</description>

      <title>On the Weighted Top-Difference Distance: Axioms, Aggregation, and Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of distance functions on rankings that allow for asymmetric treatments of alternatives and consider the distinct relevance of the top and bottom positions for ordered lists. We provide a full axiomatic characterization of our distance. In doing so, we retrieve new characterizations of existing axioms and show how to effectively weaken them for our purposes. This analysis highlights the generality of our distance as it embeds many (semi)metrics previously proposed in the literature. Subsequently, we show that, notwithstanding its level of generality, our distance is still readily applicable. We apply it to preference aggregation, studying the features of the associated median voting rule. It is shown how the derived preference function satisfies many desirable features in the context of voting rules, ranging from fairness to majority and Pareto-related properties. We show how to compute consensus rankings exactly, and provide generalized Diaconis-Graham inequalities that can be leveraged to obtain approximation algorithms. Finally, we propose some truncation ideas for our distances inspired by Lu and Boutilier (2010). These can be leveraged to devise a Polynomial-Time-Approximation Scheme for the corresponding rank aggregation problem.</description>

      <title>Flip-Breakability: A Combinatorial Dichotomy for Monadically Dependent Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A conjecture in algorithmic model theory predicts that the model-checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on a hereditary graph class if and only if the class is monadically dependent. Originating in model theory, this notion is defined in terms of logic, and encompasses nowhere dense classes, monadically stable classes, and classes of bounded twin-width. Working towards this conjecture, we provide the first two combinatorial characterizations of monadically dependent graph classes. This yields the following dichotomy.
  On the structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by a Ramsey-theoretic property called flip-breakability. This notion generalizes the notions of uniform quasi-wideness, flip-flatness, and bounded grid rank, which characterize nowhere denseness, monadic stability, and bounded twin-width, respectively, and played a key role in their respective model checking algorithms. Natural restrictions of flip-breakability additionally characterize bounded treewidth and cliquewidth and bounded treedepth and shrubdepth.
  On the non-structure side, we characterize monadic dependence by explicitly listing few families of forbidden induced subgraphs. This result is analogous to the characterization of nowhere denseness via forbidden subdivided cliques, and allows us to resolve one half of the motivating conjecture: First-order model checking is AW[$*$]-hard on every hereditary graph class that is monadically independent. The result moreover implies that hereditary graph classes which are small, have almost bounded twin-width, or have almost bounded flip-width, are monadically dependent.
  Lastly, we lift our result to also obtain a combinatorial dichotomy in the more general setting of monadically dependent classes of binary structures.</description>
