      <title>Exploring the properties of the Hadronic Phase in Heavy-Ion Collisions at RHIC Energies via Partial Chemical Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions plays a crucial role in shaping the final-state hadron abundances. In this work, we study Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7-200 GeV using the Hadron Resonance Gas model in Partial Chemical Equilibrium (HRG-PCE). By fitting the yields of stable hadrons and short-lived resonances such as K$^*(892)^0$, we extract both chemical and kinetic freeze-out temperatures as functions of center-of-mass energy and centrality. The analysis, performed using the Thermal-FIST package, avoids assumptions about radial flow profile or freeze-out hypersurfaces. Furthermore, we estimate the baryon annihilation freeze-out temperature from the experimentally measured $\bar{\rm p}/$p ratio, using the HRG-PCE framework extended to include $B\bar{B} \leftrightarrow n\pi$ reactions. The inferred annihilation freeze-out temperature lies between the chemical and kinetic freeze-out temperatures, suggesting that baryon annihilation remains active in the early hadronic phase but ceases prior to kinetic freeze-out. These results provide a consistent picture of the sequential decoupling of hadronic processes and demonstrate that inelastic hadronic interactions significantly influence the chemical composition of the system between chemical and kinetic freeze-outs at RHIC energies.</description>

      <title>Baryon Transition Form Factors from Dynamical Coupled-Channel Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, the electromagnetic transition form factors from the nucleon ground state to twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ states are exhibited and discussed. Those results are extracted through a comprehensive coupled-channel approach -- the Juelich-Bonn-Washington model, with the center-of-mass energy ranging from $1.13$ GeV to $1.8$ GeV, and the photon virtuality up to $8$ GeV$^2$. The extraction is based on $10^5$ electroproduction data points of $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ channels, with additionally about $5\times 10^4$ data points in the hadronic sector as well as photoproductions as boundary conditions. The form factors are defined from the residues at the corresponding resonance poles in the multipole amplitudes. Uncertainties are also estimated by the exploration of the parameter space. The qualitative behavior of the transition form factors of $N(1440)$ and $\Delta(1232)$ here are in agreement with the previous studies, while for the other states, there has not been literature results that are also defined at the resonance poles.</description>

      <title>From first to second minimum: Parity-dependent level densities in $^{240,242}$Pu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the parity-dependent level density ratios for $^{240,242}$Pu across a broad range of quadrupole deformations, from the spherical configuration up to the superdeformed region, explicitly including both the ground-state minimum and the second minimum (fission isomer). The parity-equilibration energy, defined as the excitation energy at which positive- and negative-parity level densities approach equilibrium, is compared between configurations. A significant reduction is observed near the second minimum, indicating a faster equilibration process in this region.</description>

      <title>Effects of the centrality determination method for the equation of state and nucleonic observables from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.4 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centrality determination remains one of the major sources of systematic uncertainty in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collision analyses, especially for probing the nuclear equation of state (EoS) at supra-saturation densities. To quantitatively assess the uncertainties associated with different centrality determination methods and to investigate their effects on final-state EoS-sensitive observables. Within the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model, Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.4 GeV are performed within a soft and a hard EoS. Event centrality is determined using the multiplicity of all charged particles ($M_\mathrm{ch}$) and two impact parameter-based centrality filters, one based on a geometrical interpretation and the other based on the Glauber Monte Carlo (MC) model, denoted as $b_{f}$ and $b_{r}$, respectively. It is shown that there exist significant differences between the real impact parameter distributions of event samples selected by $M_\mathrm{ch}$, $b_{f}$, and $b_{r}$, particularly between $M_\mathrm{ch}$ and $b_{r}$. When the $b_{f}$ is employed, uncertainties associated with centrality selection have a weaker influence on observables than the effects induced by the EoS. In contrast, when the $b_{r}$ is used, the influence of centrality-related uncertainties becomes more pronounced than that of the EoS. These results demonstrate that a rigorous and consistent mapping between $M_\mathrm{ch}$ and impact parameter is essential to impose quantitative constraints on the high-density nuclear EoS. Furthermore, our study indicates that the geometrical interpretation of centrality remains valid and consistent with dynamical multiplicity selection, whereas the Glauber MC-based centrality determination becomes unreliable at the investigated energy.</description>

      <title>De-excitation effects in multi-nucleon transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study quantifies the impact of nuclear de-excitation on correlations in multi-nucleon transfer (MNT) reactions. To bridge the gap between initial collision dynamics and final experimental observables, we introduce a hybrid TDCDFT+GEMINI approach, integrating time-dependent covariant density functional theory (TDCDFT) with the statistical de-excitation model GEMINI++. Applied to the $^{40}$Ca + $^{208}$Pb reaction, our method demonstrates that the de-excitation is essential for reconciling theoretical cross sections with experimental data. Analysis of the cross-section Shannon entropy reveals that new reaction channels open abruptly at a specific energy threshold. By employing mutual information, we show that the de-excitation process significantly degrades the initial quantum entanglement between the projectile-like and the target-like fragments, revealing a key mechanism through which fundamental quantum correlations are lost.</description>

      <title>The 2025 Evaluation of Experimental Thermonuclear Reaction Rates (ETR25)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work describes the formalism for estimating thermonuclear reaction rates for astrophysical applications, emphasizing modern statistical approaches such as Monte-Carlo sampling and Bayesian models. We discuss related topics including the calculation of resonance energies from nuclear Q values, indirect estimates of particle partial widths, and matching of reaction rates at elevated temperatures to statistical-model results. We have evaluated available experimental data on cross sections, resonance energies and strengths, partial widths, life-times, spin-parities, and spectroscopic factors. Based on these results, we have estimated numerical values of 78 experimental charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for target nuclei in the A = 2 to 40 mass region, for temperatures ranging from 1 MK to 10 GK. For each reaction, three rate values are provided: low, median, and high, corresponding to the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate probability density distribution. Additionally, we present the factor uncertainty of each rate at each temperature grid point. These results enable users to sample the reaction rate probability density in nucleosynthesis calculations, facilitating uncertainty estimates of nuclidic abundances. The rates presented here refer to their laboratory values. For use in stellar model simulations, these values need to be corrected for the effects of thermal excitations of the interacting nuclei. For each reaction, we include graphs that illustrate the fractional contributions to the overall reaction rate along with the associated uncertainty. These visuals are designed to assist both stellar modelers and nuclear experimentalists by identifying the primary sources of rate uncertainty at specific stellar temperatures. A graphical comparison with earlier Monte-Carlo rates is also provided.</description>

      <title>Gluon knots as the dynamical core of baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a conjectural picture of baryon structure in which gluon knots, a type of topologically nontrivial configuration of color--magnetic monopole condensates, forms the dynamical core of the baryon. Within this framework, quarks interact with the gluon knot via abelian-dominated color-electric fields, which are squeezed into flux tubes by the dual Meissner effect, leading naturally to quark confinement. The color--magnetic fields associated with the gluon knot also induce a local chiral condensate, contributing to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the baryon mass. Extending this conjecture to heavy-flavor mesons, we argue that stable flux tubes and gluon knots may also play a role in their internal structure, whereas light-flavor mesons are dominated by alternative confinement mechanisms. Our approach provides a unified, topologically motivated picture linking confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and the internal dynamics of baryons and certain mesons, suggesting that gluon knots constitute fundamental infrared degrees of freedom of Yang--Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Bjorken Initial Energy Density and Viscous Longitudinal Hydrodynamic Evolution in Xe-Xe Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the Bjorken initial energy density in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.44$ TeV, estimated using charged-particle multiplicity data and a generalized transverse overlap geometry applicable beyond the most central collisions. The dependence of the extracted energy density is examined by adopting both a constant formation time and a centrality-dependent formation time derived from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Corresponding Bjorken energy density estimates for Pb-Pb collisions are also presented for comparison. Taking the Bjorken energy density and formation time as initial conditions, the subsequent longitudinal evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in these collisions is studied. Both ideal and first-order viscous boost-invariant hydrodynamics are employed to assess the influence of dissipation. We observe that viscous effects slow the longitudinal expansion and lead to entropy production dominated by early-time dynamics. The lifetime of the QGP is observed to increase with centrality and is substantially enhanced by viscous effects. These effects are highly sensitive to the choice of formation time, particularly in peripheral collisions. A comparative analysis of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions demonstrates that the longitudinal evolution is primarily controlled by the initial energy density scale set by the Bjorken prescription. Consequently, when this scale is comparable, both systems exhibit nearly identical evolution patterns, while appreciable distinctions emerge in peripheral collisions due to system-size and geometric effects.</description>

      <title>Exact Neutron-Proton Wavefunctions Using the Phase Function Method</title>

Abstract: Radial phase shifts ($\delta(r)$), amplitude functions ($A(r)$), and exact wavefunctions ($u(r)$) for various uncoupled S, P, and D channels of neutron--proton scattering have been calculated using the Phase Function Method (PFM). In these calculations, inverse potentials obtained from the Morse function as the zeroth-order reference potential are employed. The parameters of the Morse potential were optimized using the comprehensive GRANADA partial wave analysis, consisting of 6713 experimental \textit{np} phase shift data points from 1950 to 2013, by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) as a cost function. The present work provides detailed radial dependence of $\delta(r)$, $A(r)$, and $u(r)$ up to 5~fm for laboratory energies $E_{\ell \text{lab}} = [1, 10, 50, 100, 150, 250, 350]$~MeV. The obtained wavefunctions show excellent agreement with high-precision Nijmegen-II results, highlighting the accuracy and transparency of the PFM approach for uncoupled scattering states.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of angular momentum distributions across the full range of fission fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern nuclear theory provides qualitative insights into the fundamental mechanisms of nuclear fission and is increasingly capable of making reliable quantitative predictions. Most quantities of interest pertain to the primary fission fragments, whose subsequent decay is typically modeled using statistical reaction models. Consequently, a key objective of fission theory is to inform these models by predicting the initial conditions of the primary fragments. In this work, we employ a framework that combines joint angular momentum and particle number projection with time-dependent configuration mixing to calculate the angular momentum distributions of primary fragments. Focusing on the benchmark cases of neutron-induced fission of $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu, we predict - for the first time - microscopic angular momentum distributions for all fragments observed in experiments. Our results reveal a pronounced sawtooth pattern in the average angular momentum as a function of fragment mass, consistent with recent measurements. Additionally, we observe substantial variations in angular momentum distributions along isobaric chains, indicating that commonly used empirical formulas lack sufficient accuracy. We also quantify a strong correlation between the angular momentum and the deformation of the fragments at scission, and a weak correlation in the magnitude of the angular momentum between fragment partners. The generated data will enable estimation of the impact of microscopic distributions on fission spectra, paving the way toward fission modeling based on microscopic inputs.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of the low-energy enhancement in the gamma-decay strength of \(^{50}\)V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the microscopic origin of the low-energy enhancement (LEE) in \(^{50}\)V with large-scale shell-model calculations to obtain $E1$ and $M1$ transitions within the same theoretical framework. The valence space spans the three major shells $sd$, $pf$ and $sdg$ and is treated with the SDPFSDG-MU interaction using the KSHELL code. With a \(1 \hbar \omega\) truncation, 3600 energy eigenstates and a basis of $7.02\times10^{6}$ positive and $5.94\times10^{8}$ negative parity states, the calculations yield nearly two million individual dipole transitions. The fourteen lowest experimental levels are reproduced within $0.30$~MeV, the calculated total level density excellently reproduces Oslo-method data up to $E \approx 7.5$~MeV, and the calculated dipole gamma strength function follows the experimental shape -- including the LEE -- for the full gamma-energy range covered by the Oslo experiment. The LEE is shown to be entirely magnetic dipole in origin. Both spin and orbital parts of the \(\hat{M}1\) operator are required to reproduce the LEE, with constructive interference between the spin and orbital parts giving an extra enhancement to the LEE. Reduced one-body transition densities identify $0f_{7/2} \rightarrow 0f_{7/2}$ proton transitions as the principal driver of the LEE.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations and Stability of Neutron Stars with Antikaon Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radial oscillations provide a direct probe of the stability and compressibility of neutron stars and are highly sensitive to the equation of state of dense matter. In this work, we investigate the impact of antikaon condensates on the radial oscillation properties of neutron stars. We model neutron star matter using equations of state with a wide range of stiffness. For this purpose, both non-linear and density-dependent relativistic mean-field frameworks are employed to develop equations of state that are consistent with current astrophysical constraints. We further consider the emergence of antikaon condensates ($K^-$ and $\bar{K}^0$) in the stellar core, which modifies the pressure--energy density relation of dense matter. We find that the nature of the transition from nuclear matter to the condensed phase is sensitive to the antikaon optical potential depth and underlying equation of state. We compute the fundamental and higher-order radial oscillation modes for neutron stars containing antikaon condensates over a range of antikaon optical potential depths. Our results demonstrate that the antikaon optical potential depth plays a decisive role in governing the systematic shifts observed in the radial oscillation frequencies, while also significantly reducing the stability limits and maximum masses of neutron stars. These imprints of antikaon condensation on radial oscillation spectra provide a promising avenue for future multi-messenger observations and high-frequency gravitational-wave searches to directly probe and constrain the internal composition and equation of state of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of a light fermion bound to a heavy one is expected to be described by the Dirac equation with an external potential. The potential breaks translation invariance, whereas the bound state momentum is well defined. Boosting the bound state determines the frame dependence of the light fermion dynamics. I study the Dirac limit of QCD$_2$ in the limit of $N_c \to \infty$. The light quark wave function turns out to be independent of the frame of the bound state, up to an irrelevant Lorentz contraction. The discrete bound state spectrum determines corresponding discrete energies of the Dirac equation, which for a linear potential allows a continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Study of transition form factors of the lightest pseudoscalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the transition form factors of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons, $\pi^0$, $\eta$, and $\eta'$, within the framework of resonance chiral theory. Our analysis is performed based on the data of time-like and space-like singly-virtual and space-like doubly-virtual form factors, as well as the relevant cross sections and latest invariant mass spectra of $e^+e^-$ pair for the process of $P\to\gamma e^+ e^-$. The transition form factors of these pseudoscalars are obtained. Also, we evaluate their contributions to the light-by-light part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Our two Fits give similar results, where Fit-A gives $a_\mu^{\pi^0 }=(61.6\pm 1.8)\times10^{-11}$, $a_\mu^{\eta }=(15.2\pm1.7)\times10^{-11}$, $a_\mu^{\eta'}=(16.0\pm 1.2)\times10^{-11}$, and the total contribution of neutral pseudo-scalar meson poles is $a_\mu^{\pi^0+\eta+\eta'}=(92.8\pm2.9)\times10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the $\nu i$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.</description>

      <title>Rapidly rotating hot nuclear and hypernuclear compact stars: integral parameters and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties. We consider both nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy slopes, fixed entropies per baryon $s / k_B=1$ and 3, and electron fractions $Y_e=0.1$ and $Y_e=0.4$, representative of conditions in binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars. We compute and analyze mass--radius and moment--of--inertia--mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian (mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron fraction.</description>

      <title>$QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ Quark System and Gauge/String Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that, depending on the geometry and quark ordering, the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system may be a hadronic molecule, a tetraquark state, or a superposition of the two. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering model predictions against a missing energy profile obtained using a monoenergetic neutrino beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14831v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</description>
