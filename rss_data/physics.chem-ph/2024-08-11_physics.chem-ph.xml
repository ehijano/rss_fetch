      <title>Scalable learning of potentials to predict time-dependent Hartree-Fock dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework to learn the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) inter-electronic potential of a molecule from its electron density dynamics. Though the entire TDHF Hamiltonian, including the inter-electronic potential, can be computed from first principles, we use this problem as a testbed to develop strategies that can be applied to learn \emph{a priori} unknown terms that arise in other methods/approaches to quantum dynamics, e.g., emerging problems such as learning exchange-correlation potentials for time-dependent density functional theory. We develop, train, and test three models of the TDHF inter-electronic potential, each parameterized by a four-index tensor of size up to $60 \times 60 \times 60 \times 60$. Two of the models preserve Hermitian symmetry, while one model preserves an eight-fold permutation symmetry that implies Hermitian symmetry. Across seven different molecular systems, we find that accounting for the deeper eight-fold symmetry leads to the best-performing model across three metrics: training efficiency, test set predictive power, and direct comparison of true and learned inter-electronic potentials. All three models, when trained on ensembles of field-free trajectories, generate accurate electron dynamics predictions even in a field-on regime that lies outside the training set. To enable our models to scale to large molecular systems, we derive expressions for Jacobian-vector products that enable iterative, matrix-free training.</description>

      <title>A High-Temperature Thermocouple Development by Additive Manufacturing: Tungsten-Nickel (W-Ni) and Molybdenum (Mo) Integration with Ceramic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing holds more potential to enable the development of ceramic-based components. Ceramics offer high resistance to heat, high fracture toughness, and are extremely corrosion resistant. Thus, ceramics are widely used in sectors such as the aerospace industry, automotive, microelectronics, and biomedicine. Using various additive manufacturing platforms, ceramics with complex and uniquely designed geometry can be developed to suit specific applications. This project aims at innovating high-temperature thermocouples by embedding conductive metal pastes into a ceramic structure. The paste used includes tungsten, molybdenum, and antimony. The metal pastes are precisely extruded into a T-shaped trench inside the ceramic matrix. Following specific temperature ranges, the ceramic matrix is sintered to improve the properties of the material. The sensors produced can function at extremely high temperatures and are thereby suitable for high-temperature environments. Comparative testing of the 3D sintered sensors with conventional temperature sensors shows high correlation between the two classes of sensors. The resulting R-squared value of 0.9885 is satisfactory which implies the reliability and accuracy of 3D sintering sensors are satisfactory in temperature sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Computations of Nearly Degenerate Singlet and Triplet states of N-heterocyclic Chromophores : II. Density-based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the performance of several density-based methods in predicting the inversion of S$_1$ and T$_1$ states of a few N-heterocyclic fused ring molecules (popularly known as INVEST molecules) with an eye to identify a well performing but cheap preliminary screening method. Both conventional LR-TDDFT and $\Delta$SCF methods (namely MOM, SGM, ROKS) are considered for excited state computations using exchange-correlation (XC) functionals from different rungs of the Jacob's ladder. A well-justified systematism is observed in the performance of the functionals when compared against FICMRCISD and/or EOM-CCSD, with the most important feature being the capture of spin-polarization in presence of correlation. A set of functionals with the least mean absolute error (MAE) is proposed for both the approaches, LR-TDDFT and $\Delta$SCF, which can be cheaper alternatives for computations on synthesizable larger derivatives of the templates studied here. We have based our findings on extensive studies of three cyclazine-based molecular templates, with additional studies on a set of six related templates. Previous benchmark studies for subsets of the functionals were conducted against the DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD, which resulted in an inadequate evaluation due to deficiencies in the benchmark theory. The role of exact-exchange, spin-contamination and spin-polarization in the context of DFT comes to the forefront in our studies and supports the numerical evaluation of XC functionals for these applications. Suitable connections are drawn to two and three state exciton models which identify the minimal physics governing the interactions in these molecules.</description>

      <title>Hybrid lunar ISRU plant: a comparative analysis with carbothermal reduction and water extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To establish a self-sustained human presence in space and to explore deeper into the solar system, extensive research has been conducted on In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems. Past studies have proposed and researched many technologies to produce oxygen from regolith, such as carbothermal reduction and water extraction from icy regolith, to utilize it for astronauts' life support and as the propellant of space systems. However, determining the most promising technology remains challenging due to uncertainties in the lunar environment and processing methods. To better understand the lunar environment and ISRU operations, it is crucial to gather more information. Motivated by this need for information gathering, this paper proposes a new ISRU plant architecture integrating carbothermal reduction of dry regolith and water extraction from icy regolith. Two different hybrid plant architectures integrating both technologies (1) in parallel and (2) in series are examined. The former involves mining and processing in both a Permanently Shadowed Region (PSR) and a peak of eternal light in parallel, while the latter solely mines in a PSR. In this series hybrid architecture, the dry regolith tailings from water extraction are further processed by carbothermal reduction. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of the landed mass and required power of each plant architecture utilizing subsystem-level models. Furthermore, based on uncertain parameters such as resource content in regolith, the potential performance range of each plant was discovered through Monte Carlo simulations. The result indicates the benefit of the series hybrid architecture in terms of regolith excavation rate, while its mass cost seems the highest among the studied architectures.</description>

      <title>When do molecular polaritons behave like optical filters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective outlines several linear optical effects featured by molecular polaritons arising in the collective strong light-matter coupling regime, focusing on the limit when the number of molecules per photon mode is large. We show that, under these circumstances, molecular absorption within a cavity can be understood as the overlap between the polariton transmission and bare molecular absorption spectra, suggesting that polaritons act in part as optical filters. This framework demystifies and provides a straightforward explanation for a large class of theoretical models of polaritonic phenomena, highlighting that similar effects might be achievable outside a cavity with shaped laser pulses. With a few modifications, this simple conceptual picture can also be adapted to understand the incoherent nonlinear response of polaritonic systems. However, we note that there are experimental observations in the collective regime that exhibit phenomena that go beyond this treatment. Our analysis underscores the importance of the notion that the field still needs to establish a clear distinction between polaritonic phenomena that can be fully explained through classical optics and those that require a more advanced theoretical framework. The linear optics approach presented here is exact when the number of molecules tends to infinity and is quite accurate for a large, but finite, number of molecules. We highlight the limitations of this treatment when the rates of the single-molecule processes that facilitate dark-state-to-polariton relaxation cannot be neglected and in systems under strong coupling with few molecules. Further exploration in these areas is needed to uncover novel polaritonic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hidden photoexcitations probed by multi-pulse photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoluminescence is a validated method for tracking the photoexcited carrier dynamics in luminescent materials. This technique probes the photoluminescence decays upon a periodic excitation by short laser pulses. Herein, we demonstrate that this approach cannot directly detect hidden photoexcitations with much slower dynamics than the photoluminescence decay. We demonstrate a new method based on a multi-pulse excitation scheme that enables an unambiguous detection and an easily interpreted tracking of these hidden species. The multi-pulse excitation consists of a single pulse (Read) followed by a burst of many closely separated pulses (Write) and finally another single pulse (Read). To illustrate the efficacy of the Read-Write-Read excitation scheme, we apply it to metal halide perovskites to directly visualize carrier trapping, extract the concentration of trapped charges and determine the rate constant of trap depopulation. The developed approach allows studying performance-limiting processes in energy devices using a versatile, highly applicable all-optical method.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The evolution of configurations is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>

      <title>CREMP: Conformer-rotamer ensembles of macrocyclic peptides for machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational and machine learning approaches to model the conformational landscape of macrocyclic peptides have the potential to enable rational design and optimization. However, accurate, fast, and scalable methods for modeling macrocycle geometries remain elusive. Recent deep learning approaches have significantly accelerated protein structure prediction and the generation of small-molecule conformational ensembles, yet similar progress has not been made for macrocyclic peptides due to their unique properties. Here, we introduce CREMP, a resource generated for the rapid development and evaluation of machine learning models for macrocyclic peptides. CREMP contains 36,198 unique macrocyclic peptides and their high-quality structural ensembles generated using the Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST). Altogether, this new dataset contains nearly 31.3 million unique macrocycle geometries, each annotated with energies derived from semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) DFT calculations. Additionally, we include 3,258 macrocycles with reported passive permeability data to couple conformational ensembles to experiment. We anticipate that this dataset will enable the development of machine learning models that can improve peptide design and optimization for novel therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio variational wave functions for the time-dependent many-electron Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing the real-time evolution of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for understanding the dynamical properties of condensed matter, molecular systems in quantum chemistry, and the behaviors of complex materials. However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. Our methodology introduces a parameterization of the time-evolving quantum state, enabling an accurate approximation of its evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which can be further enhanced by incorporating neural networks for function parameterization. We utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique to efficiently compute optimal time-dependent parameters. Additionally, we introduce a new time-evolution method based on Trotter-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics that are not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>
