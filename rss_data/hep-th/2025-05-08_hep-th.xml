      <title>The Computational Complexity of the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weak Gravity Conjecture imposes stringent constraints on effective field theories to allow for an ultraviolet completion within quantum gravity. While substantial evidence supports the conjecture across broad classes of string theory-derived effective field theories, constructing low-dimensional models realizing it explicitly remains highly non-trivial. In this work, we illustrate how the presence of multiple gauge fields in an effective field theory significantly complicates the bottom-up implementation of the Weak Gravity Conjecture. To this end, we introduce a general algorithm that constructs the convex hull associated with a given set of superextremal states and verifies whether it satisfies the Convex Hull version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture. We show that the computational time of this construction grows exponentially with the number of gauge fields, thereby revealing a fundamental obstruction to concrete, algorithmic realizations of the conjecture in theories with many gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Orthosymplectic Quivers: Indices, Hilbert Series, and Generalised Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate generalised global symmetries in 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ orthosymplectic quiver gauge theories. Using the superconformal index, we identify a $D_8$ categorical symmetry web in a class of theories featuring $\mathfrak{so}(2N) \times \mathfrak{usp}(2N)$ gauge algebra (at zero Chern-Simons levels) and $n$ bifundamental half-hypermultiplets, analogous to ABJ-type models. As a distinct contribution, we improve the prescription, previously studied in the literature, for computing Coulomb branch Hilbert series of $\mathrm{SO}(N)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ vector hypermultiplets. Our improved prescription extends these methods by incorporating fugacities for discrete zero-form symmetries - specifically charge conjugation and magnetic symmetries - and properly treating background magnetic fluxes for the flavour symmetry. This refinement enables calculations for various global forms ($\mathrm{O}(N)^\pm, \mathrm{Spin}(N), \mathrm{Pin}(N)$) and ensures consistency with the Coulomb branch limit of the superconformal index and known dualities. The proper treatment of fluxes is particularly essential for analysing orthosymplectic quivers where such a flavour symmetry is gauged. We verify our methods through several examples, including an analysis of the mapping of discrete symmetries under mirror symmetry for $T[\mathrm{SO}(N)]$ and $T[\mathrm{USp}(2N)]$ theories. The analysis also readily generalises to the $T_\rho[\mathrm{SO}(N)]$ and $T_\rho[\mathrm{USp}(2N)]$ theories associated with partition $\rho$.</description>

      <title>A new framework for classical double copies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double copy relates gauge and gravitational theories, with widespread application to quantum scattering amplitudes and classical perturbative results. It also connects exact classical solutions of abelian gauge and gravitational theories in a small number of specific examples, known as classical double copies. These have a number of special properties, such as being algebraically special. It remains an open question if classical doubles copies exist for algebraically general spacetimes, or those which possess nontrivial dynamics. Here we provide a novel framework for understanding classical double copies at the level of the metric, both organizing the known examples and exploring their properties under a new lens. Utilizing Killing vectors as natural gauge fields on a spacetime, we propose a procedure for generating new classical double copies. As a proof of concept, we provide a flat space single copy for the Kasner metric, an algebraically general spacetime. This example is also a double copy at the level of its curvature, and provides the first type I Weyl double copy, confirming expectations from perturbation theory. This provides a promising avenue for extending exact double copies to a broader class of general, physically relevant spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Correlators in non-conformal $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories from localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-point correlation functions of chiral/anti-chiral operators in SU(N) $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories with massless hyper-multiplets in a representation $\mathcal{R}$ associated with a non-vanishing $\beta$-function. Using supersymmetric localization on the four-sphere $S^4$, these observables can be evaluated by matrix correlators of normal ordered operators. We show that, within a specific regime of validity, standard perturbative calculations based on Feynman diagrams and renormalization procedures in flat space perfectly match the localization predictions up to two loops generalizing and extending previous results. Our analysis highlights that non-trivial interference effects between evanescent terms and the UV poles of the bare coupling are essential for the agreement. On the matrix model side, we employ a direct diagrammatic procedure akin to the Feynman diagram expansion on the field theory description; this simplifies the comparison for generic operators and general matter representation $\mathcal{R}$.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum field theories in inflationary universe: A study with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory (QFT) in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. Our previous work (arXiv:2410.07587) has demonstrated that QFT of Majorana fermions in an arbitrary two-dimensional spacetime can be mapped onto a spin system. In this study, we apply this mapping to investigate the thermal properties of an inflationary universe. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector, known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. In an inflationary universe with Hubble constant $H$, the excitation probability of an Unruh-DeWitt detector follows a thermal distribution with temperature $H/(2\pi)$, indicating that a static observer in the inflationary universe perceives a thermal field. We consider a spin system corresponding to QFT in an inflationary universe and introduce a single spin interacting with this system as an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the detector response asymptotically approaches the result of QFT with an appropriate power of the number of spin sites. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal properties of an inflationary universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Discontinuity Method for Evaluating Scattering Amplitudes within the Worldline Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The worldline formalism offers an alternative framework to the standard diagrammatic approach in quantum field theory, grounded in first-quantized relativistic path integrals. Over recent decades, this formalism has attracted growing interest due to its potential applications and computational advantages. As a result, a collection of worldline master integrals has been derived within this approach. However, efficient mathematical tools for evaluating these integrals remain limited.
  Motivated by unitarity methods used in the conventional formalism of quantum field theory, this work proposes a novel framework for evaluating one-loop worldline master integrals, up to a rational function in the kinematical external invariants, through the computation of their discontinuities. Similarly to standard unitarity techniques, the method involves decomposing an $n$-point one loop amplitude in $D=4$ dimensions into a linear combination of tadpole, bubble, triangle, and box master integrals. The coefficients of this decomposition are rational functions of the external kinematic invariants. Each master integral exhibits a characteristic discontinuity with respect to a specific kinematic invariant. Consequently, the rational coefficients can be determined by directly computing the discontinuities of the corresponding worldline master integrals. In the three-point and four-point on-shell cases, this computation is particularly tractable, as the discontinuities involve Dirac delta functions arising from the Sokhotski-Plemelj formula, which simplify the resulting integrals.
  For the four-point on-shell case, a set of master formulas for the discontinuities is derived. The practical implementation of the proposed discontinuity method is demonstrated through several illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>On local fields invariant under the action of topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look into the problem of constructing and classifying pairs consisting of a local operator and a topological defect which commutes or anticommutes with it. We discuss the bulk and boundary versions of the problem. In the latter one considers a conformal boundary condition, a boundary operator on it and a junction with a topological defect. In the case of the charge conjugation modular invariant commuting configurations in each problem can be obtained when a certain restriction on the fusion rules in realised. We study the corresponding fusion rule problems in detail. While in the bulk case it reduces to realising the $a\times b = c$ fusion rule which was studied in arXiv:2012.14689 [hep-th], in the boundary it leads to a new type of problem. We obtain a full solution to this problem for the $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ WZW theory, thus constructing a class of commuting boundary operators and junctions in that theory, and suggest an approach to general WZW theories.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Higher Spin Symmetries IV: Einstein-Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the analysis of the asymptotic higher spin symmetries developed in the first three parts of this series by considering the minimal coupling of Einstein Gravity and Yang-Mills theory. We show that there exist symmetry parameters that satisfy a collection of dual equations of motion, which allow the construction of an infinite collection of charges that are conserved in the absence of radiation. These Noether charges act on the Einstein Yang-Mills phase space canonically and non-linearly. Their action defines a symmetry algebroid which reduces to a symmetry algebra at non-radiative cuts and generalizes the celestial $sw_{1+\infty}$ algebra. The corresponding symmetry bracket is shown to satisfy the Jacobi identity and an interesting cross-product structure, which is analyzed in details.</description>

      <title>Warming up the Fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux compactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the cosmological observations under appropriate choices of parameters, which originate from their string theory construction. In the present work, we embed such models, originally studied in the cold inflation picture, in the context of warm inflation. We study the viability of different fibre inflation potentials in both strong and weak dissipative regime of warm inflation. In fibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre of a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an interplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The former type of corrections consists of leading-order $\alpha'^3-$ term, higher derivative $F^4-$ correction, and various string loop corrections of KK, log-loop and winding type. Depending on the balance between several corrections, we present four different fibre inflationary potentials and show that the warm inflationary pictures for all of them can successfully fall in the viable window from both Planck and recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of parameters of applicability of these models. Our results also indicate that with the help of a large dissipation ratio, one can achieve a sub-Planckian field excursion, although, this runs on the possibility of moving away from the perturbative control of low-energy four-dimensional supergravity theory.</description>

      <title>Local uniqueness of the Black String with small circle size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study uniqueness of the Black String, i.e. the product of 4-dimensional Schwarzschild space with a circle of length L.
  In arXiv:2410.20967, this was reduced to a non-linear elliptic PDE, and we use this setup to show that for small L the Black String is infinitesimally rigid as a Ricci-flat metric.
  Using a fixed point theorem, we prove that this implies local uniqueness, i.e. there exist no other Ricci-flat metrics near the Black String, and we give bounds for the size of the neighborhood in which the Black String is unique.
  We compare this with the toy problem of a scalar field satisfying an elliptic equation that was already solved in arXiv:2410.20967 using different methods.
  In this case we can use the fixed point theorem method to prove not just a local but a global statement.</description>

      <title>Ensuring continued operation of INSPIRE as a cornerstone of the HEP information infrastructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The INSPIRE platform -- the most widely-used discovery service specifically tailored to the needs of researchers in High Energy Physics (HEP) -- has become a central component of the information infrastructure for the discipline. Despite this, INSPIRE's continued sustainability is frequently endangered by resource constraints, recently made more acute by the loss of support from historical funders changing their research priorities. If the European particle physics community wishes to ensure INSPIRE's long-term sustainability, the community should secure international support and ensure appropriate funding.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $5 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 2.5$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering on Quantum Computers via Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum computational framework using Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) for simulating real-time scattering processes in $(1+1)$-dimensional scalar $\phi^4$ theory. Unlike traditional lattice discretisation methods, HT approximates the quantum field theory Hilbert space by truncating the energy eigenbasis of a solvable reference Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the number of required qubits. Our approach involves preparing initial states as wavepackets through adiabatic evolution from the free-field theory to the interacting regime. We experimentally demonstrate this state preparation procedure on an IonQ trapped-ion quantum device and validate it through quantum simulations, capturing key phenomena such as wavepacket dynamics, interference effects, and particle production post-collision. Detailed resource comparisons highlight the advantages of HT over lattice approaches in terms of qubit efficiency, although we observe challenges associated with circuit depth scaling. Our findings suggest that Hamiltonian Truncation offers a promising strategy for quantum simulations of quantum field theories, particularly as quantum hardware and algorithms continue to improve.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Resonance of black hole quasinormal modes in coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) can exhibit resonant excitations associated with avoided crossings in their complex frequency spectrum. Such resonance phenomena can serve as novel signatures for probing new physics, where additional degrees of freedom are commonly introduced. Motivated by this possibility, we investigate QNMs in systems where multiple degrees of freedom are coupled with each other, and introduce a definition of excitation factors suitable for such systems. To demonstrate our formulation, we apply it to a black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theory, where we find that avoided crossings can appear even between longest-lived modes originating from the fundamental modes of different degrees of freedom, in contrast to the Kerr case in General Relativity. We show that the excitation factors are indeed amplified as a manifestation of resonance at parameter values corresponding to the avoided crossings.</description>

      <title>Do Black Holes With Generalized Entropy Violate Bekenstein Bound?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general yes, but also not quite. It is known that if the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is replaced by some kind of generalized entropy, then the Bekenstein bound may be grossly violated. In this work, we show that this undesired violation can be avoided if we employ the equivalence between generalized entropy and varying-$G$ gravity (GEVAG). In this approach, modifying entropy necessarily also modifies gravity (as one should expect if gravity is indeed inherently tied to thermodynamics), which leads to an effective gravitational "constant" $G_\text{eff}$ that is area-dependent, and a thermodynamic energy that is distinct from the ADM mass. We show that a relaxed Bekenstein bound of the form $S \leqslant CRE$ is always satisfied, albeit the coefficient $C$ is no longer $2\pi$.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Uncertainty Inequality and Breaking of Isospin Symmetry in Atomic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty inequality is used to derive a rigorous lower bound to the amount of isospin impurities, caused by the violation of isospin symmetry in $N=Z$ atomic nuclei, in terms of the difference between the neutron and proton radii and the sum of the charge exchange monopole strengths. We show that the inequality reduces to an identity if one employs a simplified mean field expression for the isovector component of the Coulomb force in first order perturbation theory. The uncertainty inequality is also employed to derive an upper bound to the isovector dipole moment in terms of the amount of isospin impurities, thereby providing an insightful connection between the violation of parity and isospin symmetries.</description>

      <title>Relativistic structure of a supermassive black hole embedded in the dark matter halo of NGC 4649 (M60)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a static, spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution embedded within a dark matter (DM) halo, formulated as a non-vacuum extension of the Schwarzschild spacetime. The DM distribution is modeled via an empirical density profile calibrated to observations of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60), incorporating Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, stellar velocity dispersion data, and globular cluster dynamics. The resultant spacetime metric depends on three independent parameters: the black hole mass $M$, the asymptotic circular velocity $V_c$, and the halo scale radius $a$, and smoothly reduces to the Schwarzschild limit as $V_c \to 0$ and $a \to 0$. We analyze the influence of the halo on key geometric and physical quantities, including the event horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow size, and curvature invariants. The Kretschmann scalar exhibits an enhanced sensitivity to halo-induced modifications, particularly in the near-horizon regime. Thermodynamic properties of the solution are also examined. In the extremal limit, characterized by a vanishing surface gravity, the model supports a finite tangential pressure, implying a non-trivial extension of standard black hole thermodynamics. These results highlight the relevance of incorporating astrophysical environments into BH modeling and offer new avenues for testing strong-field gravity through precision observational data.</description>

      <title>Charged Vortex in Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the charged spinless vortices in the effective field theory of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a gapless neutral scalar field of acoustic phonon. We show that regular static vortex solutions are obtained only for the nonzero critical cubic Yukawa type coupling between neutral and complex scalar fields. Since the Coulombic electric field is exactly cancelled by the phonon, the obtained charged vortices have finite energy. When the quartic self-interaction coupling of complex scalar field has the critical value, the BPS (Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield) bound is saturated for multiple charged vortices of arbitrary separations and hence the borderline of type I and II superconductors is achieved in nonperturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Topological regular black holes without Cauchy horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regular and spherically symmetric black holes that solve the singularity problems of the Schwarzschild solution are phenomenologically viable at large distance but usually suffer from the Cauchy horizon instability. To overcome this drawback, we extended the analysis to include hyperbolic and toroidal horizon topologies within the framework of static, topologically maximally symmetric spacetimes. We show that both hyperbolic and toroidal black holes can be constructed without Cauchy horizons and without curvature singularities, thereby avoiding the mass inflation instability. These solutions exhibit asymptotic flatness in a generalized quasi-Minkowskian sense. The phenomenological aspects of these solutions are also studied by examining their thermodynamical properties, the photon sphere, and the effective potentials, ensuring consistency with observable properties such as black hole shadows. Lastly, we investigate a reconstruction technique within a scalar-tensor gravity framework, illustrating how the discussed metrics can arise from well-defined scalar field dynamics. Our investigation presents a viable pathway for constructing physically realistic, regular black holes in both General Relativity and modified gravity, broadening the landscape of singularity-free spacetimes and offering models that may better reflect the nature of strong gravitational fields in astrophysical and cosmological settings.</description>

      <title>Normal mode analysis within relativistic massive transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the normal mode analysis on the linearized Boltzmann equation for massive particles in the relaxation time approximation. One intriguing feature of massive transport is the coupling of the secular equations between the sound and heat channels. This coupling vanishes as the mass approaches zero. By utilizing the argument principle in complex analysis, we determine the existence condition for collective modes and find the onset transition behavior of collective modes previously observed in massless systems. We numerically determine the critical wavenumber for the existence of each mode under various values of the scaled mass. Within the range of scaled masses considered, the critical wavenumbers for the heat and shear channels decrease with increasing scaled mass, while that of the sound channel exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the scaled mass. In addition, we analytically derive the dispersion relations for these collective modes in the long-wavelength limit. Notably, kinetic theory also incorporates collisionless dissipation effects, known as Landau damping. We find that the branch cut structure responsible for Landau damping differs significantly from the massless case: whereas the massless system features only two branch points, the massive system exhibits an infinite number of such points forming a continuous branch cut.</description>

      <title>The relevance of "on" and "off" transitions in quantum pair production experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments, such as those realized in Bose-Einstein condensates, often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the universe. However, these experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes that alter the intended expansion profile. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark-gluon plasma around the critical point at $T=182$ MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.15. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. Besides, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>

      <title>Attracting without being attracted: Dark Matter as an aether wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that part of what we call dark matter may be the mark of a preferred frame, revealing a breakdown of diffeomorphism invariance. In the non-relativistic limit this appears as a deviant matter source capable of attracting normal matter, but not feeling the attraction from other forms of matter or from itself. While this implies a violation of momentum conservation, no logical inconsistencies arise in this deviant ``Newtonian'' limit. In contrast, due to Bianchi identities, the relativistic theory must undergo core change, and we discuss a modification of Einstein's gravity capable of coupling a non-conserved source to gravity. It results from fixing some of the spatial components of the metric, thereby constraining the possible diffeomorphisms and clipping some of the equations. Bianchi identities can always be used to refill the equations, but the effective Stueckelberg stresses are so outlandish that this defines symmetry breakdown and violations of local energy-momentum conservation. We work out spherically symmetric solutions with static halos and flat rotation curves, with and without a central black hole. The model has the drawback that it can evade experimental constraints simply by setting to zero the local density of deviant matter (which is a non-dynamic input). Its presence, in contrast, would leave inimitable signatures. We briefly discuss the Hamiltonian formulation of these models, where such dark matter appears as a central charge in the Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian and the momentum.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Reconstruction of the Critical Line in the QCD Phase Diagram from Imaginary to Real Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test a technique adopted in the lattice simulations framework, to reconstruct the chiral-phase boundary at real chemical potential, $\mu$, via extrapolation from imaginary $\mu$. We use a low-energy effective model, the Quark-Meson model, both in the mean-field approximation and within the Functional Renormalization Group, the latter in the Local Potential Approximation. The model provides results both for real and imaginary values of $\mu$, thus a direct comparison can be performed between the prediction of the model for real values of $\mu$ and the ones obtained via extrapolation from the results at imaginary $\mu$. We compute an effective convergence radius for the reconstruction technique, $\mu_\mathrm{conv}$, and find $\mu_\mathrm{conv}\approx146$ MeV. This value sustains the validity of the reconstruction technique also for finite and moderate values of the chemical potential. On the other hand, within our model, $\mu_\mathrm{conv}$ is quite smaller then the value of $\mu$ where we find the actual critical endpoint. Near this point of the phase diagram, we find a discrepancy between the actual phase boundary and the one pbtained via extrapolatin of $\approx150\%$. Therefore, our results show that the location of the critical endpoint obtained via reconstruction from imaginary $\mu$ should be considered with due caution</description>

In this paper, I provide a comparison of the prediction for the two-loop six-point maximally helicity-violating (MHV) integrand against the result obtained by use of the leading singularity method. The comparison is performed numerically for a large number of randomly selected momenta and in all cases finds agreement between the two results to high numerical accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1308.4632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the maximal-unitarity formalism at two loops to double-box integrals with four massive external legs. These are relevant for higher-point processes, as well as for heavy vector rescattering, VV -&gt; VV. In this formalism, the two-loop amplitude is expanded over a basis of integrals. We obtain formulas for the coefficients of the double-box integrals, expressing them as products of tree-level amplitudes integrated over specific complex multidimensional contours. The contours are subject to the consistency condition that integrals over them annihilate any integrand whose integral over real Minkowski space vanishes. These include integrals over parity-odd integrands and total derivatives arising from integration-by-parts (IBP) identities. We find that, unlike the zero- through three-mass cases, the IBP identities impose no constraints on the contours in the four-mass case. We also discuss the algebraic varieties connected with various double-box integrals, and show how discrete symmetries of these varieties largely determine the constraints.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a notion of position-space cuts of eikonal diagrams, the set of diagrams appearing in the perturbative expansion of the correlator of a set of straight semi-infinite Wilson lines. The cuts are applied directly to the position-space representation of any such diagram and compute its imaginary part to the leading order in the dimensional regulator. Our cutting prescription thus defines a position-space analog of the standard momentum-space Cutkosky rules. Unlike momentum-space cuts which put internal lines on shell, position-space cuts constrain a number of the gauge bosons exchanged between the energetic partons to be lightlike, leading to a vanishing and a non-vanishing imaginary part for space- and timelike kinematics, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Time in Topological Quantum Gravity of the Ricci Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of topological nonrelativistic quantum gravity associated with a family of Ricci flow equations on Riemannian manifolds. This topological gravity is of the cohomological type, and it exhibits an ${\cal N}=2$ extended BRST symmetry. In our previous work, we constructed this theory in a two-step procedure in the appropriate nonrelativistic ${\cal N}=2$ superspace, first presenting a topological theory of the spatial metric $g_{ij}$, and then adding the superspace versions of the lapse and shift variables $n$ and $n^i$ while gauging the symmetries of foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms. In the relation to Perelman's theory of the Ricci flow, the role of Perelman's dilaton is played by our nonprojectable lapse. Here we demonstrate that this construction is equivalent to a standard one-step BRST gauge-fixing of a theory whose fields are $g_{ij}$, $n^i$ and $n$, and whose gauge symmetries consist of (i) the topological deformations of $g_{ij}$, and (ii) the ultralocal nonrelativistic limit of spacetime diffeomorphisms. The supercharge $Q$ of our superspace construction plays the role of the BRST charge. The spacetime diffeomorphism symmetries appear in an interestingly "shifted" form, which may be of broader interest for nonrelativistic quantum gravity outside of the present topological context. In contrast to the foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms, the gauge symmetries identified in this paper act nonprojectably on time, making it clear that this theory has no local propagating degrees of freedom. We point out an intriguing dual interpretation of the same theory, as a gauge fixing of a dual copy of ultralocal spacetime diffeomorphisms, with the role of ghosts and antighosts interchanged and the second supercharge $\bar Q$ of the ${\cal N}=2$ superalgebra playing the role of the BRST charge in the dual picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $4d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theory obtained by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM). By exploiting supersymmetric localization, we study the integrated correlator of two Coulomb branch and two moment map operators and the integrated correlator of four moment map operators, determining exact expressions valid for any value of the 't Hooft coupling in the planar limit. Additionally, for the second correlator, we obtain an exact expression also for the next-to-planar contribution. Then, we derive the leading terms of their strong-coupling expansions and outline the differences with respect to the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent advances in the understanding of integrability for $AdS_3$ backgrounds, we present a lightning review of this approach, with particular attention to the "tensionless" limits (with zero and one unit of NSNS flux), and to the many integrable deformations of the supergravity backgrounds. Our aim is to concisely but comprehensively take stock of the state of the art in the field, in a way accessible to non-experts, and to highlight outstanding challenges. Along the way we reference where the various derivation of these results, which we mostly omit, can be found in full detail.</description>

      <title>From Operator Product Expansion to Anomalous Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03283v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for computing the renormalization functions, which is based on the ideas of operator product expansion and large momentum expansion. In this method, the renormalization $Z$-factors are determined by the ultraviolet finiteness of Wilson coefficients in the dimensional regularization scheme. The ultraviolet divergence is extracted solely from two-point integrals at the large momentum limit. We develop this method in scalar field theories and establish a general framework for computing anomalous dimensions of fields, mass, couplings and composite operators. In particular, it is applied to the 6-dimensional cubic scalar theory and the 4-dimensional quartic scalar theory. We demonstrate this method by computing the anomalous dimension of the $\phi^Q$ operator in cubic theory up to four loops for arbitrary $Q$, which is in agreement with the known result in the large $N$ limit. The idea of computing anomalous dimensions from the operator production expansion is general and can be extended beyond scalar theories. This is demonstrated through examples of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model with generic operators.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram from Nonlinear Interaction between Superconducting Order and Density: Toward Data-Based Holographic Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address an inverse problem in modeling holographic superconductors. We focus our research on the critical temperature behavior depicted by experiments. We use a physics-informed neural network method to find a mass function $M(F^2)$, which is necessary to understand phase transition behavior. This mass function describes a nonlinear interaction between superconducting order and charge carrier density. We introduce positional embedding layers to improve the learning process in our algorithm, and the Adam optimization is used to predict the critical temperature data via holographic calculation with appropriate accuracy. Consideration of the positional embedding layers is motivated by the transformer model of natural-language processing in the artificial intelligence (AI) field. We obtain holographic models that reproduce borderlines of the normal and superconducting phases provided by actual data. Our work is the first holographic attempt to match phase transition data quantitatively obtained from experiments. Also, the present work offers a new methodology for data-based holographic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extended model with two real scalar fields, $\phi(x,t)$ and $\chi(x,t)$. The first sector is controlled by the sine-Gordon superpotential, while the second field is submitted to the $\chi^4$ one. The fields mutually interact via a nontrivial coupling function $f(\chi)$ that also changes the kinematics of $\phi$. We briefly review the implementation of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) prescription. We then solve the resulting BPS equations for two different interactions $f$. The first one leads to a single kink-kink configuration, while the second one gives rise to a inhomogeneous sine-Gordon kink lattice. We study the linear stability of these new solutions, focusing on their translational modes. We also explore how the strength of the mutual interaction affects the BPS profiles. In particular, we show that a homogeneous lattice with identical kinks is attained in the regime of extremely strong interactions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate canonically quantized open string solutions associated to the analytically continued action for the recently proposed tropical limit of topological A-type models, tropological sigma models, with various boundary conditions. These solutions naturally give rise to a non-relativistic counterpart of branes, which we name tropical branes. We provide a preliminary worldsheet description of these tropical branes, laying the groundwork for an upcoming paper that will explore the role of tropical branes in the context of brane quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a relation between the brane configurations consisting of D3-branes and 5-brane webs which realize 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories and quantum curves by focusing on the $S^{3}$ partition functions. In particular, we conjecture that the Newton polygons of the quantum curves are equal to the toric diagrams which are dual to the 5-brane webs. For brane configurations whose worldvolume theories have Lagrangian descriptions, we show an explicit derivation of the relation by using the supersymmetric localization and the Fermi gas formalism. We also provide some evidence of the conjecture for non-Lagrangian theories. We see that our conjecture gives us new matrix models for 5-brane webs including a $\left(p,q\right)$5-brane with arbitrary $p$. This leads to explicit relations between the brane configurations, the matrix models and genus one quantum curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct families of integrable deformations that interpolate between $AdS_3\times S^3\times S^3\times S^1$ and either $AdS_3\times S^3\times S^2\times T^2$ or $AdS_3\times S^2\times S^2\times T^3$. They preserve half of the supersymmetry of the original background, namely one copy of the $\mathfrak{d}(2,1;\alpha)$ algebra. From this it follows a similar integrable interpolation between $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ and $AdS_3\times S^2\times T^5$, which also preserves half of the supersymmetry, namely a copy of the $\mathfrak{psu}(1,1|2)$ algebra. In all cases, the interpolating backgrounds are constructed by using TsT transformations, which makes it easy to implement them in the integrability formalism in the full quantum theory. To illustrate this point, we discuss the lightcone gauge fixing of the models and compute their pp-wave Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and structure constants of E-series minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ADE classification of Virasoro minimal models, the E-series is the sparsest: their central charges $c=1-6\frac{(p-q)^2}{pq}$ are not dense in the half-line $c\in (-\infty,1)$, due to $q=12,18,30$ taking only 3 values -- the Coxeter numbers of $E_6, E_7, E_8$. The E-series is also the least well understood, with few known results beyond the spectrum.
  Here, we use a semi-analytic bootstrap approach for numerically computing 4-point correlation functions. We deduce non-chiral fusion rules, i.e. which 3-point structure constants vanish. These vanishings can be explained by constraints from null vectors, interchiral symmetry, simple currents, extended symmetries, permutations, and parity, except in one case for $q=30$. We conjecture that structure constants are given by a universal expression built from the double Gamma function, times polynomial functions of $\cos(\pi\frac{p}{q})$ with values in $\mathbb{Q}\big(\cos(\frac{\pi}{q})\big)$, which we work out explicitly for $q=12$.
  We speculate on generalizing E-series minimal models to generic integer values of $q$, and recovering loop CFTs as $p,q\to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present exact results in softly-broken supersymmetric $\text{SU}(N_C)$ chiral gauge theories with charged fermions in one antisymmetric, $N_F$ fundamental, and $N_C+N_F-4$ anti-fundamental representations. We achieve this by considering the supersymmetric version of these theories and utilizing anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking at a scale $m \ll \Lambda$ to generate a vacuum. The connection to non-supersymmetric theories is then conjectured in the limit $m \rightarrow \infty$. For odd $N_C$, we determine the massless fermions and unbroken global symmetries in the infrared. For even $N_C$, we find global symmetries are non-anomalous and no massless fermions. In all cases, the symmetry breaking patterns differ from what the tumbling hypothesis would suggest.</description>

      <title>On 5-point conformal block with level 2 degenerate field insertion and its AGT dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and explore recursive methods to investigate the 2d CFT 5-point conformal block with a level 2 degenerate insertion, as well as its AGT dual, by solving the BPZ differential equation. First, we represent the solution of the differential equation as a double series expansion. On the 2-node quiver gauge theory side, this corresponds to the instanton series. We then demonstrate that the expansion coefficients are uniquely determined by a recursion relation. Inspired by the approach initiated in a paper by D. Gaiotto and J. Teschner, we partially resum this series and show that the result can be elegantly expressed in terms of a single hypergeometric function and its derivative. This new representation makes it straightforward to relate different asymptotic regions. As a by-product, this provides us a simple derivation of fusion and braiding coefficients.
  We describe the subtle procedure of merging the degenerate field with the outgoing state, thereby obtaining a generic 4-point block, which on the gauge theory side corresponds to the partition function of $SU(2)$ gauge theory with four massive hypermultiplets in the $\Omega$-background.
  Finally, we performed several nontrivial checks that confirm our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Six-dimensional chiral gauged Einstein-Maxwell supergravity admits a two-parameter rotating dyonic string solution whose near horizon limit is the direct product of AdS$_3$ and a squashed three-sphere $S^3$. For a particular relation between the two parameters, the solution preserves $1/2$ supersymmetry. We determine the complete Kaluza-Klein spectrum of the theory around these AdS$_3$ backgrounds. For the supersymmetric backgrounds, the states organize into infinite towers of long and short multiplets of OSp(2|2). In a certain limit of parameters, both the supersymmetric and the non-supersymmetric spectra exhibit scale separation. In the latter case there are five topologically massive vectors and five scalars retaining finite masses with integer conformal dimensions, and in the supersymmetric case there are supersymmetric partners with half integer conformal dimensions, while all other masses diverge.</description>

      <title>Twists of trigonometric sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-twisted trigonometric sigma models, a new class of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model. Starting from 4d Chern-Simons theory on a cylinder, the models are constructed by introducing a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ branch cut running along the non-compact direction. As we pass through the branch cut we apply a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ automorphism to the algebra-valued and group-valued fields of the theory. Two instances of models in this class have appeared in the literature and we explain how these fit into our general construction. We generalise both to the case of $\mathbb{Z}_N$-twistings, and for each we construct two further deformations, leading to four doubly-deformed models.
  Mapping the cylinder to a sphere, a novel feature of the construction is that the branch points are at the simple poles corresponding to the ends of the cylinder. As a result, the untwisted and twisted models have the same number of degrees of freedom. While twisting does not always lead to inequivalent models, we show that if we use the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ outer automorphism of $\mathfrak{g}^{\mathbb{C}} = \mathfrak{sl}(n;\mathbb{C})$ to twist, then the untwisted and twisted models have different symmetries, hence the latter are new integrable sigma models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as "sandwich conditions": The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>Time-Ordering in the Dyson-Unruh Problem: Accelerated Observers and Quantum Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of time-ordered perturbative expansions in quantum field theory (QFT) in curved spacetime, focusing on the interaction between a scalar field and multiple Unruh-DeWitt detectors undergoing uniform acceleration. Assuming the existence of a timelike Killing vector field, which serves as a global time coordinate, we express each detector's proper time in terms of this global time and consistently implement time-ordering in the Dyson series. Using light-cone coordinates and detector worldlines, we construct all possible interaction terms for two detectors at first, second, and third orders in perturbation theory. Our formalism enables a systematic classification of contributions to the S-matrix, resolving ordering ambiguities that arise due to differing accelerations and causal structure.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of two-loop master contours</title>

      <description>arXiv:1205.0801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized-unitarity calculations of two-loop amplitudes are performed by expanding the amplitude in a basis of master integrals and then determining the coefficients by taking a number of generalized cuts. In this paper, we present a complete classification of the solutions to the maximal cut of integrals with the double-box topology. The ideas presented here are expected to be relevant for all two-loop topologies as well. We find that these maximal-cut solutions are naturally associated with Riemann surfaces whose topology is determined by the number of states at the vertices of the double-box graph. In the case of four massless external momenta we find that, once the geometry of these Riemann surfaces is properly understood, there are uniquely defined master contours producing the coefficients of the double-box integrals in the basis decomposition of the two-loop amplitude. This is in perfect analogy with the situation in one-loop generalized unitarity.
  In addition, we point out that the chiral integrals recently introduced by Arkani-Hamed et al. can be used as master integrals for the double-box contributions to the two-loop amplitudes in any gauge theory. The infrared finiteness of these integrals allow for their coefficients as well as their integrated expressions to be evaluated in strictly four dimensions, providing significant technical simplification. We evaluate these integrals at four points and obtain remarkably compact results.</description>

      <title>About the (in)equivalence between holonomic versus non-holonomic theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scenarios in which a holonomic versus a non-holonomic frame description of gravity theories are equivalent. It turns out that classically, the equivalence holds in a way that is independent of the particular dynamics and/or spacetime dimension. This includes general metric-affine dynamics. A global bundle-theoretical investigation is carried out, uncovering the equivalence principle as the culprit. The equivalence holds as long as the equivalence principle holds. This is not something to be expected when non-invertible configurations of the vielbein field are taken into account. In such case, the gauge-theoretical description of gravity unsolders from spacetime, and one has to decide if gravity is spacetime geometry or an internal gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Computable and Faithful Lower Bound on Entanglement Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing the generalized divergence of $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are non-PPT (NPT), establishing their faithfulness for the resource theory of NPT entanglement. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of quantum states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a topological quantum field theory phase for four-dimensional gravity. We show it is able to generate, not only General Relativity, but the whole family of Lovelock-Cartan theories of gravity. This is accomplished due to the existence of a topological symmetry which, when explicitly broken via the introduction of a mass scale, releases the local degrees of freedom of gravity. Additionally, we introduce an extended notion of the (anti-)self-dual Landau gauge conditions to evaluate the Ward identities, counterterms, and prove the quantum stability of the model, to all orders in perturbation theory, using the algebraic renormalization technique.</description>

      <title>Einstein gravity from the Einstein action: Counterterms and covariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field equations of general relativity can be derived from the Einstein action, which is quadratic in connection coefficients, rather than the standard action involving the Gibbons-Hawking-York term and counterterm. We show that it is possible to construct a new counterterm directly for the Einstein action, which removes divergences and naturally introduces a flat reference spacetime. The total action is then covariant under simultaneous transformation of both the spacetime and reference tetrads, and argue that this is analogous to the Gibbons-Hawking action. We then explore different perspectives arising naturally from different uses of the reference tetrad, and explore implications of viewing gravity as fundamentally described in terms of non-covariant connection coefficients.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion-vortex hybrid and spin wave solutions in superconducting ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of Ferromagnetism and superconductivity in so called ferromagnetic superconductors is an intriguing phenomenon which may lead to novel physical effects as well as applications. Here in this work we have explored the interplay of topological excitations, namely vortices and skyrmions, in ferromagnetic superconductors using a field theoretic description of such systems. In particular, numerical solutions for the continuous spin field compatible to a given vortex profile are determined in absence and presence of a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) term. The solutions show that the spin configuration is like a skyrmion but intertwined with the vortex structure -- the radius of the the skyrmion-like solution depends on the penetration depth and also the polarity of the skyrmion depends on the sign of the winding number. Thus our solution describes a novel topological structure -- namely a skyrmion-vortex composite. We have also determined the spin wave solutions in such systems in presence and absence of a vortex. In absence of vortex frequency and wave vector satisfy a cubic equation which leads to various interesting features. In particular, we have shown that in the low frequency regime the minimum in dispersion relation shifts from $k=0$ to a non zero $k$ value depending on the parameters. We also discuss the nature of spin wave dispersion in the $\omega \sim \Tilde{m}$ regime which shows a similar pattern in the dispersion curve. The group velocity of the spin wave would change it's sign across such a minimum which is unique to FMSC. Also, the spin wave modes around the local minimum looks like roton mode in superfluid and hence called a magnetic roton. In presence of a vortex, the spin wave amplitude is shown to vary spatially such that the profile looks like that of a N\'eel Skyrmion. Possible experimental signature of both solutions are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exponentially fast scrambling of an initial state characterizes quantum chaotic systems. Given the importance of quickly populating higher energy levels from low-energy states in quantum battery charging protocols, this work investigates the role of quantum scrambling in quantum batteries and its effect on optimal power and charging times by means of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, a maximally-chaotic black hole physics model that has been recently proposed as a quantum battery. We adopt a bare representation with normalized bandwidths to suppress system energy dependence. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth exploration of quantum scrambling in the context of quantum batteries. By analyzing the dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators, our findings indicate that quantum scrambling does not necessarily lead to faster charging, despite its potential for accelerating the process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic (super)strings offer promising ways to test ideas about the early universe and physics at high energies. While in field theory constructions their tension is usually assumed to be constant (or at most slowly-varying), this is often not the case in the context of String Theory. Indeed, the tensions of both fundamental and field theory strings within a string compactification depend on the expectation values of the moduli, which in turn can vary with time. We discuss how the evolution of a cosmic string network changes with a time-dependent tension, both for long-strings and closed loops, by providing an appropriate generalisation of the Velocity One Scale (VOS) model and its implications. The resulting phenomenology is very rich, exhibiting novel features such as growing loops, percolation and a radiation-like behaviour of the long string network. We conclude with a few remarks on the impact for gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations, restricting the trajectories. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not a Lagrangian system as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting the dynamics could be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations for the original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is a particle in a central field with varying trajectories restricted by the equation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space acquires one more dimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for the precession of trajectories. The second example is linearized gravity with the Einstein-Hilbert action, and the class of varying fields is restricted by the linearized Nordstr\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain, which is efficiently simulated on both classical and quantum computers. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>

Abstract: The use of the vacuum projector $|0 \rangle \langle 0| $ and of the unitary Weyl operators enables us to construct a set of Hermitian dichotomic operators in relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory in Minkowski spacetime. Employing test functions supported in diamond regions, both Bell and Mermin inequalities are studied by means of a numerical setup. In addition to reporting expressive violations of both inequalities, the cluster property is also checked.</description>

      <title>Physical Interpretations of Integration Constants and Large Gauge Effects in Flat and AdS Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As in other partial differential equations, one ends up with some arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions when one integrates Einstein's equations, or more generally field equations of any other gravity. Interpretation of these arbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can, in principle, be measured is a non-trivial matter. Concentrating on the case of constants, one usually identifies them as conserved mass, momentum, angular momentum, center of mass, or some other hairs of the solution. This can be done via the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)-type construction based on pure geometry, and the solution is typically a black hole. Hence, one talks about the black hole mass and angular momentum, etc. Here we show that there are several misunderstandings: First of all, the physical interpretation of the constants of a given geometry depends not only on pure geometry, i.e. the metric, but also on the theory under consideration. This becomes quite important, especially when there is a cosmological constant. Secondly, one usually assigns the maximally symmetric spacetime, say the flat or the (anti)-de Sitter spacetime, to have zero mass and angular momentum and linear momentum. This declares the maximally symmetric spacetime to be the vacuum of the theory, but such an assignment depends on the coordinates in the ADM-type constructions and their extensions: in fact, one can introduce large gauge transformations (new coordinates) which map, say, the flat spacetime to flat spacetime but the resultant flat spacetime can have a nontrivial mass and angular momentum, if the new coordinates are such that the metric components do not decay properly. These issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a resolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor, will be shown for the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The entropy of dynamical de Sitter horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole. We lift this construction to the cosmological event horizon of an asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. By introducing a nontrivial correction term, we generalize Gibbons and Hawking's first law of event horizons to non-stationary eras. We also develop the non-stationary physical process first law between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections for the cosmological event horizon.</description>

      <title>Quantized Axial Charge in the Hamiltonian Approach to Wilson Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of 1+1~D staggered fermions and reconstruct vector and axial charge operators, found by Arkya Chatterjee et al., using the Wilson fermion formalism. These operators commute with the Hamiltonian and become the generators of vector and axial $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetries in the continuum limit. An interesting feature of the axial charge operator is that it acts locally on operators and has quantized eigenvalues in momentum space. Therefore, the eigenstates of this operator can be interpreted as fermion states with a well-defined integer chirality, analogous to those in the continuum theory. This allows us to realize a gauge theory where the axial $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry acts as a gauge symmetry. We construct a Hamiltonian using the eigenstates of the axial charge operator, preserving exact axial symmetry on the lattice and vector symmetry in the continuum. As applications, we examine the implementation of the Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG) mechanism in the $1^4(-1)^4$ and 3-4-5-0 models. Our formulation supports symmetry-preserving interactions with quantized chiral charges, although further numerical studies are required to verify the SMG mechanism in interacting models.</description>

      <title>Corrections of the GR eikonal limit by a class of renormalizable gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, the scattering between a light scalar particle $\phi$ and a heavy scalar $\sigma$ is studied in the eikonal limit, for gravity scenarios containing higher order derivatives, studied in [1]-[6]. It is suggested that if one of the new gravity scales introduced in the higher order action is smaller than the Planck mass, for instance of the order of $M_{GUT}\sim 10^{15}$ GeV, the functional form of the GR eikonal formulas appears enhanced. However, for these new models, the conditions for the eikonal approximation to hold has to be revised, as the introduction of new scales may change the allowed center of mass and impulse transfer scales. This issue is analyzed in the text. The statements of the present work however should be taken with care, as the Schwarzschild radius for these polynomials theories is not yet established. The results presented here, in our opinion, are in agreement with the suppression of corrections pointed out \cite{brandhuber}, \cite{fradkin} and \cite{deser} in for the Stelle gravity. The next to leading order approximation and part of the seagull diagrams are estimated. Different to the GR case, this order generically is non vanishing. An explicit regularization scheme is presented, based on Riesz and Hadamard procedures. The need of a regularization is partially expected, as the inclusion of small energy fluctuations may spoil the eikonal approximation.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memory function description of quantum operator dynamics involves a carefully chosen split into 'fast' and 'slow' modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. One common approach is to form a Krylov operator basis $\{O_m \}_{m\ge 0}$, and then approximate the dynamics restricted to the 'fast space' $\{O_m \}_{m\ge n}$ for $n\gg 1$. Denoting the fast space Green's function by $G_n (z)$, in this work we prove that $G_n (z)$ exhibits universality in the $n \to \infty$ limit, approaching different universal scaling forms in different regions of the complex $z$-plane. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT). At finite $z$, we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, the same as the average bulk resolvent for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. When $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application we give a new numerical method, the spectral bootstrap, for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof is complex analytic in nature, involving a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. This proof technique assumes some regularity conditions on the spectral function, and we comment on their possible connections to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We are led via steepest-descent to a related Coulomb gas ensemble, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the 'Operator Growth Hypothesis'--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. We then explain the implications of this criticality for the computational resources required to estimate transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A field theory of a Schr\"{o}dinger type complex scalar field of Cooper pair, a U(1) gauge field of electromagnetism, and a neutral scalar field of gapless acoustic phonon is proposed for superconductivity of s-waves. Presence of the gapless neutral scalar field is justified as low energy residual acoustic phonon degrees in the context of effective field theory. The critical coupling of quartic self-interaction of complex scalar field is computed from a 1-loop level interaction balance between the repulsion mediated by massive degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by massive Higgs degree, in the static limit. The obtained net attraction or repulsion in perturbative regime matches the type I or II superconductivity, respectively. We find the new critical coupling of cubic Yukawa type interaction between the neutral and complex scalar fields from another tree level interaction balance between the Coulomb repulsion mediated by massless degree of the U(1) gauge field and the attraction mediated by the gapless neutral scalar field, in the static limit. Superconducting phase is realized at or in the vicinity of this critical coupling. A huge discrepancy between the propagation speeds of photon and phonon gives a plausible explanation on low critical temperatures in conventional superconductors.</description>
