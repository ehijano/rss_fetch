      <title>Two-dimensional equilibrium configurations in Korteweg fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, after reviewing the form of the constitutive equations for a third grade Korteweg fluid, recently derived by means of an extended Liu procedure, an equilibrium problem is investigated. By considering a two--dimensional setting, it is derived a single nonlinear elliptic equation such that the equilibrium conditions are identically satisfied. Such an equation is discussed both analytically and numerically. Moreover, by considering a particular boundary value problem of Dirichlet type, some preliminary numerical solutions are presented.</description>

      <title>The Huang-Yang conjecture for the low-density Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work establishes a three-term asymptotic expansion of the ground state energy of a dilute gas of spin $1/2$ fermions with repulsive short-range interactions, validating a formula predicted by Huang and Yang in 1957. The formula is universal in the sense that it holds for a large class of interaction potentials and depends on those only via their scattering length. We have recently proved an upper bound on the ground state energy of the desired form, and the present work completes the program by proving the matching lower bound.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical aspects of fermions in external electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of Dirac fields under the influence of external electromagnetic fields is studied. For perturbations which act only for finite time, the influence of the perturbation can be described by an automorphism which can be unitarily implemented in the GNS representations of KMS states, a result long known for the Fock representation. For time-independent perturbations, however, the time evolution cannot be implemented in typical cases, so the standard methods of quantum statistical mechanics do not apply. Instead we show that a smooth switching on of the external potential allows a comparison of the free and the perturbed time evolution, and approach to equilibrium, a possible existence of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS) and Araki's relative entropy can be investigated.</description>

      <title>Spin transport and lack of quantisation in the $A\mathrm{II}$ class on the honeycomb structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin transport in a class of two-dimensional $A\mathrm{II}$ insulators on the honeycomb structure, the Kane-Mele model being an emblematic example in this class. We derive the spin conductivity by the linear response \`a la Kubo and show that it is well-defined and independent of the choice of the spin current. For models that do not conserve the spin, we demonstrate that the deviation of the spin conductivity from the quantised value is, at worst, quadratic in the spin-non-conserving terms, thus improving previous results. Additionally, we show that the leading-order corrections are actually quadratic for some models in the class, demonstrating that the spin conductivity is not universally quantised. Consequently, our results show that, in general, there is no direct connection between the spin conductivity and the Fu-Kane-Mele index.</description>

      <title>Discrete Boltzmann Equation for Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-classical approach to the study of the evolution of anyonic excitations--elementary particles with fractional statistics, complementing bosons and fermions--is through the Boltzmann equation for anyons. This work reviews a discretized version--a system of partial differential equations--of such a quantum equation. Trend to equilibrium is studied for a planar stationary system, as well as the spatially homogeneous system. Essential properties of the linearized operator are proven, implying that results for general steady half-space problems for the discrete Boltzmann equation in a slab geometry can be applied.</description>

      <title>Modeling extreme events and intermittency in turbulent diffusion with a mean gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Viscoelasticity of biomimetic scale beams from trapped complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of a biomimetic scale-covered beam in which shear-dependent complex fluids are trapped between overlapping scales under bending loads. These fluids mimic biological mucus and slime layers commonly enveloping the skins found in nature. An energy-based analytical model is developed to quantify the interplay between substrate elasticity, scale geometry, and fluid rheology at multiple length scales. Constant strain rate and oscillatory bending are examined for Newtonian, shear-thinning, and shear-thickening fluids. The analysis reveals unique, geometry- and rate-dependent viscoelastic response, distinct from classical mechanisms such as material dissipation, frictional resistance, or air drag. Energy dissipation is shown to emerge from a nonlinear coupling of tribological parameters, fluid rheology, and system kinematics, exhibiting distinct regime-differentiated characteristics. The model captures the competitions and cooperations between elastic and geometrical parameters to influence the viscoelastic behavior and lead to geometry and rheology scaling laws for relative energy dissipation. The pronounced nonlinearity in the moment-curvature relationships, along with the geometry-controlled regimes of performance, highlights the potential for using tailored and engineered complex inks for soft robotics and smart damping systems.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Probability Measure and the Coupling Parameters in a Curie-Weiss Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Curie-Weiss model is used to study phase transitions in statistical mechanics and has been the object of rigorous analysis in mathematical physics. We analyse the problem of reconstructing the probability measure of a multi-group Curie-Weiss model from a sample of data by employing the maximum likelihood estimator for the coupling parameters of the model, under the assumption that there is interaction within each group but not across group boundaries. The estimator has a number of positive properties, such as consistency, asymptotic normality, and exponentially decaying probabilities of large deviations of the estimator with respect to the true parameter value. A shortcoming in practice is the necessity to calculate the partition function of the Curie-Weiss model, which scales exponentially with respect to the population size. There are a number of applications of the estimator in political science, sociology, and automated voting, centred on the idea of identifying the degree of social cohesion in a population. In these applications, the coupling parameter is a natural way to quantify social cohesion. We treat the estimation of the optimal weights in a two-tier voting system, which requires the estimation of the coupling parameter.</description>

      <title>Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored Non-Markovian Quantum Systems with a Markovian Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system.
  Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) are determined by the "diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the "off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood.
  Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum-observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces.
  Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Soliton resolution for the coupled complex short pulse equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the long-time asymptotics of the solution to the Cauchy problem of ccSP (coupled complex short pulse) equation on the line for decaying initial data that can support solitons. The ccSP system describes ultra-short pulse propagation in optical fibers, which is a completely integrable system and posses a $4\times4$ matrix Wadati--Konno--Ichikawa type Lax pair. Based on the $\bar{\partial}$-generalization of the Deift--Zhou steepest descent method, we obtain the long-time asymptotic approximations of the solution in two kinds of space-time regions under a new scale $(\zeta,t)$. The solution of the ccSP equation decays as a speed of $O(t^{-1})$ in the region $\zeta/t&gt;\varepsilon$ with any $\varepsilon&gt;0$; while in the region $\zeta/t&lt;-\varepsilon$, the solution is depicted by the form of a multi-self-symmetric soliton/composite breather and $t^{-1/2}$ order term arises from self-symmetric soliton/composite breather-radiation interactions as well as an residual error order $O(t^{-1}\ln t)$.</description>

      <title>Moduli of stable supermaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of stable supermap from SUSY curves to a fixed target superscheme, and prove that when the target is (super)projective, stable supermaps are parameterized by an algebraic superstack with superschematic and separated diagonal. We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps from spin curves to the bosonic reduction of the target, whose fibers are linear schemes; for this reason, the moduli superstack of stable supermaps is not proper unless such linear schemes reduce to a point. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the moduli superstack, which agrees with the characterization of the bosonic reduction just mentioned and with the dimension formula for the case of bosonic target existing in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scattering by metamaterials with negative indices of refraction, which are known to support \emph{surface plasmons} -- long-lived states that are highly localized at the boundary of the cavity. This type of states has found uses in a variety of modern technologies. In this article, we study surface plasmons in the setting of non-trapping cavities; i.e. when all billiard trajectories outside the cavity escape to infinity. We characterize the indices of refraction which support surface plasmons, show that the corresponding resonances lie super-polynomially close to the real axis, describe the localization properties of the corresponding resonant states, and give an asymptotic formula for their number.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For ageing systems with dynamical exponent $\mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise coming from the thermal bath, the form of the two-time autocorrelator as well as the time-space form of the single-time correlator are derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance, generalised to non-equilibrium ageing. These findings reproduce the exact results in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model at $T=0$ and the critical spherical model in $d&gt;2$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Tsirelson's Theorems via Approximate Schur's Lemma and Probabilistic Stampfli's Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tsirelson showed that, in finite dimensions, quantum correlations generated by commuting observables--measurements associated with distinct parties whose operators mutually commute--are equivalent to those obtainable from measurements on separate tensor product factors. We generalize this foundational result to the setting of $\epsilon$-almost commuting observables, establishing two distinct quantitative approximate Tsirelson's theorems. Both theorems show that if a $d$-dimensional bipartite quantum strategy's observables $\epsilon$-almost commute, then they are within $O(\mathrm{poly}(d) \epsilon)$ (in operator norm) of observables from a genuine tensor product strategy. This provides a quantitative counterpart to the asymptotic result of [N. Ozawa, J. Math. Phys. 54, 032202 (2013)] and justifies the tensor product model as an effective model even when subsystem independence is only approximately satisfied.
  Our theorems arise from two different but complementary formulations of almost commutation: (i) The first approach utilizes deterministic operator norm bounds relative to specific matrix generators (such as clock and shift matrices), leading to an approximate Schur's Lemma from which the first theorem directly follows. (ii) The second approach employs probabilistic bounds, requiring small commutators only on average against Haar-random single-qubit unitaries. This method yields two novel probabilistic Stampfli's theorems, quantifying distance to scalars based on probabilistic commutation, a result which may be of independent interest. These theorems set the basis for the second approximate Tsirelson's theorem.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of robust entanglement generation in engineered XX spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation comparing two entanglement generation protocols in finite XX spin chains with varying spin magnitudes ($s = 1/2, 1, 3/2 $). Protocol 1 (P1) relies on staggered couplings to steer correlations toward the ends of the chain. At the same time, Protocol 2 (P2) adopts a dual-port architecture that uses optimized boundary fields to mediate virtual excitations between terminal spins. Our results show that P2 consistently outperforms P1 in all spin values, generating higher-fidelity entanglement in shorter timescales when evaluated under the same system parameters. Furthermore, P2 exhibits superior robustness under realistic imperfections, including diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, as well as dephasing noise. These advantages stem from its ability to suppress the bulk population and minimize susceptibility to decoherence. Together, the scalability, efficiency, and noise resilience of the dual-port approach position it as a promising framework for entanglement distribution in solid-state quantum information platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connectivity is a fundamental property of quantum graphs, previously studied in the operator system model for matrix quantum graphs and via graph homomorphisms in the quantum adjacency matrix model. In this paper, we develop an algebraic characterization of connectivity for general quantum graphs within the quantum adjacency matrix framework. Our approach extends earlier results to the non-tracial setting and beyond regular quantum graphs. We utilize a quantum Perron-Frobenius theorem that provides a spectral characterization of connectivity, and we further characterize connectivity in terms of the irreducibility of the quantum adjacency matrix and the nullity of the associated graph Laplacian. These results are obtained using the KMS inner product, which unifies and generalizes existing formulations.</description>

      <title>On dual regime in Yang-Baxter deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a new class of integrable sigma models, which we refer to as the "dual regime" of Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models. This dual regime manifests itself in the conformal perturbation approach. Namely, it is well known that conventional YB-deformed $\mathrm{O}(N)$ sigma models are described in the UV by a collection of free bosonic fields perturbed by some relevant operators. The holomorphic parts of these operators play the role of screening operators which define certain integrable systems in the free theory. All of these integrable systems depend on a continuous parameter $b$, which parametrizes the central charge, and are known to possess the duality under $b^2\longleftrightarrow -1-b^2$. Although $\mathrm{O}(2N+1)$ integrable systems are self-dual, $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ systems are not. In particular, the $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ integrable systems provide new perturbations of the sigma model type. We identify the corresponding one-loop metric and $B-$field and show that they solve the generalized Ricci flow equation.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix of the XXZ chain in the massless regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The free energy per lattice site of a quantum spin chain in the thermodynamic limit is determined by a single `dominant' Eigenvalue of an associated quantum transfer matrix in the infinite Trotter number limit. For integrable quantum spin chains, related with solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, an appropriate choice of the quantum transfer matrix enables to study its spectrum, e.g.\ by means of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. In its turn, the knowledge of the full spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance of a conformal spectrum in the low-temperature regime. More generally, accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators for the spin chain under consideration. These are statements that have been established by physicists on a heuristic level and that are calling for a rigorous mathematical justification. In this work we implement certain aspects of this programme with the example of the XXZ quantum spin chain in the antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low-temperature limit. We rigorously establish the existence, uniqueness and characterise the form of the solutions to the non-linear integral equations that are equivalent to the Bethe Ansatz equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model. This allows us to describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to the Bethe Ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite Trotter number limit. Within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify the dominant Eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge in the low-temperature limit are given, to the leading order, by the spectrum of the free Boson $c=1$ conformal field theory. This rigorously establishes a long-standing conjecture present in the physics literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize a classical inequality between the eigenvalues of the Laplacians with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on bounded, planar domains: in 1955, Payne proved that below the $k$-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian there exist at least $k + 2$ eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian, provided the domain is convex. It has, however, been conjectured that this should hold for any domain. Here we show that the statement indeed remains true for all simply connected planar Lipschitz domains. The proof relies on a novel variational principle.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT correspondence, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider long-range percolation, Ising model, and self-avoiding walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, with couplings decaying like $|x|^{-(d+\alpha)}$ where $0 &lt; \alpha \le 2$, above the upper critical dimensions. In the spread-out setting where the lace expansion applies, we show that the two-point function for each of these models exactly coincides with a random walk two-point function, up to a constant prefactor. Using this, for $0&lt;\alpha &lt; 2$, we prove upper and lower bounds of the form $|x|^{-(d-\alpha)} \min\{ 1, (p_c - p)^{-2} |x|^{-2\alpha} \}$ for the two-point function near the critical point $p_c$. For $\alpha=2$, we obtain a similar upper bound with logarithmic corrections. We also give a simple proof of the convergence of the lace expansion, assuming diagrammatic estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full three-body problem, on the motion of three celestial bodies under their mutual gravitational attraction, is one of the oldest unsolved problems in classical mechanics. The main difficulty comes from the presence of unstable and chaotic motions, which make long-term prediction impossible. In this paper, we show that the full three-body problem exhibits a strong form of instability known as Arnold diffusion. We consider the planar full three-body problem, formulated as a perturbation of both the Kepler problem and the planar circular restricted three-body problem. We show that the system exhibits Arnold diffusion, in the sense that there is a transfer of energy -- of an amount independent of the perturbation parameter -- between the Kepler problem and the restricted three-body problem. Our argument is based on the topological method of correctly aligned windows, which is implemented into a computer assisted proof. We demonstrate that the approach can be applied to physically relevant masses of the bodies, choosing a Neptune-Triton-asteroid system as an example. In this case, we obtain explicit estimates for the range of the perturbation parameter and for the diffusion time.</description>

      <title>The Sky as a Killing Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Physical ageing from generalised time-translation-invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalised form of time-translation-invariance permits to re-derive the known generic phenomenology of ageing, which arises in classical many-body systems after a quench from an initially disordered system to a temperature $T\leq T_c$, at or below the critical temperature $T_c$. Generalised time-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of representation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of scale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences include the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the two-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the auto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\lambda_C=\lambda_R$, the cross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the explanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or auto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\gg 1$ to a plateau. For global two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical slip exponent $\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures below criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their finite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence of the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all temperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the relevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived, taking the dimensionality of couplings into account. Its applicability in a wide class of models is confirmed, for temperatures $T\leq T_c$. Relevance to experiments is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra and show that it is a Hopf algebra subject to certain conditions. The associated universal R-matrix is also obtained via an admissible Drinfel'd twist. The structure of braces emerges naturally in this context by requiring the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra to be a Hopf algebra and a quasi-triangular bialgebra after twisting. The fundamental representation of the universal R-matrix yields the familiar set-theoretic (combinatorial) solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We then apply the same Drinfel'd twist to the gl_n Yangian after introducing the augmented Yangian. We show that the augmented Yangian is also a Hopf algebra and we also obtain its twisted version.</description>

Abstract: In this article we discuss the magnetic Schroedinger operator $H= (i \nabla +A)^2-V$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a non-negative potential $V$ supported over the tube built along a curve which is a local deformation of a straight one, and the magnetic field $B := \mathrm{rot}(A)$ is assumed to be nonzero and local. For the latter, we prove that the magnetic field does not change the essential spectrum of this system, and investigate a sufficient condition for the discrete spectrum of $H$ to be empty.</description>
