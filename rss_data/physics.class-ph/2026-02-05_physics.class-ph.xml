      <title>On the commutation of variation and differentiation in nonholonomic Systems: A Chetaev-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derivation of the equations of motion for nonholonomic systems remains a central issue in analytical mechanics, primarily due to the tension between the d'Alembert-Lagrange differential principle and integral variational approaches. This study investigates the validity of the commutation relation between the variational operator and the time derivative, which is a geometric identity in holonomic manifolds but becomes problematic when dealing with velocity-dependent constraints. By analyzing the transposition rule, we define a formal relationship between the Chetaev variation and the total variation of the constraints. We show that the simultaneous requirement of kinematically admissible variations and the fulfillment of the Chetaev condition is generally incompatible with the standard commutation rule, unless a specific geometric condition - encoded through a skew-symmetric algebraic structure and the Lagrangian derivative of the constraints - is satisfied. Furthermore, this work extends the analysis to systems with multiple constraints introducing the concept of dynamic compensation. While Frobenius' Theorem provides a static criterion for integrability based on individual vector fields, our results suggest that dynamic consistency according to Chetaev's principle emerges as a collective phenomenon. We demonstrate that even when individual constraints are intrinsically non-integrable, their interactions can cancel out deviations from holonomy, maintaining global consistency. Notably, we show that for systems with high constraints this property is satisfied regardless of the constraints' form. These findings broaden the class of analyzable physical systems, suggesting that dynamic consistency is a resilient property that persists even in the absence of simple geometric integrability.</description>

      <title>Painleve solitons of AKNS system and irrational algebraic solitons of NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04498</link>

Abstract: A novel symmetry decomposition approach is introduced to derive the so-called ``Painleve solitons'' of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) system. These Painleve solitons propagate against a background governed by a Painleve transcendent, establishing a fundamental generalization of the well-known elliptic solitons concept. We demonstrate that while elliptic solitons arise from the combination of translation invariance and square eigenfunction symmetry, a different symmetry combination-scaling invariance, Galilean invariance, and square eigenfunction symmetry-generates ``Painleve IV solitons'' for the AKNS system. This discovery represents a significant theoretical advance in integrable systems theory. By selecting special solutions of the Painleve IV equation, we obtain explicit forms of several previously unknown classes of solutions for the AKNS system and the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation: irrational algebraic solitons, rational algebraic solitons, and parabolic cylindrical function solitons. These results dramatically expand the known solution landscape of one of the most important integrable models in mathematical physics, with broad implications for nonlinear wave phenomena across multiple physical disciplines including optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Mechanics of Macroscopic Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Electrodynamics in ponderable media remains defined by a century-long debate over force and energy localization. While the prevailing view treats competing formulations (Minkowski, Abraham, etc.) as equivalent conventions, this monograph argues that global conservation is insufficient for physical validity. A formulation must be mechanically coherent: power transfer must strictly equal the work rate of the force acting on the mass target.
  We formalize this requirement as the Force--Energy Consistency Criterion (FECC) -- a ``Kinematic Lock'' ($ P = \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{v} $) -- and use it to audit standard macroscopic tensors. The analysis demonstrates that only the Macroscopic Vacuum (Lorentz) Formulation offers a mechanically consistent description of total energy-momentum transfer. The internal distribution of this energy is shown to be macroscopically indeterminate.
  By reinterpreting spatial averaging as spectral filtering, we reconstruct the theory from the microscopic baseline. This perspective identifies a universal host interface that routes electromagnetic energy into mechanical work, heat, and reversible storage, revealing a structural isomorphism where thermodynamics, mechanics, and electrodynamics emerge as coupled spectral projections.</description>

      <title>Mechanically concealed holes</title>

Abstract: When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider this effect from a macroscopic continuum perspective down to atomistic scales. For this purpose, we focus on the basic continuum example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under compressive plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes simply by adjusting the thickness of the surrounding shells, with no need to change the materials. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic levels using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. These extensions attest the robustness of our predictions down to atomistic scales. Thus, they open a straightforward possibility to adjust the strategy of mechanical cloaking via atomistic manipulations. From both perspectives, the underlying concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</description>
