      <title>It Hears, It Sees too: Multi-Modal LLM for Depression Detection By Integrating Visual Understanding into Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally. In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.</description>

      <title>FINE: Factorized multimodal sentiment analysis via mutual INformation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis remains a challenging task due to the inherent heterogeneity across modalities. Such heterogeneity often manifests as asynchronous signals, imbalanced information between modalities, and interference from task-irrelevant noise, hindering the learning of robust and accurate sentiment representations. To address these issues, we propose a factorized multimodal fusion framework that first disentangles each modality into shared and unique representations, and then suppresses task-irrelevant noise within both to retain only sentiment-critical representations. This fine-grained decomposition improves representation quality by reducing redundancy, prompting cross-modal complementarity, and isolating task-relevant sentiment cues. Rather than manipulating the feature space directly, we adopt a mutual information-based optimization strategy to guide the factorization process in a more stable and principled manner. To further support feature extraction and long-term temporal modeling, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a Mixture of Q-Formers, placed before factorization, which precedes the factorization and uses learnable queries to extract fine-grained affective features from multiple modalities, and a Dynamic Contrastive Queue, placed after factorization, which stores latest high-level representations for contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture long-range discriminative patterns and improve class-level separability. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Pistachio: Towards Synthetic, Balanced, and Long-Form Video Anomaly Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scale, diversity, and complexity of Pistachio, revealing new challenges for existing methods and motivating future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding.</description>

      <title>Tracking and Segmenting Anything in Any Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking and segmentation play essential roles in video understanding, providing basic positional information and temporal association of objects within video sequences. Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training. SATA demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks, offering a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding.</description>

      <title>Field Test of 5G New Radio (NR) UL-MIMO and UL-256QAM for HD Live-Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of User-Generated Content (UGC), especially High-Definition (HD) live video streaming, places a significant demand on the uplink capabilities of mobile networks. To address this, the 5G New Radio (NR) standard introduced key uplink enhancements, including Uplink Multi-Input Multi-Output (UL-MIMO) and Uplink 256QAM, to improve throughput and spectral efficiency. However, while the benefits of these features for raw data rates are well-documented, their practical impact on real-time applications like live-streaming is not yet well understood. This paper investigates the performance of UL-MIMO and UL-256QAM for HD live-streaming over a commercial 5G network using the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). To ensure a fair assessment, we conduct a comparative analysis by modifying the modem firmware of commercial User Equipment (UE), allowing these features to be selectively enabled and disabled on the same device. Performance is evaluated based on key metrics, including dropped video frames and connection stability. Furthermore, this study analyzes 5G Radio Frequency (RF) parameters to quantify the spectral efficiency impact, specifically examining metrics derived from the Channel State Information (CSI) framework, including Reference Signal Received Power (CSI-RSRP), Reference Signal Received Quality (CSI-RSRQ), and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (CSI-SINR).</description>

      <title>Signal Processing for Haptic Surface Modeling: a Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Haptic feedback has been integrated into Virtual and Augmented Reality, complementing acoustic and visual information and contributing to an all-round immersive experience in multiple fields, spanning from the medical domain to entertainment and gaming. Haptic technologies involve complex cross-disciplinary research that encompasses sensing, data representation, interactive rendering, perception, and quality of experience. The standard processing pipeline, consists of (I) sensing physical features in the real world using a transducer, (II) modeling and storing the collected information in some digital format, (III) communicating the information, and finally, (IV) rendering the haptic information through appropriate devices, thus producing a user experience (V) perceptually close to the original physical world. Among these areas, sensing, rendering and perception have been deeply investigated and are the subject of different comprehensive surveys available in the literature. Differently, research dealing with haptic surface modeling and data representation still lacks a comprehensive dissection. In this work, we aim at providing an overview on modeling and representation of haptic surfaces from a signal processing perspective, covering the aspects that lie in between haptic information acquisition on one side and rendering and perception on the other side. We analyze, categorize, and compare research papers that address the haptic surface modeling and data representation, pointing out existing gaps and possible research directions.</description>

      <title>ExDDV: A New Dataset for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ever growing realism and quality of generated videos makes it increasingly harder for humans to spot deepfake content, who need to rely more and more on automatic deepfake detectors. However, deepfake detectors are also prone to errors, and their decisions are not explainable, leaving humans vulnerable to deepfake-based fraud and misinformation. To this end, we introduce ExDDV, the first dataset and benchmark for Explainable Deepfake Detection in Video. ExDDV comprises around 5.4K real and deepfake videos that are manually annotated with text descriptions (to explain the artifacts) and clicks (to point out the artifacts). We evaluate a number of vision-language models on ExDDV, performing experiments with various fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. Our results show that text and click supervision are both required to develop robust explainable models for deepfake videos, which are able to localize and describe the observed artifacts. Our novel dataset and code to reproduce the results are available at https://github.com/vladhondru25/ExDDV.</description>

      <title>A Visual Perception-Based Tunable Framework and Evaluation Benchmark for H.265/HEVC ROI Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ROI selective encryption, as an efficient privacy protection technique, encrypts only the key regions in the video, thereby ensuring security while minimizing the impact on coding efficiency. However, existing ROI-based video encryption methods suffer from insufficient flexibility and lack of a unified evaluation system. To address these issues, we propose a visual perception-based tunable framework and evaluation benchmark for H.265/HEVC ROI encryption. Our scheme introduces three key contributions: 1) A ROI region recognition module based on visual perception network is proposed to accurately identify the ROI region in videos. 2) A three-level tunable encryption strategy is implemented while balancing security and real-time performance. 3) A unified ROI encryption evaluation benchmark is developed to provide a standardized quantitative platform for subsequent research. This triple strategy provides new solution and significant unified performance evaluation methods for ROI selective encryption field. Experimental results indicate that the proposed benchmark can comprehensively measure the performance of the ROI selective encryption. Compared to existing ROI encryption algorithms, our proposed enhanced and advanced level encryption exhibit superior performance in multiple performance metrics. In general, the proposed framework effectively meets the privacy protection requirements in H.265/HEVC and provides a reliable solution for secure and efficient processing of sensitive video content.</description>

      <title>To Align or Not to Align: Strategic Multimodal Representation Alignment for Optimal Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12121v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning often relies on aligning representations across modalities to enable effective information integration, an approach traditionally assumed to be universally beneficial. However, prior research has primarily taken an observational approach, examining naturally occurring alignment in multimodal data and exploring its correlation with model performance, without systematically studying the direct effects of explicitly enforced alignment between representations of different modalities. In this work, we investigate how explicit alignment influences both model performance and representation alignment under different modality-specific information structures. Specifically, we introduce a controllable contrastive learning module that enables precise manipulation of alignment strength during training, allowing us to explore when explicit alignment improves or hinders performance. Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance.</description>
