      <title>Strange metals and planckian transport in a gapless phase from spatially random interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 'Strange' metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and Umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions such as large-$N$ limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a non-perturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals' key experimental signature of linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a 'planckian' transport scattering rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{tr} \sim k_B T/\hbar$ that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point, and instead arises from a phase of matter with gapless order parameter fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: a feature that is also observed in several experiments. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated electron materials.</description>

      <title>Scattering Theory of Chiral Edge Modes in Topological Magnon Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnon insulators exhibit robust edge modes with chiral properties similar to quantum Hall edge states. However, due to their strong localization at the edges, interactions between these chiral edge magnons can be significant, as we show in a model of coupled magnon-conserving spin chains in an electric field gradient. The chiral edge modes remain edge-localized and do not scatter into the bulk, and we characterize their scattering phase: for strongly-localized edge modes we observe significant deviation from the bare scattering phase. This renormalization of edge scattering can be attributed to bound bulk modes resonating with the chiral edge magnons, in the spirit of Feshbach resonances in atomic physics. We argue a real-time measurement protocol using spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy to study their scattering dynamics. Our result show that interaction among magnons can be encoded in an effective edge model of reduced dimensionality, where the interactions with the bulk renormalize the effective couplings. This work paves the way to develop a many-body effective theory for chiral edge magnons.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multi-layer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. We argue that a chiral spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of the chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion, i.e., the non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multi-layer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic degeneracy of ground state in the frustrated Heisenberg diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg diamond chain with ferro- and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions is studied. The phase boundary in the parametric space of these interactions is determined, where the transition between the ferromagnetic and other (singlet or ferrimagnetic) ground state phases occurs. On this phase boundary there is a dispersionless (flat) energy band in the one-magnon spectrum and these states can be represented as localized magnons in the trapping cells between neighboring diamonds. The ground state consists of the localized magnons and special magnon complexes and it is macroscopically degenerate. A remarkable feature of the model is the existence, on a certain part of the phase boundary, of two- and three-magnon localized states, forming flat bands in two- and three-magnon spectrum. All these localized states also belong to the ground state manifold, which turns out to be exactly the same as for the system of independent spins-$\frac{3}{2}$. This implies a large macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state $4^n$ ($n$ is number of diamonds in the chain) and a high residual entropy per spin $s_{0}=\frac{2}{3}\ln 2$.</description>

      <title>Four-Wave Mixing at peV Energy Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the non-linear magnetic susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$ of the disordered quantum Ising magnet, \lihofour, and demonstrate four-wave mixing due to coherent (anti-)Stokes Raman scattering at $\sim$ 100 Hz (p$e$V) energy scales. The temperature dependence of $\chi^{(3)}$ approximately follows a $\frac{1}{T}$ form, with a high-$T$ cutoff that can be linked to dissipation in the coherent spin clusters. $\chi^{(3)}$ also decreases monotonically with a transverse field, approaching a constant offset above a few kOe, suggesting the presence of both coherent, and spontaneous Raman scattering.</description>

      <title>Transport properties and Kohler's rule in $R$$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$B$_{12}$ solid solutions with $x$ $\leq$ 0.03: do charge stripes really exist in metallic dodecaborides?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonmagnetic metal LuB$_{12}$ is known to exhibit considerable transport anisotropy, which was explained in literature by different mechanisms including possible formation of dynamic charge stripes below the point $\sim$ 150K. Here we study transport properties of solid solutions based on LuB$_{12}$ host compound with general formula $R$$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$B$_{12}$ ($R$$-$Dy, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) and with $x$ $\leq$ 0.03. The experiment has been performed on single crystals of high quality in the temperature range 1.8 $-$ 300K in magnetic fields up to 82kOe. The application of several models to the analysis of zero-field resistivity is discussed. A phenomenological description of large positive quadratic component of transverse magnetoresistance $\Delta$$\rho$/$\rho$($H$) = $\mu_D^2$$H^2$, which dominates for all compounds under investigation, allows to estimate drift mobility exponential changes $\mu_D$ $\sim$ $T^{-\alpha}$ with the index $\alpha$ $\approx$ 0.95 $-$ 1.46. In order to check the existence of additional channel of scattering, caused by probable presence of dynamic charge stripes, we performed the study of the anisotropy of magnetoresistance in Dy$_{0.01}$Lu$_{0.99}$B$_{12}$ and Tm$_{0.03}$Lu$_{0.97}$B$_{12}$ compositions including the measurements of the field scans with different current and field geometries. The data obtained allow us to confirm the fulfillment of semi-empirical Kohler's rule in a wide interval of temperatures 30 $-$ 240K regardless of the orientation of current and magnetic field. This result was attributed as a proof of the absence of additional channel of scattering caused by stripes. We argue, that charge-transport anisotropy is originated in $R$$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$B$_{12}$ due to the anisotropy of electron-phonon scattering on the one hand and the effects of Fermi surface (FS) topology (at low temperatures) on the other.</description>

      <title>Effect of dynamical electron correlations on the tunnelling magnetoresistance of Fe/MgO/Fe(001) junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the non-equilibrium Green's function technique to investigate the steady-state transport properties of an Fe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), focusing on the impact of dynamical electron correlations on the Fe $3d$ orbitals. By applying the rigid shift approximation, we extend the calculations from zero- to finite-bias in a simple and computationally efficient manner, obtaining the bias-dependent electronic structure and current-versus-voltage characteristic curve in both the parallel and antiparallel configurations. In particular, we find that dynamical electron correlation manifests as a reduction in the spin splitting of the Fe $3d_{z^2}$ state compared to DFT predictions and introduces a finite relaxation time. The impact of these effects on the transport properties, however, varies significantly between magnetic configurations. In the parallel configuration, the characteristic curves obtained with DFT and DMFT are similar, as the transport is mostly due to the coherent transmission of spin-up electrons through the MgO barrier. Conversely, in the antiparallel configuration, correlation effects become more significant, with DMFT predicting a sharp current increase due to bias-driven inelastic electron-electron scattering. As a consequence, DMFT gives a lower bias threshold for the suppression of the tunneling magnetoresistance ratio compared to DFT, matching experimental data more closely.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in symmetry-breaking ordered phases of correlated fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking phases of many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions representing transient processes during which some characteristics of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Matching the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one consistently with nontrivial quantum dynamics is a long-standing, unresolved problem. We argue that the two-particle propagators may contain only even powers of the anomalous Green functions to make the thermodynamic system conserving. Only then can we continuously match the symmetry-breaking phase with the normal one at the transition point. We use the antiferromagnetic phase of a dynamical approximation to disclose universal features of the impact of quantum dynamics on thermodynamic and spectral properties of the ordered state.</description>

      <title>On the oxygen $p$ states in superconducting nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While key attention in transition-metal oxides is usually devoted to the $d$ states of the transition-metal ion, the O$(2p)$ states usually also carry important physics. We here examine these $p$ states in representatives of the novel superconducting nickelates, as described in realistic dynamical mean-field theory. Since the materials are located on the boundary between Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer systems, the role of oxygen is expectedly subtle. Strong reduction of doped holes on oxygen and first asymmetry effects are featured in infinite-layer nickelates. A pronounced nature of bridging $p_z$ orbitals is identified in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions at topological quantum criticality of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases at quantum criticality attract much attention recently. Here we numerically study the interaction-induced phase transitions at around the topological quantum critical points of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. This extended SSH model shows topological phase transitions between the topologically trivial and nontrivial critical phases when interaction is absent. So long as the interaction terms are turned on, the topologically nontrivial (trivial) critical phases are driven into topologically nontrivial (trivial) insulator phases with finite energy gaps. Particularly, we find the trivial insulator phase is further driven to the nontrivial insulator phase, through interaction-induced topological phase transition, although interaction generally is harmful to nontrivial topology. The stability of trivial insulator phase against interaction tends to vanish at the multicritical point that separates the trivial and nontrivial critical phases. Our work provides a concrete example for manifesting the impact of interaction on topological quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in a spin-1/2 square lattice $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$\delta$ altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key feature of the newly discovered altermagnet is that its spin degeneracy is lifted, although it has a antiferromagnetic order and zero net magnetization. In this work, we investigate a frustrated spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$\delta$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice by the tensor network method in combination with the linear spin-wave theory, with our focus on both the magnon excitations and longitudinal Higgs excitations. For a small $J_2$ and a finite range of $\delta$ we demonstrate that such a model hosts an altermagnetic ground state. Its magnon spectrum is split into two branches and the largest splitting occurs at $\left(\pm\pi/2, \pm\pi/2\right)$ in the Brillouin zone. The magnitudes of splitting in the two magnon modes are equal with respect to the case of $\delta=0$. Dynamical spin structure factors show that the splitting also occurs in the longitudinal Higgs modes, and the relative positions of the magnon modes and longitudinal Higgs modes in energy may change in the presence of a finite $\delta$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking from Monopole Condensation in QED$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QED in three dimensions with an $SU(2)_f$ doublet $\psi^i$ of massless, charge-1 Dirac fermions (and no Chern-Simons term) has a $U(2) = (SU(2)_f \times U(1)_m)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that acts on gauge-invariant local operators, including monopole operators charged under $U(1)_m$. We establish that there are only two possible IR scenarios: either the theory flows to a CFT with $U(2)$ symmetry (a scenario strongly constrained by conformal bootstrap bounds); or it spontaneously breaks $U(2) \to U(1)$ via the condensation of a monopole operator of smallest $U(1)_m$ charge, which is a $U(2)$ doublet. This leads to three Nambu-Goldstone bosons described by a sigma model into a squashed three-sphere $S^3$ with $U(2)$ isometry. We further show that the conventional $SU(2)_f$-triplet order parameter $i \bar \psi \vec \sigma \, \psi$ also gets a vev, exactly aligned with the monopole vev, such that the triplet parametrizes the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ base of the $S^3$ Hopf bundle, with the monopoles providing the $S^1$ fibers. We also recall why this scenario is compatible with the Vafa-Witten theorem. We obtain these results by analyzing the phase diagram as a function of the fermion triplet mass $\vec m$: we show that for all $\vec m \neq 0$ there is a Coulomb phase with only a weakly-coupled photon at low energies, arising from a monopole vev that is aligned with $\vec m$ via the Hopf map. We then argue that taking $\vec m \to 0$ leads to the symmetry-breaking scenario above. Throughout, we give a detailed account of anomaly matching, which leads to a $\theta=\pi$ term in the $S^3$ sigma model. In one presentation, it can be understood as a Hopf term in a suitably gauged version of the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization, magnetization, and superconductivity in bilayer graphene near the van Hove singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of Mott insulators and superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene has ignited intensive research into strong correlation effects in other stacking geometries. Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), when subjected to a perpendicular electric field, exhibits phase transitions to a variety of broken-symmetry states. Notably, superconductivity emerges when BBG is in proximity to a heavy transition-metal dichalcogenide, highlighting the role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we investigate the origin of Ising SOC and its role in the competition between superconductivity and spin- and valley-polarized states in BBG. Starting from strong electron-electron interactions on the BBG lattice, we derive a low-energy effective model near the valleys that incorporates both density-density and spin-spin interactions. Using self-consistent mean-field theory, we map out the BBG phase diagram. Our findings reveal that near the van Hove filling, a mixed spin- and valley-polarized phase dominates over superconductivity. Away from the van Hove filling, a spin-polarized, spin-triplet superconducting state arises, characterized by an in-plane orientation of the magnetic moment and an out-of-plane orientation of the d-vector. Contrary to previous proposals, we find that Ising SOC favours spin-valley order while suppressing superconductivity near the van Hove singularity. We discuss other potential proximity effects and suggest directions for future studies.</description>

Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. The volume of this separable ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the separable ball proposed in previous works, due to the large hierarchy of eigenvalues occurring in typical states. We further refine this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula, generalize it to characterize the separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criterion will help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability. We apply the procedure for separability detection on three-qubit X state in a dephasing environment, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Electric field driven spin textures in heavy fermion van der Waals magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered van der Waals material CeSiI exhibits both heavy fermion behavior and spiral order with strong magnetic anisotropy which makes it a potential host for topological spin textures such as skyrmions through electrical gating. A monolayer of CeSiI consists of two layers of Ce atoms on triangular lattices that sandwich a silicene layer. Motivated by the experiments, we explore magnetic phase diagram in van der Waals heavy fermion materials as a function of anisotropy and applied magnetic field using an effective spin model. We demonstrate that application of an external electric field can tune the Kondo coupling on each Ce layer differently, in turn allowing for controlling the intra- and interlayer magnetic couplings. Our analysis indicates that this fine-tuning leads to the coexistence of different magnetic orders in a single monolayer. In particular, we show that a novel vortex phase can be stabilized only in the presence of an external electric field. Our results highlight the unique advantages and the tunability of van der Waals heavy fermion materials for manipulation of chiral magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-free localization and efficient disorder averaging on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in the computational study of localization in quantum manybody systems is to capture the effects of rare events, which requires sampling over exponentially many disorder realizations. We implement an efficient procedure on a quantum processor, leveraging quantum parallelism, to efficiently sample over all disorder realizations. We observe localization without disorder in quantum many-body dynamics in one and two dimensions: perturbations do not diffuse even though both the generator of evolution and the initial states are fully translationally invariant. The disorder strength as well as its density can be readily tuned using the initial state. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our platform by measuring Renyi entropies. Our method could also be extended to higher moments of the physical observables and disorder learning.</description>

      <title>Ring-exchange physics in a chain of three-level ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of ring exchange interactions, bosons in a ladder-like lattice may form the bosonic analogon of a correlated metal, known as the d-wave Bose liquid (DBL). In this Letter, we show that a chain of trapped ions with three internal levels can be used to mimic a ladder-like system constrained to a maximum occupation of one boson per rung. The setup enables tunable ring exchange interactions, giving rise to a transition between a polarized regime with all bosons confined to one leg and the DBL regime. The latter state is characterized by a splitting of the peak in the momentum distribution and an oscillating pair correlation function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bose metals are metals made of Cooper pairs, which form at very low temperatures in superconducting films and Josephson junction arrays as an intermediate phase between superconductivity and superinsulation. We predicted the existence of this 2D metallic phase of bosons in the mid 90s, showing that they arise due to topological quantum effects. The observation of Bose metals in perfectly regular Josephson junction arrays fully confirms our original prediction and rules out alternative models based on disorder. Here, we review the basic mechanism leading to Bose metals. The key points are that the relevant vortices in granular superconductors are core-less, mobile XY vortices which can tunnel through the system due to quantum phase slips, that there is no charge-phase commutation relation preventing such vortices to be simultaneously out of condensate with charges, and that out-of-condensate charges and vortices are subject to topological mutual statistics interactions, a quantum effect that dominates at low temperatures. These repulsive mutual statistics interactions are sufficient to increase the energy of the Cooper pairs and lift them out of condensate. The result is a topological ground state in which charge conduction along edges and vortex movement across them organize themselves so as to generate the observed metallic saturation at low temperatures. This state is known today as a bosonic topological insulator.</description>

      <title>Low-rank decomposition on the antisymmetric product of geminals for strongly correlated electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated some variational methods to compute a wavefunction based on antisymmetric product of geminals (APG). The Waring decomposition on the APG wavefunction leads a finite sum of antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wavefunctions, each for which the variational principle can be applied. We call this as AGP-CI method which provides a variational solution of the APG wavefunction efficiently. However, number of AGP wavefunctions in the exact AGP-CI formalism become exponentially large in case of many-electron systems. Therefore, we also investigate the low-rank APG wavefunction, in which the geminal matrices are factorized by the Schur decomposition. Interestingly, only a few non-zero eigenvalues (up to half number of electrons) were found from the Schur decomposition on the APG wavefunction. We developed some methods to approximate the APG wavefunction by lowering the ranks of geminal matrices, and demonstrate their performance. Our new geminal method based on the low-rank decomposition can drastically reduce the number of variational parameters, although there is no efficient algorithm so far, due to some mathematical complications.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Meets Quantum Chaos: Anomalous Relaxation and Mpemba Crossings in Dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MPE), named after a student who discovered the phenomenon during a classroom experiment, has intrigued scientists for decades. This effect challenges conventional wisdom by demonstrating that the hot milk can freeze faster than cold milk under certain conditions. Recently, similar effects have been found in integrable quantum systems. However, the key distinction between the classical MPE and its quantum analog is that the latter relies predominantly on the of the properties of the initial states rather than the cooling rate. In this paper, we explore the quench dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) systems coupled to thermal baths. We investigate three scenarios--an SYK system coupled with an SYK thermal bath, an SYK system coupled with two thermal baths at different temperatures, and a dissipative SYK system modeled by the Lindblad equation. In the regimes where the system and the baths are strongly coupled, we observe effective temperature oscillations and Mpemba crossings (MPCs)--an effect of temperature crossings which are absent in the equilibrium thermodynamic analysis--when the system is strongly coupled to SYK thermal baths. The emergence of the MPCs suggests the observation of a transient MPE in the cooling or heating process before the systems reach the steady states. The emergence of MPCs in quantum chaotic systems exhibits strong parallels with the classical MPE.</description>

      <title>Kramers-Wannier self-duality and non-invertible translation symmetry in quantum chains: a wave-function perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of quantum caustics in the dynamics of interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have predicted the existence of caustics in many-body quantum dynamics, where they manifest as extended regions of enhanced probability density that obey temporal and spatial scaling relations. Focusing on the transverse-field Ising model, we investigate the dynamics initiated by a local quench in a spin chain, resulting in outward-propagating excitations that create a distinct caustic pattern. We calculate the scaling of the first two maxima of the interference fringes dressing the caustic, finding a universal exponent of 2/3, associated with an Airy function catastrophe. We demonstrate that this property is universal in the entire paramagnetic phase of the model, and starts varying at the quantum phase transition (QPT). This robust scaling persists even under perturbations that break the integrability of the model. We additionally explore the effect of boundary conditions and find that open boundaries introduce significant edge effects, leading to complex interference patterns. Despite these edge-induced dynamics, the overall power-law scaling exponent remains robust. These findings highlight the potential of quantum caustics as a powerful diagnostic tool for QPTs, demonstrating resilience against integrability-breaking perturbations and boundary condition variations.</description>

Abstract: The vacancy effect in quantum spin liquid (QSL) has been extensively studied. A finite density of random vacancies in the Kitaev model can lead to a pileup of low-energy density of states (DOS), which is generally experimentally determined by a scaling behavior of thermodynamic or magnetization quantities. Here, we report detailed muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) results of H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$, a Kitaev QSL candidate with vacancies. The absence of magnetic order is confirmed down to 80 mK, and the spin fluctuations are found to be persistent at low temperatures. Intriguingly, the time-field scaling law of longitudinal-field (LF)-$\mu$SR polarization is observed down to 0.1 K. This indicates a dynamical scaling, whose critical exponent 0.46 is excellently consistent with the scaling behavior of specific heat and magnetization data. All the observations point to the finite DOS with the form $N(E) \sim E^{-0.5}$ , which is expected for the Kitaev QSL in the presence of vacancies. Our {\mu}SR study provides a dynamical fingerprint of the power-law low-energy DOS, and introduces a crucial new insight into the vacancy effect in QSL.</description>

Abstract: The braiding of the worldlines of particles restricted to move on a network (graph) is governed by the graph braid group, which can be strikingly different from the standard braid group known from two-dimensional physics. It has been recently shown that imposing the compatibility of graph braiding with anyon fusion for anyons exchanging at a single wire junction leads to new types of anyon models with the braiding exchange operators stemming from solutions of certain generalised hexagon equations. In this work, we establish these graph-braided anyon fusion models for general wire networks. We show that the character of braiding strongly depends on the graph-theoretic connectivity of the given network. In particular, we prove that triconnected networks yield the same braiding exchange operators as the planar anyon models. In contrast, modular biconnected networks support independent braiding exchange operators in different modules. Consequently, such modular networks may lead to more efficient topological quantum computer circuits. Finally, we conjecture that the graph-braided anyon fusion models will possess the (generalised) coherence property where certain polygon equations determine the braiding exchange operators for an arbitrary number of anyons. We also extensively study solutions to these polygon equations for chosen low-rank multiplicity-free fusion rings, including the Ising theory, quantum double of Z2, and Tambara-Yamagami models. We find numerous solutions that do not appear in the planar theory of anyons.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets feature vanishing net magnetization, like antiferromagnets, but exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking and momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Motivated by the prevalence of altermagnetic materials with non-symmorphic symmetry-dictated band degeneracies, we provide realistic minimal models for altermagnetism by constructing tight-binding models for nonsymmorphic space groups with a sublattice defined by two magnetic atoms. These models can be applied to monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic materials and can describe d-wave, g-wave, and i-wave altermagnetism. By examining the altermagnetic susceptibility and mean field instabilities within a Hubbard model we reveal that these models have altermagnetic ground states and yield a Berry curvature that is linear in the spin-orbit coupling. We apply our models to RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, FeSb$_2$, $\kappa$-Cl, CrSb, and MnTe.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the pair-density-wave (PDW) state found in the one-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg chain, we report on a determinant quantum Monte Carlo DQMC study of pair-fields for a two-dimensional half-filled Hubbard layer coupled to an itinerant, non-interacting layer with one electron per site. In a specific range of interlayer hopping, the pairing vertex associated with PDW order becomes more attractive than that for uniform d-wave pairing, although both remain subdominant to the leading antiferromagnetic correlations at half-filling. Our result sheds light on where one potentially may find a PDW state in such a model.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method has proven to be an accurate and efficient numerical method for the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity problems. Whereas its application for imaginary-time calculations is much less competitive compared to well-established methods such as the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC). In this work, we unleash the full power of GTEMPO for zero-temperature imaginary-time calculations: the multi-time impurity state is time-translationally invariant with infinite boundary condition, therefore it can be represented as an infinite Grassmann matrix product state (GMPS) with nontrivial unit cell in a single time step, instead of an open boundary GMPS spanning the whole imaginary-time axis. We devise a very efficient infinite GTEMPO algorithm targeted at zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems, which is known to be a hard regime for quantum Monte Carlo methods. To demonstrate the performance of our method, we benchmark it against exact solutions in the noninteracting limit, and against CTQMC calculations in the Anderson impurity models with up to two orbitals, where we show that the required bond dimension of the infinite GMPS is much smaller than its finite-temperature counterpart.</description>

      <title>Solving quantum impurity problems on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The path integral formalism is the building block of many powerful numerical methods for quantum impurity problems. However, existing fermionic path integral based numerical calculations have only been performed in either the imaginary-time or the real-time axis, while the most generic scenario formulated on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour is left unexplored. In this work, we extended the recently developed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method to solve quantum impurity problems directly on the Kadanoff-Baym contour. The resulting method is numerically exact, with only two sources of numerical errors, e.g., the time discretization error and the matrix product state bond truncation error. The accuracy of this method is numerically demonstrated against exact solutions in the noninteracting case, and against existing calculations on the real- and imaginary-time axes for the single-orbital Anderson impurity model. We also show that the numerical errors of the method can be well suppressed as we refine the hyperparameters. Our method is a perfect benchmarking baseline for its alternatives which often employ less-controlled approximations, and can also be used as a real-time impurity solver in dynamical mean field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are one of the predominant quantum electronic states of matter where topology, symmetry, and Fermiology intertwine. This is pushed to a new limit by further invoking the coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom, which fundamentally affects the principal nature of the Cooper pair wave function. We investigate the onset of superconductivity in the Rashba-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice, which is symmetry-classified by the associated irreducible representations (irrep) of the hexagonal point group. From an instability analysis by means of the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TU-FRG) we find the $E_2$ irrep to dominate a large fraction of phase space and to lead up to an energetically preferred gapped, chiral superconducting state. The topological phase space classification associated with the anomalous propagators obtained from TU-FRG reveals a fragmentation of the $E_2$ domain into different topological sectors with vastly differing Chern numbers. It hints at a potentially applicable high sensitivity and tunability of chiral superconductors with respect to topological edge modes and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Ubiquity of the spin-orbit induced magnon nonreciprocity in ultrathin ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of magnons along a symmetry path may depend on the direction of propagation, similar to many other quasiparticles in nature. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as nonreciprocity. In addition to the fact that it is of great interest to understand the fundamental physical mechanism leading to this nonreciprocal propagation, the phenomenon of magnon nonreciprocity may be used to design magnon-based logic devices. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a significantly large spin-orbit coupling can lead to giant nonreciprocity of exchange-dominated terahertz magnons, when they are excited by means of spin-polarized electrons [Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\textbf{132},~126702~(2024)]. Here, by providing experimental results on two additional systems we demonstrate the generality of the observed phenomenon. Comparing the results of a Co/Ni bilayer on Ir(001) to those of a Co double layer on Ir(001) and W(110) we unravel the impact of the interfacial electronic hybridization on the observed phenomenon and provide further insights into the microscopic mechanism leading to this nonreciprocal magnon excitation. It was observed that the interfacial electronic hybridization is of some importance but is not crucial for the magnon nonreciprocity. This is an important observation since the electronic hybridization is known to be a key aspect in the determination of the magnetic properties at the interface. On the other hand the choice of the incident energy of the incoming electron beam is decisive for the observation of the effect. Our results indicate that depending on the energy of the incident electron beam and the scattering geometry the magnon nonreciprocity can be tuned and even be inverted for some ranges of the magnon momentum.</description>

Abstract: We report ferromagnetic ordering at $T_\mathrm {C}=1.3\,$K in the quasi-two dimensional magnet EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$ with large spins $S=7/2$. This ferromagnetic state was characterized by magnetization and specific heat measurements and the experimental results were compared with classical Monte Carlo simulations. They reveal a strong single ion anisotropy leading to an uniaxial spontaneous magnetization along the $c$ axis. Furthermore the application of a magnetic field in the hard magnetization plane $ab$ reduces the Curie temperature and it reaches zero temperature at a magnetic field of $\mu_\mathrm{0} H_c \approx 0.5\,$T.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Scalings of Quantum Entropies in Long-Range Heisenberg Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, building on state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we perform systematic finite-size scaling of both entanglement and participation entropies for long-range Heisenberg chain with unfrustrated power-law decaying interactions. We find distinctive scaling behaviors for both quantum entropies in the various regimes explored by tuning the decay exponent $\alpha$, thus capturing non-trivial features through logarithmic terms, beyond the case of linear Nambu-Goldstone modes. Our systematic analysis reveals that the quantum entanglement information, hidden in the scaling of the two studied entropies, can be obtained to the same level of order parameters and other usual finite-size observables of quantum many-body lattice models. The analysis and results obtained here can readily apply to more quantum criticalities in 1D and 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$: A Composite Fermion Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCIs) in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ has sparked significant interest in fractional topological matter without external magnetic fields. Unlike the flat dispersion of Landau levels, moir\'e electronic states are influenced by lattice effects within a nanometer-scale superlattice. This study examines the impact of these lattice effects on the topological phases in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, uncovering a family of FCIs with Abelian anyonic quasiparticles. Using a composite fermion approach, we identify a sequence of FCIs with fractional Hall conductivities $\sigma_{xy} = \frac{C}{2C + 1} \frac{e^2}{h}$ linked to partial filling $\nu_{\,\text{h}}$ of holes of the topmost moir\'e valence band. These states emerge from incompressible composite fermion bands of Chern number $C$ within a complex Hofstadter spectrum. This approach explains FCIs with Hall conductivities $\sigma_{xy} = (2/3) e^2/h$ and $\sigma_{xy} = (3/5) e^2/h$ at fractional fillings $\nu_{\,\text{h}} = 2/3$ and $\nu_{\,\text{h}} = 3/5$ observed in experiments, and uncovers other fractal FCI states. The Hofstadter spectrum reveals new phenomena, distinct from Landau levels, including a higher-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) at half-filling, leading to novel quantum phase transitions. This work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding FCIs in transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e systems and highlights mechanisms for topological quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Composite helical edges from Abelian fractional topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an interacting composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge state made of a regular helical liquid carrying charge $e$ and a (fractionalized) helical liquid carrying charge $e/n$. A systematic framework is developed for these composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge states with $n=1,2,3$. For $n=2$, the composite edge state consists of a regular helical Luttinger liquid and a fractional topological insulator (the Abelian $Z_4$ topological order) edge state arising from half-filled conjugated Chern bands. The composite edge state with $n=2$ is pertinent to the recent twisted MoTe$_2$ experiment, suggesting a possible fractional topological insulator with conductance $\frac{3}{2}\frac{e^2}{h}$ per edge. Using bosonization, we construct generic phase diagrams in the presence of $weak$ Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In addition to a phase of free bosons, we find a time-reversal symmetry-breaking localized insulator, two perfect positive drag phases, a perfect negative drag phase (for $n=2,3$), a time-reversal symmetric Anderson localization (only for $n=1$), and a disorder-dominated metallic phase analogous to the $\nu=2/3$ disordered fractional quantum Hall edges (only for $n=3$). We further compute the two-terminal edge-state conductance, the primary experimental characterization for the (fractional) topological insulator. Remarkably, the negative drag phase gives rise to an unusual edge-state conductance, $(1-1/n)\frac{e^2}{h}$, not directly associated with the filling factor. We further investigate the effect of an applied in-plane magnetic field. For $n&gt;1$, the applied magnetic field can result in a phase with edge-state conductance $\frac{1}{n}\frac{e^2}{h}$, providing another testable signature. Our work establishes a systematic understanding of the composite $(1+1/n)$ Abelian helical edge, paving the way for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP) calls for a minimal mechanism with no role for spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The long phonon mean-free-path leaves little room for scattering by point-like symmetry breaking defects. We argue that the angular dependence of the signal can be accounted for as a sum of two sinusoidal components each peaking when the magnetic field is parallel to a high symmetry axis. Anharmonicity and finite thermal expansion emerge as indispensable ingredients for a planar Hall signal. We identify the torque exerted by magnetic field on traveling electric dipolar waves as a possible microscopic driver.</description>

      <title>Proposal for bulk measurement of braid statistics in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasiparticles (QPs) or quasiholes (QHs) of fractional quantum Hall states have been predicted to obey fractional braid statistics, which refers to the Berry phase (in addition to the usual Aharonov-Bohm phase) associated with an exchange of two QPs or two QHs, or equivalently, to half of the phase associated with a QP/QH going around another. Certain phase slips in interference experiments in the fractional quantum Hall regime have been attributed to fractional braid statistics, where the interference probes the Berry phase associated with a closed path which has segments along the edges of the sample as well as through the bulk (where tunneling occurs). Noting that QPs / QHs with sharply quantized fractional charge and fractional statistics do not exist at the edge of a fractional quantum Hall state due to the absence of a gap there, we provide arguments that the existence of composite fermions at the edge is sufficient for understanding the primary experimental observations; composite fermions are known to occur in compressible states without a gap. We further propose that transport through a closed $\textit{tunneling}$ loop contained entirely in the bulk can, in principle, allow measurement of the braid statistics in a way that the braiding object explicitly has a fractionally quantized charge over the entire loop. Optimal parameters for this experimental geometry are determined from quantitative calculations.</description>

      <title>(SPT-)LSM theorems from projective non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projective symmetries are ubiquitous in quantum lattice models and can be leveraged to constrain their phase diagram and entanglement structure. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of projective algebras formed by non-invertible symmetries and lattice translations in a generalized $1+1$D quantum XY model based on group-valued qudits. This model is specified by a finite group $G$ and enjoys a projective $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ and translation symmetry, where symmetry operators obey a projective algebra in the presence of symmetry defects. For invertible symmetries, such projective algebras imply Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies. However, this is not generally true for non-invertible symmetries, and we derive a condition on $G$ for the existence of an LSM anomaly. When this condition is not met, we prove an SPT-LSM theorem: any unique and gapped ground state is necessarily a non-invertible weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) state with non-trivial entanglement, for which we construct an example fixed-point Hamiltonian. The projectivity also affects the dual symmetries after gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)\times Z(G)$ sub-symmetries, giving rise to non-Abelian and non-invertible dipole symmetries, as well as non-invertible translations. We complement our analysis with the SymTFT, where the projectivity causes it to be a topological order non-trivially enriched by translations. Throughout the paper, we develop techniques for gauging $\mathsf{Rep}(G)$ symmetry and inserting its symmetry defects on the lattice, which are applicable to other non-invertible symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically, and then benchmark both variants against exact diagonalization (ED) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two approaches strongly depends on details of the system.</description>

Abstract: The spiral spin liquid (SSL) is a highly degenerate state characterized by a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space spanned by a spiral propagation vector. Although the SSL state has been predicted in a number of various theoretical models, very few materials are so far experimentally identified to host such a state. Via combined single-crystal wide-angle and small-angle neutron scattering, we report observation of the SSL in the quasi-two-dimensional delafossite AgCrSe$_2$. We show that it is a very close realization of the ideal Heisenberg $J_1$--$J_2$--$J_3$ frustrated model on the triangular lattice. By supplementing our experimental results with microscopic spin-dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how such exotic magnetic states are driven by thermal fluctuations and exchange frustration.</description>

      <title>Novel Emergent Phases in a Two-Dimensional Superconductor</title>

Abstract: In this letter, we report our observation of an extraordinarily rich phase diagram of a LaScO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure. Close to the superconducting transition temperature, the system hosts a superconducting critical point of the Infinite-randomness type characterized by an effective dynamical exponent $\nu z$ that diverges logarithmically. At lower temperatures, we find the emergence of a magnetic field-tuned metallic phase that co-exists with a quantum Griffiths phase (QGP). Our study reveals a previously unobserved phenomenon in 2D superconductors -- an unanticipated suppression of the QGP below a crossover temperature in this system. This concealment is accompanied by the destruction of the superconducting quantum critical point signaled by a power-law divergence (in temperature) of the effective dynamical exponent. These observations are entirely at odds with the predictions of the infinite-randomness scenario and challenge the very concept of a vanishing energy scale associated with a quantum critical point. We develop and discuss possible scenarios like smearing of the phase transition that could plausibly explain our observations. Our findings challenge the notion that QGP is the ultimate ground state in two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Universality of Quantum Phase Transitions in the Integer and Fractional Quantum Hall Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) phases emerge due to strong electronic interactions and are characterized by anyonic quasiparticles, each distinguished by unique topological parameters, fractional charge, and statistics. In contrast, the integer quantum Hall (IQH) effects can be understood from the band topology of non-interacting electrons. We report a surprising super-universality of the critical behavior across all FQH and IQH transitions. Contrary to the anticipated state-dependent critical exponents, our findings reveal the same critical scaling exponent $\kappa = 0.41 \pm 0.02$ and localization length exponent $\gamma = 2.4 \pm 0.2$ for fractional and integer quantum Hall transitions. From these, we extract the value of the dynamical exponent $z\approx 1$. We have achieved this in ultra-high mobility trilayer graphene devices with a metallic screening layer close to the conduction channels. The observation of these global critical exponents across various quantum Hall phase transitions was masked in previous studies by significant sample-to-sample variation in the measured values of $\kappa$ in conventional semiconductor heterostructures, where long-range correlated disorder dominates. We show that the robust scaling exponents are valid in the limit of short-range disorder correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local measurements cannot create entanglement, but they can convert short-range entanglement to long-range entanglement, as in quantum teleportation. This phenomenon of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) has been widely discussed in recent work on measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and related phenomena. Here, we situate MIE in a broader context of the growth of long-range conditional mutual information (CMI) under decoherence. We upper-bound the rate at which decoherence can generate long-range CMI, and derive a characterization of states that saturate this bound. We point out that the structure of states saturating the CMI upper bound can be very different under different decoherent dynamics and provide explicit examples. We additionally explore the dynamics of CMI in random quantum circuits subject to random local decoherence, as a function of circuit depth. We argue that the universality class of the finite-depth teleportation transition, as well as its lower critical dimension, are different for erasures than for measurements.</description>

      <title>Characterizing MPS and PEPS Preparable via Measurement and Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing long-range entangled states poses significant challenges for near-term quantum devices. It is known that measurement and feedback (MF) can aid this task by allowing the preparation of certain paradigmatic long-range entangled states with only constant circuit depth. Here we systematically explore the structure of states that can be prepared using constant-depth local circuits and a single MF round. Using the framework of tensor networks, the preparability under MF translates to tensor symmetries. We detail the structure of matrix-product states (MPS) and projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) that can be prepared using MF, revealing the coexistence of Clifford-like properties and magic. In one dimension, we show that states with abelian symmetry protected topological order are a restricted class of MF-preparable states. In two dimensions, we parameterize a subset of states with abelian topological order that are MF-preparable. Finally, we discuss the analogous implementation of operators via MF, providing a structural theorem that connects to the well-known Clifford teleportation.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a type of phase transition in quantum many-body systems, which occurs in highly excited quantum many-body scar states, while most of the spectrum is largely unaffected. Such scar state phase transitions can be realized by embedding a matrix product state, known to undergo a phase transition, as a scar state into the thermal spectrum of a parent Hamiltonian. We find numerically that the mechanism for the scar state phase transition involves the formation or presence of low-entropy states at energies similar to the scar state in the vicinity of the phase transition point.</description>

      <title>Universal Role of Combined Symmetry for the Protection of the Dirac Cone in Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AF TIs) are predicted to exhibit exotic physical properties such as gigantic optical and topological magnetoelectric responses. While a key to achieving such phenomena relies on how to break the symmetry protecting the Dirac-cone surface state (SS) and acquire the mass of Dirac fermions, the mechanism has yet to be clarified. To address this issue, we carried out micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for GdBi hosting the type-II AF order, and uncovered the stripe-type 2$\times$1 reconstruction of the Fermi surface associated with the AF band folding. Intriguingly, in contrast to NdBi with the type-I AF order displaying the surface-selective Dirac-fermion mass, GdBi shows massless behavior irrespective of AF domains due to the robust topological protection. These results strongly suggest a crucial role of the ThetaTD (time-reversal and translational) symmetry to create the Dirac-fermion mass in AF TIs.</description>

      <title>Diffusive dynamics of fractionalized particles and the enhanced conductivity at the border of the neutral-ionic transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusive dynamics of the classical one-dimensional lattice model of mobile particles featuring the incoherent metallic state of the organic TTF-CA found in the vicinity of the neutral-ionic(NI)-transition. The particles are strongly correlated and feel the alternating site potentials, exhibiting uniform ionic (I) Mott insulating and neutral band insulating (N) phases when the Coulomb interaction and site potentials are large, respectively. We focus on the neutral-ionic domain walls (NIDW) activated by their competition, which is typically regarded as fractionalized particles. The finite temperature phase diagram reveals a thermodynamically stable NIDW phase not found in previous literature that emerges at the triple point, where the transition line splits into two first-order lines toward the critical endpoints. We analyze the long-time behavior of dynamics of the NIDWs and find that it captures the diffusive transport of the system. The conductivity derived from the diffusion constant and the number population of NIDWs shows a strong enhancement inside the NIDW phase, which can explain the large conductivity at the NI crossover found in TTF-CA.</description>

      <title>Drag conductance induced by neutral-mode localization in fractional quantum Hall junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A junction of two 2/3 fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edges, with no charge tunneling between them, may exhibit Anderson localization of neutral modes. Manifestations of such localization in transport properties of the junction are explored. There are two competing localization channels, ``neutral-mode superconductivity'' and ``neutral-mode backscattering''. Localization in any of these channels leads to an effective theory of the junction that is characteristic for FQH effect of bosons, with a minimal integer excitation charge equal to two, and with elementary quasiparticle charge equal to 2/3. These values can be measured by studying shot noise in tunneling experiments. Under the assumption of ballistic transport in the arms connecting the junction to contacts, the two-terminal conductance of the junction is found to be 4/3 for the former localization channel and 1/3 for the latter. The four-terminal conductance matrix reveals in this regime a strong quantized drag between the edges induced by neutral-mode localization. The two localization channels lead to opposite signs of the drag conductance, equal to $\pm 1/4$, which can also be interpreted as a special type of Andreev scattering. Coherent random tunneling in arms of the device (which are segments of 2/3 edges) leads to strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the conductance matrix. In the case of fully equilibrated arms, transport via the junction is insensitive to neutral-mode localization: The two-terminal conductance is quantized to 2/3 and the drag is absent.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Reduced Circuit Depths Using Trotter Error Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Product formulae are a popular class of digital quantum simulation algorithms due to their conceptual simplicity, low overhead, and performance which often exceeds theoretical expectations. Recently, Richardson extrapolation and polynomial interpolation have been proposed to mitigate the Trotter error incurred by use of these formulae. This work provides an improved, rigorous analysis of these techniques for the task of calculating time-evolved expectation values. We demonstrate that, to achieve error $\epsilon$ in a simulation of time $T$ using a $p^\text{th}$-order product formula with extrapolation, circuits depths of $O\left(T^{1+1/p} \textrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon)\right)$ are sufficient -- an exponential improvement in the precision over product formulae alone. Furthermore, we achieve commutator scaling, improve the complexity with $T$, and do not require fractional implementations of Trotter steps. Our results provide a more accurate characterisation of the algorithmic error mitigation techniques currently proposed to reduce Trotter error.</description>

Abstract: As for the study of Landau level wavefunctions for the quantum Hall effect, the magnetic Bloch wavefunctions based on the magnetic translation symmetry have been extensively investigated in the past few decades. In this article, the electric Floquet-Bloch wavefunctions based on the electric translation symmetry are studied as well as the momentum-frequency Brillouin zone, which is applied to the problem of one dimensional tight-binding model under an external electric field. The spectrum of electric Floquet-Bloch states can be generated by the projective representation of electric translation group, and the topological properties of these states are investigated.</description>

      <title>Observation of converse flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strong coupling between electric polarization and elastic deformation in solids is an important factor in creating useful electromechanical nanodevices. Such coupling is typically allowed in insulating materials with inversion symmetry breaking as exemplified by the piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric materials. Therefore, materials with metallicity and centrosymmetry have tended to be out of scope in this perspective. Here, we report the observation of giant elastic deformation by the application of an alternating electric current in topological semimetals (V,Mo)Te2, regardless of the centrosymmetry. Considering the crystal and band structures and the asymmetric measurement configurations in addition to the absence of the electromechanical effect in a trivial semimetal TiTe2, the observed effect is discussed in terms of a Berry-phase-derived converse flexoelectric effect in metals. The observation of the flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals paves a way for a new type of nanoscale electromechanical sensors and energy harvesting.</description>
