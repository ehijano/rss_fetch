      <title>Twistor Hecke eigensheaves in genus 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the strategy outlined in [DP09] arXiv:math/0604617 and [DP22] arXiv:math/0604617 for bundles of rank 2 on a smooth projective curve of genus $2$, we construct flat connections over the moduli of stable bundles, with singularities along the wobbly locus. We verify that the associated $D$-modules are Hecke eigensheaves. The local systems are constructed by the nonabelian Hodge correspondence from Higgs bundles. The spectral varieties of the Higgs bundles are the Hitchin fibers corresponding to the Hecke eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Orbifold theta functions and mid-age invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the orbifold approach to study theta functions in intrinsic mirror symmetry. We introduce a new type of orbifold invariants for snc pairs, called mid-age invariants, and use these invariants to define orbifold invariants associated with the broken line type. Then, we define the orbifold theta functions as generating functions of orbifold invariants with mid-ages. We show that these orbifold theta functions are well-defined and satisfy the multiplication rule.</description>

      <title>Monodromy groups of indecomposable coverings of bounded genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each nonnegative integer $g$, we classify the ramification types and monodromy groups of indecomposable coverings of complex curves $f: X\to Y$ where $X$ has genus $g$, under the hypothesis that $n:=\deg(f)$ is sufficiently large and the monodromy group is not $A_n$ or $S_n$. This proves a conjecture of Guralnick and several conjectures of Guralnick and Shareshian.</description>

Abstract: The combination of this paper and its companion complete the classification of monodromy groups of indecomposable coverings of complex curves $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb P^1$ of sufficiently large degree in comparison to the genus of $X$.

      <description>arXiv:2403.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth projective variety $X$ and a smooth nef divisor $D$, we identify genus zero relative Gromov--Witten invariants of $(X,D)$ with $(n+1)$ relative markings with genus zero relative/orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants of a $\mathbb P^1$-bundle $P:=\mathbb P(\mathcal O_X(-D)\oplus \mathcal O_X)$ with $n$ relative markings. This is a generalization of the local-relative correspondence beyond maximal contacts. Repeating this process, we identify genus zero relative Gromov--Witten invariants with genus zero absolute Gromov--Witten invariants of toric bundles. We also present how this correspondence can be used to compute genus zero two-point relative Gromov--Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Moduli of codimension two linear sections of subadjoint varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group of type $F_{4}$, $E_{6}$, $E_{7}$ or $E_{8}$, and let $\mathfrak{g}$ be its Lie algebra. The adjoint variety $X_{ad} \subseteq \mathbb{P} \mathfrak{g}$ is defined as the unique closed orbit of the adjoint action of $G$ on $\mathbb{P}\mathfrak{g}$. $X_{ad}$ is a Fano contact manifold covered by lines in $\mathbb{P} \mathfrak{g}$. The subadjoint variety $S \subseteq \mathbb{P} W$ is denoted by the variety of lines on $X_{ad}$ through a fixed point $x$, where $W \subseteq T_{x}X$ is taken as the contact hyperplane. It follows from a result in representation theory of Vinberg that the GIT quotient space of codimension two linear sections of $S$ is isomorphic to the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(1,3,4,6)$. In this note, we investigate the problem of finding a geometric interpretation of the above isomorphism. As a main result, for each $\mathfrak{g}$ of the above type, we construct a natural open embedding of the GIT quotient space of nonsingular codimension two linear sections of $S$ into $\mathbb{P}(1,3,4,6)$ whose complement is a fixed hypersurface of degree 12. The key ingredient of our construction is to apply a correspondence of Bahargava and Ho which relates the above moduli problem to a moduli problem on curves of genus one.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for moduli space of genus two curves and an application to post-quantum cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use machine learning to study the locus ${\mathcal L}_n$ of genus two curves with $(n, n)$-split Jacobian. More precisely we design a transformer model which given values for the Igusa invariants determines if the corresponding genus two curve is in the locus ${\mathcal L}_n$, for $n=2, 3, 5, 7$. Such curves are important in isogeny based cryptography.
  During this study we discover that there are no rational points ${\mathfrak p} \in {\mathcal L}_n$ with weighted moduli height $\leq 2$ in any of ${\mathcal L}_2$, ${\mathcal L}_3$, and ${\mathcal L}_5$. This extends on previous work of the authors to use machine learning methods to study the moduli space of genus 2 algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>Birational complexity and conic fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,B)$ be a log Calabi--Yau pair of dimension $n$, index one, and birational complexity $c$. We show that $(X,B)$ has a crepant birational model that admits a tower of Mori fiber spaces of which at least $n-c$ are conic fibrations. Motivated by the proof of the previous statement, we introduce new measures of the complexity of a log Calabi--Yau pair; the alteration complexity and the conic complexity. We characterize when these invariants are zero. Finally, we give applications of the tools of the main theorem to birational superrigidity, Fano hypersurfaces, dual complexes, Weil indices of Fano varieties, and klt singularities.</description>

      <title>Tian's stabilization problem for toric Fanos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1988, Tian posed the stabilization problem for equivariant global log canonical thresholds. We solve it in the case of toric Fano manifolds. This is the first general result on Tian's problem. A key new estimate involves expressing complex singularity exponents associated to orbits of a group action in terms of support and gauge functions from convex geometry. These techniques also yield a resolution of another conjecture of Tian from 2012 on more general thresholds associated to Grassmannians of plurianticanonical series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field. In this paper we study the Abhyankar-Sathaye Epimorphism Conjecture for certain hyperplanes in $\A_k^4$ defined by a polynomial of the form $a(X)Y-F(X,Z,T)$. When $k=\bC$, Kaliman, V\'{e}n\'{e}reau and Zaidenberg have proved that such hyperplanes are rectifiable in $\A^4_{\bC}$. We extend their result over any field of characteristic zero and when $k$ is a field of arbitrary characteristic we prove the Abhyankar-Sathaye Conjecture for such hyperplanes under some conditions on the roots of $a(X)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic computations of tropical refined invariants in genus 0 and 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Block and G\"ottsche introduced a Laurent polynomial multiplicity to count tropical curves. Itenberg and Mikhalkin then showed that this multiplicity leads to invariant counts called tropical refined invariants. Recently, Brugall\'e and Jaramillo-Puentes studied the polynomiality properties of the coefficients of these invariants and showed that for fixed genus g, the coefficients ultimately coincide with polynomials in the homology class of the curves we look at. We call the generating series of these polynomials asymptotic refined invariant. In genus 0, the asymptotic refined invariant has been computed by the second author in the h-transverse case.
  In this paper, we give a new proof of the formula for the asymptotic refined invariant for g = 0 using variations on the floor diagram algorithm. This technique allows also to compute the asymptotic refined invariant for g = 1. The result exhibits surprising regularity properties related to the generating series of partition numbers and quasi-modular forms.</description>

      <title>Syzygy Theoretic Approach to Horrocks-type Criteria for Vector Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a variant of Horrocks criteria for vector bundles mainly through a syzygy theoretic approach. In this spirit we begin with describing various proofs of the splitting criteria for ACM and Buchsbaum bundles, giving new sights of the structure theorem. Our main result gives a structure theorem of quasi-Buchsbaum bundles on ${\mathbb P}^n$, which characterizes the null-correlation bundle. Also, the quasi-Buchsbaum bundles on ${\mathbb P}^3$ with simple cohomologies are classified in terms of standard system of parameters.</description>

      <title>A Wall Crossing Formula for Motivic Enumerative Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an analog of the wall crossing formula for Welschinger invariants relating the difference of signed curve counting of real curves passing through configurations that differ by a pair of complex conjugated points, and a correspondence Welschinger invariant of the blow up.
  We prove this analogue for the motivic count of rational curves of fixed degree passing through a generic configuration of points, counted with a motivic multiplicity in the Grothendieck-Witt ring of a base field, extending the notions in the correspondence theorem between motivic invariants for $k$-rational point conditions and tropical curves.
  We use this formula to compute the degree 4 motivic enumerative invariants of the projective plane counting curves passing through configurations of points defined over quadratic extensions of a base field.</description>

      <title>Weighted Ehrhart theory via mixed Hodge modules on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a cohomological and geometrical interpretation for the weighted Ehrhart theory of a full-dimensional lattice polytope $P$, with Laurent polynomial weights of geometric origin. For this purpose, we calculate the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch characteristic classes of a mixed Hodge module complex $\mathcal{M}$ whose underlying cohomology sheaves are constant on the $\mathbb{T}$-orbits of the toric variety $X_P$ associated to $P$. Besides motivic coefficients, this also applies to the intersection cohomology Hodge module. We introduce a corresponding generalized Hodge $\chi_y$-polynomial of the ample divisor $D_P$ on $X_P$. Motivic properties of these characteristic classes are used to express this Hodge polynomial in terms of a very general weighed lattice point counting and the corresponding weighted Ehrhart theory. We introduce, for such a mixed Hodge modules complex $\mathcal{M}$ on $X$, an Ehrhart polynomial $E_{P,\mathcal{M}}$ generalizing the Hodge polynomial of $\mathcal{M}$ and satisfying a reciprocity formula and a purity formula fitting with the duality for mixed Hodge modules. This Ehrhart polynomial and its properties depend only on a Laurent polynomial weight function on the faces $Q$ of $P$. In the special case of the intersection cohomology mixed Hodge module, the weight function corresponds to Stanley's $g$-function of the polar polytope of $P$, hence it depends only on the combinatorics of $P$. In particular, we obtain a combinatorial formula for the intersection cohomology signature.</description>

      <title>On a combinatorial classification of fine compactified universal Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the definition of $V$-stability conditions, given by Viviani in a recent preprint, we introduce the notion of \emph{universal stability conditions}. Building on results by Pagani and Tommasi, we show that fine compactified universal Jacobians, that is, fine compactified Jacobians over the moduli spaces of stable pointed curves $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$, are combinatorially classified by universal stability conditions.
  We use these stability conditions to show the following. The inclusion of fine compactified universal Jacobians of type $(g,n)$ whose fibres over geometric points are classical, that is, they are constructed by some numerical polarisation, into the class of all fine compactified universal Jacobians, is strict, in general, for any $g\geq 2$. This answers a question of Pagani and Tommasi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study higher spin (pure and mixed spin) representations of the Yangian of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We provide a geometric realization in terms of the critical cohomology of representations of the quiver with potential of Bykov and Zinn-Justin [BZJ20]. When the framing dimension is 1, it recovers the evaluation pullback of the $\ell+1$-dimensional irreducible representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We introduce the lattice model and prove that its partition function coincides with the weight function constructed using the framed shuffle formula. The latter follows the approach of Rim\'anyi, Tarasov and Varchenko [RTV15].</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ and $f$ be a homogeneous polynomial. We provide an explicit algorithm, which, given the invariants of a generic $f$ under the action of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ returns a polynomial in the orbit of $f$. We derive a specific algorithm for the reconstruction of a generic non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 4 from its invariants, as well as a direct reconstruction algorithm for generic non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 3 from their Dixmier-Ohno invariants.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an $n\times n$ system of ODEs on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with a simple pole $A$ at $z=0$ and a double pole $u={\rm diag}(u_1, \dots, u_n)$ at $z=\infty$. This is the simplest situation in which the monodromy data of the system are described by upper and lower triangular Stokes matrices $S_\pm$, and we impose reality conditions which imply $S_-=S_+^\dagger$. We study leading WKB exponents of Stokes matrices in parametrizations given by generalized minors and by spectral coordinates, and we show that for $u$ on the caterpillar line (which corresponds to the limit $(u_{j+1}-u_j)/(u_j- u_{j-1}) \to \infty$ for $j=2, \cdots, n-1$), the real parts of these exponents are given by periods of certain cycles on the degenerate spectral curve $\Gamma(u_{\rm cat}(t), A)$.
  These cycles admit unique deformations for $u$ near the caterpillar line. Using the spectral network theory, we give for $n=2$, and $n=3$ exact WKB predictions for asymptotics of generalized minors in terms of periods of these cycles. Boalch's theorem from Poisson geometry implies that real parts of leading WKB exponents satisfy the rhombus (or interlacing) inequalities. We show that these inequalities are in correspondence with finite webs of the canonical foliation on the root curve $\Gamma^r(u, A)$, and that they follow from the positivity of the corresponding periods. We conjecture that a similar mechanism applies for $n&gt;3$.
  We also outline the relation of the spectral coordinates with the cluster structures considered by Goncharov-Shen, and with ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum field theories in dimension four associated with some simple quivers.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten invariants, Ramanujan's continued fractions, and cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture a structure formula for the $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten partition function for surfaces with holomorphic 2-form. The conjecture is based on $S$-duality and a structure formula for the vertical contribution previously derived by the third-named author using Gholampour-Thomas's theory of virtual degeneracy loci.
  For ranks $r=2,3$, conjectural expressions for the partition function in terms of the theta functions of $A_{r-1}, A_{r-1}^{\vee}$ and Seiberg-Witten invariants were known. We conjecture new expressions for $r=4,5$ in terms of the theta functions of $A_{r-1}, A_{r-1}^{\vee}$, Seiberg-Witten invariants, and continued fractions studied by Ramanujan. The vertical part of our conjectures is proved for low virtual dimensions by calculations on nested Hilbert schemes.
  The horizontal part of our conjectures gives predictions for virtual Euler characteristics of Gieseker-Maruyama moduli spaces of stable sheaves. In this case, our formulae are sums of universal functions with coefficients in Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. The universal functions, corresponding to different quantum vacua, are permuted under the action of the Galois group.
  For $r=6, 7$ we also find relations with Hauptmoduln of $\Gamma_0(r)$. We present $K$-theoretic refinements for $r=2,3,4$ involving weak Jacobi forms.</description>

      <title>Tropical curves in abelian surfaces III: pearl diagrams and multiple cover formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the third installment in a series of papers devoted to the computation of enumerative invariants of abelian surfaces through the tropical approach. We develop a pearl diagram algorithm similar to the floor diagram algorithm used in toric surfaces that concretely solves the tropical problem.
  These diagrams can be used to prove specific cases of Oberdieck's multiple cover formula that reduce the computation of invariants for non-primitive classes to the primitive case, getting rid of all diagram considerations and providing short explicit formulas. The latter can be used to prove the quasi-modularity of generating series of classical invariants, and the polynomiality of coefficients of fixed codegree in the refined invariants.</description>

      <title>Quotient singularities in the Grothendieck ring of varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, $X$ be a smooth complex projective variety with a faithful $G$-action, and $Y$ be a resolution of singularities of $X/G$. Larsen and Lunts asked whether $[X/G]-[Y]$ is divisible by $[\mathbb{A}^1]$ in the Grothendieck ring of varieties. We show that the answer is negative if $BG$ is not stably rational and affirmative if $G$ is abelian. The case when $X=Z^n$ for some smooth projective variety $Z$ and $G=S_n$ acts by permutation of the factors is of particular interest. We make progress on it by showing that $[Z^n/S_n]-[Z\langle n\rangle / S_n]$ is divisible by $[\mathbb{A}^1]$, where $Z\langle n\rangle$ is Ulyanov's polydiagonal compactification of the $n$-th configuration space of $Z$.</description>

      <title>The proper Landau--Ginzburg potential, intrinsic mirror symmetry and the relative mirror map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth log Calabi--Yau pair $(X,D)$, we use the intrinsic mirror symmetry construction to define the mirror proper Landau--Ginzburg potential and show that it is a generating function of two-point relative Gromov--Witten invariants of $(X,D)$. We compute certain relative invariants with several negative contact orders, and then apply the relative mirror theorem of \cite{FTY} to compute two-point relative invariants. When $D$ is nef, we compute the proper Landau--Ginzburg potential and show that it is the inverse of the relative mirror map. Specializing to the case of a toric variety $X$, this implies the conjecture of \cite{GRZ} that the proper Landau--Ginzburg potential is the open mirror map. When $X$ is a Fano variety, the proper potential is related to the anti-derivative of the regularized quantum period.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a projective variety with an int-amplified endomorphism of degree invertible in the base field satisfies Bott vanishing. This is a new way to analyze which varieties have nontrivial endomorphisms. In particular, we extend some classification results on varieties admitting endomorphisms (for Fano threefolds of Picard number one and several other cases) to any characteristic. The classification results in characteristic zero are due to Amerik-Rovinsky-Van de Ven, Hwang-Mok, Paranjape-Srinivas, Beauville, and Shao-Zhong. Our method also bounds the degree of morphisms into a given variety. Finally, we relate endomorphisms to global $F$-regularity.</description>

Abstract: We complete the classification of the real forms of almost homogeneous SL$_2$-threefolds. More precisely, we use the Luna-Vust theory to determine the real forms of minimal smooth complete SL$_2$-varieties containing an orbit isomorphic to SL$_2/H$, where $H$ is a finite cyclic subgroup of SL$_2$. Moreover, we study the rationality and the set of real points of those varieties.</description>

      <title>Detecting affine equivalences between certain types of parametric curves, in any dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two curves are affinely equivalent if there exists an affine mapping transforming one of them onto the other. Thus, detecting affine equivalence comprises, as important particular cases, similarity, congruence and symmetry detection. In this paper we generalize previous results by the authors to provide an algorithm for computing the affine equivalences between two parametric curves of certain types, in any dimension. In more detail, the algorithm is valid for rational curves, and for parametric curves with non-rational but meromorphic components admitting a rational inverse. Unlike other algorithms already known for rational curves, the algorithm completely avoids polynomial system solving, and uses bivariate factoring, instead, as a fundamental tool. The algorithm has been implemented in the computer algebra system {\tt Maple}, and can be freely downloaded and used.</description>

Abstract: We study conjectures of Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh that categorify the relationship between automorphic periods and $L$-functions in the context of the Geometric Langlands equivalence. We provide evidence for these conjectures in some low-rank examples, by using derived Fourier analysis and the theory of chiral algebras to categorify the Rankin-Selberg unfolding method.</description>

      <title>Tensor decompositions with applications to LU and SLOCC equivalence of multipartite pure states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a broad lemma, one consequence of which is the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) of tensors defined by DeLathauwer, DeMoor and Vandewalle (2000). By an analogous application of the lemma, we find a complex orthogonal version of the HOSVD. Kraus' (2010) algorithm used the HOSVD to compute normal forms of almost all $n$-qubit pure states under the action of the local unitary group. Taking advantage of the double cover $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \times \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \operatorname{SO}_4({\mathbb{C}})$, we produce similar algorithms (distinguished by the parity of $n$) that compute normal forms for almost all $n$-qubit pure states under the action of the SLOCC group.</description>
