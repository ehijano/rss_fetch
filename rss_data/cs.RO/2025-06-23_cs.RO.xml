      <title>Reflective VLM Planning for Dual-Arm Desktop Cleaning: Bridging Open-Vocabulary Perception and Precise Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Desktop cleaning demands open-vocabulary recognition and precise manipulation for heterogeneous debris. We propose a hierarchical framework integrating reflective Vision-Language Model (VLM) planning with dual-arm execution via structured scene representation. Grounded-SAM2 facilitates open-vocabulary detection, while a memory-augmented VLM generates, critiques, and revises manipulation sequences. These sequences are converted into parametric trajectories for five primitives executed by coordinated Franka arms. Evaluated in simulated scenarios, our system achieving 87.2% task completion, a 28.8% improvement over static VLM and 36.2% over single-arm baselines. Structured memory integration proves crucial for robust, generalizable manipulation while maintaining real-time control performance.</description>

      <title>A workflow for generating synthetic LiDAR datasets in simulation environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simulation workflow for generating synthetic LiDAR datasets to support autonomous vehicle perception, robotics research, and sensor security analysis. Leveraging the CoppeliaSim simulation environment and its Python API, we integrate time-of-flight LiDAR, image sensors, and two dimensional scanners onto a simulated vehicle platform operating within an urban scenario. The workflow automates data capture, storage, and annotation across multiple formats (PCD, PLY, CSV), producing synchronized multimodal datasets with ground truth pose information. We validate the pipeline by generating large-scale point clouds and corresponding RGB and depth imagery. The study examines potential security vulnerabilities in LiDAR data, such as adversarial point injection and spoofing attacks, and demonstrates how synthetic datasets can facilitate the evaluation of defense strategies. Finally, limitations related to environmental realism, sensor noise modeling, and computational scalability are discussed, and future research directions, such as incorporating weather effects, real-world terrain models, and advanced scanner configurations, are proposed. The workflow provides a versatile, reproducible framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic LiDAR datasets to advance perception research and strengthen sensor security in autonomous systems. Documentation and examples accompany this framework; samples of animated cloud returns and image sensor data can be found at this Link.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Model Optimization via Differentiable Contact Manifold for In-Space Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation in space is essential for emerging applications such as debris removal and in-space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing (ISAM). A key requirement for these tasks is the ability to perform precise, contact-rich manipulation under significant uncertainty. In particular, thermal-induced deformation of manipulator links and temperature-dependent encoder bias introduce kinematic parameter errors that significantly degrade end-effector accuracy. Traditional calibration techniques rely on external sensors or dedicated calibration procedures, which can be infeasible or risky in dynamic, space-based operational scenarios.
  This paper proposes a novel method for kinematic parameter estimation that only requires encoder measurements and binary contact detection. The approach focuses on estimating link thermal deformation strain and joint encoder biases by leveraging information of the contact manifold - the set of relative SE(3) poses at which contact between the manipulator and environment occurs. We present two core contributions: (1) a differentiable, learning-based model of the contact manifold, and (2) an optimization-based algorithm for estimating kinematic parameters from encoder measurements at contact instances. By enabling parameter estimation using only encoder measurements and contact detection, this method provides a robust, interpretable, and data-efficient solution for safe and accurate manipulation in the challenging conditions of space.</description>

      <title>General-Purpose Robotic Navigation via LVLM-Orchestrated Perception, Reasoning, and Acting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation, and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed input representations, or pre-existing maps.</description>

      <title>DiLQR: Differentiable Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator via Implicit Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While differentiable control has emerged as a powerful paradigm combining model-free flexibility with model-based efficiency, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) remains underexplored as a differentiable component. The scalability of differentiating through extended iterations and horizons poses significant challenges, hindering iLQR from being an effective differentiable controller. This paper introduces DiLQR, a framework that facilitates differentiation through iLQR, allowing it to serve as a trainable and differentiable module, either as or within a neural network. A novel aspect of this framework is the analytical solution that it provides for the gradient of an iLQR controller through implicit differentiation, which ensures a constant backward cost regardless of iteration, while producing an accurate gradient. We evaluate our framework on imitation tasks on famous control benchmarks. Our analytical method demonstrates superior computational performance, achieving up to 128x speedup and a minimum of 21x speedup compared to automatic differentiation. Our method also demonstrates superior learning performance ($10^6$x) compared to traditional neural network policies and better model loss with differentiable controllers that lack exact analytical gradients. Furthermore, we integrate our module into a larger network with visual inputs to demonstrate the capacity of our method for high-dimensional, fully end-to-end tasks.

      <title>Distilling On-device Language Models for Robot Planning with Minimal Human Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We release all software, trained models, and datasets at https://zacravichandran.github.io/PRISM.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptation for Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an accurate dynamics model. A video showcasing our framework and the physical experiments is available here: https://youtu.be/9QX1Q5Ut9Rs</description>

      <title>EASE: Embodied Active Event Perception via Self-Supervised Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and summarize events in real time, is essential for embodied intelligence in tasks such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces, annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.</description>

      <title>Risk-Guided Diffusion: Toward Deploying Robot Foundation Models in Space, Where Failure Is Not An Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe, reliable navigation in extreme, unfamiliar terrain is required for future robotic space exploration missions. Recent generative-AI methods learn semantically aware navigation policies from large, cross-embodiment datasets, but offer limited safety guarantees. Inspired by human cognitive science, we propose a risk-guided diffusion framework that fuses a fast, learned "System-1" with a slow, physics-based "System-2", sharing computation at both training and inference to couple adaptability with formal safety. Hardware experiments conducted at the NASA JPL's Mars-analog facility, Mars Yard, show that our approach reduces failure rates by up to $4\times$ while matching the goal-reaching performance of learning-based robotic models by leveraging inference-time compute without any additional training.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning for Active Neck Motion Enabling Robot Manipulation beyond the Field of View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most prior research in deep imitation learning has predominantly utilized fixed cameras for image input, which constrains task performance to the predefined field of view. However, enabling a robot to actively maneuver its neck can significantly expand the scope of imitation learning to encompass a wider variety of tasks and expressive actions such as neck gestures. To facilitate imitation learning in robots capable of neck movement while simultaneously performing object manipulation, we propose a teaching system that systematically collects datasets incorporating neck movements while minimizing discomfort caused by dynamic viewpoints during teleoperation. In addition, we present a novel network model for learning manipulation tasks including active neck motion. Experimental results showed that our model can achieve a high success rate of around 90\%, regardless of the distraction from the viewpoint variations by active neck motion. Moreover, the proposed model proved particularly effective in challenging scenarios, such as when objects were situated at the periphery or beyond the standard field of view, where traditional models struggled. The proposed approach contributes to the efficiency of dataset collection and extends the applicability of imitation learning to more complex and dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>RLRC: Reinforcement Learning-based Recovery for Compressed Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we begin by conducting an extensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of model compression techniques when applied to VLAs. Building on the insights gained from these preliminary experiments, we propose RLRC, a three-stage recovery method for compressed VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL, and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines, demonstrating strong potential for on-device deployment of VLAs.

      <title>Optimizing Exploration with a New Uncertainty Framework for Active SLAM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of the environment is a central goal of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems. However, the agent's trajectory can significantly affect estimation accuracy. This paper presents a new method to model map uncertainty in Active SLAM systems using an Uncertainty Map (UM). The UM uses probability distributions to capture where the map is uncertain, allowing Uncertainty Frontiers (UF) to be defined as key exploration-exploitation objectives and potential stopping criteria. In addition, the method introduces the Signed Relative Entropy (SiREn), based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, to measure both coverage and uncertainty together. This helps balance exploration and exploitation through an easy-to-understand parameter. Unlike methods that depend on particular SLAM setups, the proposed approach is compatible with different types of sensors, such as cameras, LiDARs, and multi-sensor fusion. It also addresses common problems in exploration planning and stopping conditions. Furthermore, integrating this map modeling approach with a UF-based planning system enables the agent to autonomously explore open spaces, a behavior not previously observed in the Active SLAM literature. Code and implementation details are available as a ROS node, and all generated data are openly available for public use, facilitating broader adoption and validation of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>RoboMonkey: Scaling Test-Time Sampling and Verification for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment, RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution, and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25% absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.</description>

      <title>Learning to Dock: A Simulation-based Study on Closing the Sim2Real Gap in Autonomous Underwater Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking in dynamic and uncertain environments is a critical challenge for underwater robotics. Reinforcement learning is a promising method for developing robust controllers, but the disparity between training simulations and the real world, or the sim2real gap, often leads to a significant deterioration in performance. In this work, we perform a simulation study on reducing the sim2real gap in autonomous docking through training various controllers and then evaluating them under realistic disturbances. In particular, we focus on the real-world challenge of docking under different payloads that are potentially outside the original training distribution. We explore existing methods for improving robustness including randomization techniques and history-conditioned controllers. Our findings provide insights into mitigating the sim2real gap when training docking controllers. Furthermore, our work indicates areas of future research that may be beneficial to the marine robotics community.</description>

      <title>Engagement and Disclosures in LLM-Powered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Exercises: A Factorial Design Comparing the Influence of a Robot vs. Chatbot Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many researchers are working to address the worldwide mental health crisis by developing therapeutic technologies that increase the accessibility of care, including leveraging large language model (LLM) capabilities in chatbots and socially assistive robots (SARs) used for therapeutic applications. Yet, the effects of these technologies over time remain unexplored. In this study, we use a factorial design to assess the impact of embodiment and time spent engaging in therapeutic exercises on participant disclosures. We assessed transcripts gathered from a two-week study in which 26 university student participants completed daily interactive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) exercises in their residences using either an LLM-powered SAR or a disembodied chatbot. We evaluated the levels of active engagement and high intimacy of their disclosures (opinions, judgments, and emotions) during each session and over time. Our findings show significant interactions between time and embodiment for both outcome measures: participant engagement and intimacy increased over time in the physical robot condition, while both measures decreased in the chatbot condition.</description>

      <title>Leveling the Playing Field: Carefully Comparing Classical and Learned Controllers for Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information, describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC, but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required. Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

      <title>Generative Grasp Detection and Estimation with Concept Learning-based Safety Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are often regarded as universal equations that can estimate any function. This flexibility, however, comes with the drawback of high complexity, rendering these networks into black box models, which is especially relevant in safety-centric applications. To that end, we propose a pipeline for a collaborative robot (Cobot) grasping algorithm that detects relevant tools and generates the optimal grasp. To increase the transparency and reliability of this approach, we integrate an explainable AI method that provides an explanation for the underlying prediction of a model by extracting the learned features and correlating them to corresponding classes from the input. These concepts are then used as additional criteria to ensure the safe handling of work tools. In this paper, we show the consistency of this approach and the criterion for improving the handover position. This approach was tested in an industrial environment, where a camera system was set up to enable a robot to pick up certain tools and objects.</description>

      <title>Geometric Contact Flows: Contactomorphisms for Dynamics and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, particularly those involving force exchange and dissipation, is crucial for applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robotics, but presents significant challenges due to the intricate interplay of geometric constraints and energy transfer. This paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GFC), a novel framework leveraging Riemannian and Contact geometry as inductive biases to learn such systems. GCF constructs a latent contact Hamiltonian model encoding desirable properties like stability or energy conservation. An ensemble of contactomorphisms then adapts this model to the target dynamics while preserving these properties. This ensemble allows for uncertainty-aware geodesics that attract the system's behavior toward the data support, enabling robust generalization and adaptation to unseen scenarios. Experiments on learning dynamics for physical systems and for controlling robots on interaction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Embedded Flexible Circumferential Sensing for Real-Time Intraoperative Environmental Perception in Continuum Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum robots have been widely adopted in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) because of their compact size and high flexibility. However, their proprioceptive capabilities remain limited, particularly in narrow lumens, where lack of environmental awareness can lead to unintended tissue contact and surgical risks. To address this challenge, this work proposes a flexible annular sensor structure integrated around the vertebral disks of continuum robots. The proposed design enables real-time environmental mapping by estimating the distance between the robotic disks and the surrounding tissue, thereby facilitating safer operation through advanced control strategies. The experiment has proven that its accuracy in obstacle detection can reach 0.19 mm. Fabricated using flexible printed circuit (FPC) technology, the sensor demonstrates a modular and cost-effective design with compact dimensions and low noise interference. Its adaptable parameters allow compatibility with various continuum robot architectures, offering a promising solution for enhancing intraoperative perception and control in surgical robotics.</description>

      <title>GeNIE: A Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable navigation in unstructured, real-world environments remains a significant challenge for embodied agents, especially when operating across diverse terrains, weather conditions, and sensor configurations. In this paper, we introduce GeNIE (Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild Environments), a robust navigation framework designed for global deployment. GeNIE integrates a generalizable traversability prediction model built on SAM2 with a novel path fusion strategy that enhances planning stability in noisy and ambiguous settings. We deployed GeNIE in the Earth Rover Challenge (ERC) at ICRA 2025, where it was evaluated across six countries spanning three continents. GeNIE took first place and achieved 79% of the maximum possible score, outperforming the second-best team by 17%, and completed the entire competition without a single human intervention. These results set a new benchmark for robust, generalizable outdoor robot navigation. We will release the codebase, pretrained model weights, and newly curated datasets to support future research in real-world navigation.</description>

      <title>Newtonian and Lagrangian Neural Networks: A Comparison Towards Efficient Inverse Dynamics Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate inverse dynamics models are essential tools for controlling industrial robots. Recent research combines neural network regression with inverse dynamics formulations of the Newton-Euler and the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion, resulting in so-called Newtonian neural networks and Lagrangian neural networks, respectively. These physics-informed models seek to identify unknowns in the analytical equations from data. Despite their potential, current literature lacks guidance on choosing between Lagrangian and Newtonian networks. In this study, we show that when motor torques are estimated instead of directly measuring joint torques, Lagrangian networks prove less effective compared to Newtonian networks as they do not explicitly model dissipative torques. The performance of these models is compared to neural network regression on data of a MABI MAX 100 industrial robot.</description>

      <title>ADA-DPM: A Neural Descriptors-based Adaptive Noise Point Filtering Strategy for SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR SLAM has demonstrated significant application value in various fields, including mobile robot navigation and high-precision map construction. However, existing methods often need to make a trade-off between positioning accuracy and system robustness when faced with dynamic object interference, point cloud noise, and unstructured environments. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive noise filtering SLAM strategy-ADA-DPM, achieving excellent preference in both aspects. We design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict the category of feature points belonging to dynamic points, to eliminate dynamic feature points; design the Global Importance Scoring Head to adaptively select feature points with higher contribution and features while suppressing noise interference; and construct the Cross Layer Intra-Graph Convolution Module (GLI-GCN) to fuse multi-scale neighborhood structures, thereby enhancing the discriminative ability of overlapping features. Finally, to further validate the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on several publicly available datasets and achieved outstanding results.</description>

      <title>StereoTacTip: Vision-based Tactile Sensing with Biomimetic Skin-Marker Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) stand out for their superior performance due to their high-information content output. Recently, marker-based VBTSs have been shown to give accurate geometry reconstruction when using stereo cameras. \uhl{However, many marker-based VBTSs use complex biomimetic skin-marker arrangements, which presents issues for the geometric reconstruction of the skin surface from the markers}. Here we investigate how the marker-based skin morphology affects stereo vision-based tactile sensing, using a novel VBTS called the StereoTacTip. To achieve accurate geometry reconstruction, we introduce: (i) stereo marker matching and tracking using a novel Delaunay-Triangulation-Ring-Coding algorithm; (ii) a refractive depth correction model that corrects the depth distortion caused by refraction in the internal media; (iii) a skin surface correction model from the marker positions, relying on an inverse calculation of normals to the skin surface; and (iv)~methods for geometry reconstruction over multiple contacts. To demonstrate these findings, we reconstruct topographic terrains on a large 3D map. Even though contributions (i) and (ii) were developed for biomimetic markers, they should improve the performance of all marker-based VBTSs. Overall, this work illustrates that a thorough understanding and evaluation of the morphologically-complex skin and marker-based tactile sensor principles are crucial for obtaining accurate geometric information.</description>

      <title>RoboTwin 2.0: A Scalable Data Generator and Benchmark with Strong Domain Randomization for Robust Bimanual Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and (2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147 categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels. Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%) on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark, dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.</description>

      <title>RoboArena: Distributed Real-World Evaluation of Generalist Robot Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist robot policies.</description>

      <title>Automated Plan Refinement for Improving Efficiency of Robotic Layup of Composite Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automation of composite sheet layup is essential to meet the increasing demand for composite materials in various industries. However, draping plans for the robotic layup of composite sheets are not robust. A plan that works well under a certain condition does not work well in a different condition. Changes in operating conditions due to either changes in material properties or working environment may lead a draping plan to exhibit suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework aimed at refining plans based on the observed execution performance. Our framework prioritizes the minimization of uncompacted regions while simultaneously improving time efficiency. To achieve this, we integrate human expertise with data-driven decision-making to refine expert-crafted plans for diverse production environments. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing significant reductions in the number of corrective paths required compared to initial expert-crafted plans. Through a combination of empirical data analysis, action-effectiveness modeling, and search-based refinement, our system achieves superior time efficiency in robotic layup. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in optimizing the layup process, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in composite manufacturing automation.</description>

      <title>Integrating LLMs and Digital Twins for Adaptive Multi-Robot Task Allocation in Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot systems are emerging as a promising solution to the growing demand for productivity, safety, and adaptability across industrial sectors. However, effectively coordinating multiple robots in dynamic and uncertain environments, such as construction sites, remains a challenge, particularly due to unpredictable factors like material delays, unexpected site conditions, and weather-induced disruptions. To address these challenges, this study proposes an adaptive task allocation framework that strategically leverages the synergistic potential of Digital Twins, Integer Programming (IP), and Large Language Models (LLMs). The multi-robot task allocation problem is formally defined and solved using an IP model that accounts for task dependencies, robot heterogeneity, scheduling constraints, and re-planning requirements. A mechanism for narrative-driven schedule adaptation is introduced, in which unstructured natural language inputs are interpreted by an LLM, and optimization constraints are autonomously updated, enabling human-in-the-loop flexibility without manual coding. A digital twin-based system has been developed to enable real-time synchronization between physical operations and their digital representations. This closed-loop feedback framework ensures that the system remains dynamic and responsive to ongoing changes on site. A case study demonstrates both the computational efficiency of the optimization algorithm and the reasoning performance of several LLMs, with top-performing models achieving over 97% accuracy in constraint and parameter extraction. The results confirm the practicality, adaptability, and cross-domain applicability of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Haptic-ACT -- Pseudo Oocyte Manipulation by a Robot Using Multimodal Information and Action Chunking with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce Haptic-ACT, an advanced robotic system for pseudo oocyte manipulation, integrating multimodal information and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT). Traditional automation methods for oocyte transfer rely heavily on visual perception, often requiring human supervision due to biological variability and environmental disturbances. Haptic-ACT enhances ACT by incorporating haptic feedback, enabling real-time grasp failure detection and adaptive correction. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-printed TPU soft gripper to facilitate delicate manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate that Haptic-ACT improves the task success rate, robustness, and adaptability compared to conventional ACT, particularly in dynamic environments. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning in robotics for biomedical automation.</description>

      <title>Robot Tactile Gesture Recognition Based on Full-body Modular E-skin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of robot electronic skin technology, various tactile sensors, enhanced by AI, are unlocking a new dimension of perception for robots. In this work, we explore how robots equipped with electronic skin can recognize tactile gestures and interpret them as human commands. We developed a modular robot E-skin, composed of multiple irregularly shaped skin patches, which can be assembled to cover the robot's body while capturing real-time pressure and pose data from thousands of sensing points. To process this information, we propose an equivariant graph neural network-based recognizer that efficiently and accurately classifies diverse tactile gestures, including poke, grab, stroke, and double-pat. By mapping the recognized gestures to predefined robot actions, we enable intuitive human-robot interaction purely through tactile input.</description>

      <title>Learning Approach to Efficient Vision-based Active Tracking of a Flying Target by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous tracking of flying aerial objects has important civilian and defense applications, ranging from search and rescue to counter-unmanned aerial systems (counter-UAS). Ground based tracking requires setting up infrastructure, could be range limited, and may not be feasible in remote areas, crowded cities or in dense vegetation areas. Vision based active tracking of aerial objects from another airborne vehicle, e.g., a chaser unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), promises to fill this important gap, along with serving aerial coordination use cases. Vision-based active tracking by a UAV entails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate (target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver decisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future time-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection. As a solution to the first problem, this paper presents a novel integration of standard deep learning based architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to achieve compute-efficient object detection without compromising accuracy, unlike standalone learning or filtering approaches. The proposed perception framework is validated using a lab-scale setup. For the second problem, to obviate the linearity assumptions and background variations limiting effectiveness of the traditional controllers, we present the use of reinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for fast computation of velocity maneuvers. New state space, action space and reward formulations are developed for this purpose, and training is performed in simulation using AirSim. The trained model is also tested in AirSim with respect to complex target maneuvers, and is found to outperform a baseline PID control in terms of tracking up-time and average distance maintained (from the target) during tracking.</description>

      <title>Improvement on LiDAR-Camera Calibration Using Square Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise sensor calibration is critical for autonomous vehicles as a prerequisite for perception algorithms to function properly. Rotation error of one degree can translate to position error of meters in target object detection at large distance, leading to improper reaction of the system or even safety related issues. Many methods for multi-sensor calibration have been proposed. However, there are very few work that comprehensively consider the challenges of the calibration procedure when applied to factory manufacturing pipeline or after-sales service scenarios. In this work, we introduce a fully automatic LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration algorithm based on targets that is fast, easy to deploy and robust to sensor noises such as missing data. The core of the method include: (1) an automatic multi-stage LiDAR board detection pipeline using only geometry information with no specific material requirement; (2) a fast coarse extrinsic parameter search mechanism that is robust to initial extrinsic errors; (3) a direct optimization algorithm that is robust to sensor noises. We validate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on data captured in real world scenarios.</description>

      <title>TritonZ: A Remotely Operated Underwater Rover with Manipulator Arm for Exploration and Rescue Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for underwater exploration and rescue operations enforces the development of advanced wireless or semi-wireless underwater vessels equipped with manipulator arms. This paper presents the implementation of a semi-wireless underwater vehicle, "TritonZ" equipped with a manipulator arm, tailored for effective underwater exploration and rescue operations. The vehicle's compact design enables deployment in different submarine surroundings, addressing the need for wireless systems capable of navigating challenging underwater terrains. The manipulator arm can interact with the environment, allowing the robot to perform sophisticated tasks during exploration and rescue missions in emergency situations. TritonZ is equipped with various sensors such as Pi-Camera, Humidity, and Temperature sensors to send real-time environmental data. Our underwater vehicle controlled using a customized remote controller can navigate efficiently in the water where Pi-Camera enables live streaming of the surroundings. Motion control and video capture are performed simultaneously using this camera. The manipulator arm is designed to perform various tasks, similar to grasping, manipulating, and collecting underwater objects. Experimental results shows the efficacy of the proposed remotely operated vehicle in performing a variety of underwater exploration and rescue tasks. Additionally, the results show that TritonZ can maintain an average of 13.5cm/s with a minimal delay of 2-3 seconds. Furthermore, the vehicle can sustain waves underwater by maintaining its position as well as average velocity.

      <title>Robotic Manipulation of a Rotating Chain with Bottom End Fixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of using a robot arm to manipulate a uniformly rotating chain with its bottom end fixed. Existing studies have investigated ideal rotational shapes for practical applications, yet they do not discuss how these shapes can be consistently achieved through manipulation planning. Our work presents a manipulation strategy for stable and consistent shape transitions. We find that the configuration space of such a chain is homeomorphic to a three-dimensional cube. Using this property, we suggest a strategy to manipulate the chain into different configurations, specifically from one rotation mode to another, while taking stability and feasibility into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in physical experiments by successfully transitioning from rest to the first two rotation modes. The concepts explored in our work has critical applications in ensuring safety and efficiency of drill string and yarn spinning operations.</description>

      <title>Robots and Children that Learn Together : Improving Knowledge Retention by Teaching Peer-Like Interactive Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in Learning-by-Teaching (LbT), few studies have explored how this paradigm can be implemented with autonomous, peer-like social robots in real classrooms. Most prior work has relied on scripted or Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time, interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary (memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions: (1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>Integrating Maneuverable Planning and Adaptive Control for Robot Cart-Pushing under Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and flexible cart-pushing is a challenging task for mobile robots. The motion constraints during cart-pushing and the robot's redundancy lead to complex motion planning problems, while variable payloads and disturbances present complicated dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel planning and control framework for flexible whole-body coordination and robust adaptive control. Our motion planning method employs a local coordinate representation and a novel kinematic model to solve a nonlinear optimization problem, thereby enhancing motion maneuverability by generating feasible and flexible push poses. Furthermore, we present a disturbance rejection control method to resist disturbances and reduce control errors for the complex control problem without requiring an accurate dynamic model. We validate our method through extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate the flexibility and robustness of cart-pushing methods in experiments.

      <title>Radar and Event Camera Fusion for Agile Robot Ego-Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar, First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and efficient velocity output in challenging environments.

      <title>GraspMAS: Zero-Shot Language-driven Grasp Detection with Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-driven grasp detection has the potential to revolutionize human-robot interaction by allowing robots to understand and execute grasping tasks based on natural language commands. However, existing approaches face two key challenges. First, they often struggle to interpret complex text instructions or operate ineffectively in densely cluttered environments. Second, most methods require a training or finetuning step to adapt to new domains, limiting their generation in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce GraspMAS, a new multi-agent system framework for language-driven grasp detection. GraspMAS is designed to reason through ambiguities and improve decision-making in real-world scenarios. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: Planner, responsible for strategizing complex queries; Coder, which generates and executes source code; and Observer, which evaluates the outcomes and provides feedback. Intensive experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate that our GraspMAS significantly outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, robot experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world settings further validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Motivational Architecture for Open-Ended Learning Challenges in Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing agents capable of autonomously interacting with complex and dynamic environments, where task structures may change over time and prior knowledge cannot be relied upon, is a key prerequisite for deploying artificial systems in real-world settings. The open-ended learning framework identifies the core challenges for creating such agents, including the ability to autonomously generate new goals, acquire the necessary skills (or curricula of skills) to achieve them, and adapt to non-stationary environments. While many existing works tackles various aspects of these challenges in isolation, few propose integrated solutions that address them simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce H-GRAIL, a hierarchical architecture that, through the use of different typologies of intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning mechanisms, autonomously discovers new goals, learns the required skills for their achievement, generates skill sequences for tackling interdependent tasks, and adapts to non-stationary environments. We tested H-GRAIL in a real robotic scenario, demonstrating how the proposed solutions effectively address the various challenges of open-ended learning.</description>

      <title>Mirror Eyes: Explainable Human-Robot Interaction at a Glance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gaze of a person tends to reflect their interest. This work explores what happens when this statement is taken literally and applied to robots. Here we present a robot system that employs a moving robot head with a screen-based eye model that can direct the robot's gaze to points in physical space and present a reflection-like mirror image of the attended region on top of each eye. We conducted a user study with 33 participants, who were asked to instruct the robot to perform pick-and-place tasks, monitor the robot's task execution, and interrupt it in case of erroneous actions. Despite a deliberate lack of instructions about the role of the eyes and a very brief system exposure, participants felt more aware about the robot's information processing, detected erroneous actions earlier, and rated the user experience higher when eye-based mirroring was enabled compared to non-reflective eyes. These results suggest a beneficial and intuitive utilization of the introduced method in cooperative human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>Design, fabrication and control of a cable-driven parallel robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cable driven parallel robots (CDPRs), the payload is suspended using a network of cables whose length can be controlled to maneuver the payload within the workspace. Compared to rigid link robots, CDPRs provide better maneuverability due to the flexibility of the cables and consume lesser power due to the high strength-to-weight ratio of the cables. However, amongst other things, the flexibility of the cables and the fact that they can only pull (and not push) render the dynamics of CDPRs complex. Hence advanced modelling paradigms and control algorithms must be developed to fully utilize the potential of CDPRs. Furthermore, given the complex dynamics of CDPRs, the models and control algorithms proposed for them must be validated on experimental setups to ascertain their efficacy in practice. We have recently developed an elaborate experimental setup for a CDPR with three cables and validated elementary open-loop motion planning algorithms on it. In this paper, we describe several aspects of the design and fabrication of our setup, including component selection and assembly, and present our experimental results. Our setup can reproduce complex phenomenon such as the transverse vibration of the cables seen in large CDPRs and will in the future be used to model and control such phenomenon and also to validate more sophisticated motion planning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning Point Correspondences In Radar 3D Point Clouds For Radar-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 3D point clouds in odometry estimation in robotics often requires finding a set of correspondences between points in subsequent scans. While there are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality, state-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point correspondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds from a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip (SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is based on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention mechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest mutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using set-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth set of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization problem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data. Additionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits supervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error, which is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We evaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights and with the widely used public Coloradar dataset. Evaluation shows that the proposed method improves the position estimation accuracy by over 14 % and 19 % on average, respectively. The open source code and datasets can be found here: https://github.com/aau-cns/radar_transformer.</description>

      <title>PG-LIO: Photometric-Geometric fusion for Robust LiDAR-Inertial Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is widely used for accurate state estimation and mapping which is an essential requirement for autonomous robots. Conventional LIO methods typically rely on formulating constraints from the geometric structure sampled by the LiDAR. Hence, in the lack of geometric structure, these tend to become ill-conditioned (degenerate) and fail. Robustness of LIO to such conditions is a necessity for its broader deployment. To address this, we propose PG-LIO, a real-time LIO method that fuses photometric and geometric information sampled by the LiDAR along with inertial constraints from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This multi-modal information is integrated into a factor graph optimized over a sliding window for real-time operation. We evaluate PG-LIO on multiple datasets that include both geometrically well-conditioned as well as self-similar scenarios. Our method achieves accuracy on par with state-of-the-art LIO in geometrically well-structured settings while significantly improving accuracy in degenerate cases including against methods that also fuse intensity. Notably, we demonstrate only 1 m drift over a 1 km manually piloted aerial trajectory through a geometrically self-similar tunnel at an average speed of 7.5m/s (max speed 10.8 m/s). For the benefit of the community, we shall also release our source code https://github.com/ntnu-arl/mimosa</description>

      <title>NOVA: Navigation via Object-Centric Visual Autonomy for High-Speed Target Tracking in Unstructured GPS-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions. We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full 6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame. To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.</description>

      <title>Safety-Aware Optimal Scheduling for Autonomous Masonry Construction using Collaborative Heterogeneous Aerial Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel high-level task planning and optimal coordination framework for autonomous masonry construction, using a team of heterogeneous aerial robotic workers, consisting of agents with separate skills for brick placement and mortar application. This introduces new challenges in scheduling and coordination, particularly due to the mortar curing deadline required for structural bonding and ensuring the safety constraints among UAVs operating in parallel. To address this, an automated pipeline generates the wall construction plan based on the available bricks while identifying static structural dependencies and potential conflicts for safe operation. The proposed framework optimizes UAV task allocation and execution timing by incorporating dynamically coupled precedence deadline constraints that account for the curing process and static structural dependency constraints, while enforcing spatio-temporal constraints to prevent collisions and ensure safety. The primary objective of the scheduler is to minimize the overall construction makespan while minimizing logistics, traveling time between tasks, and the curing time to maintain both adhesion quality and safe workspace separation. The effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving coordinated and time-efficient aerial masonry construction is extensively validated through Gazebo simulated missions. The results demonstrate the framework's capability to streamline UAV operations, ensuring both structural integrity and safety during the construction process.</description>

      <title>TDACloud: Point Cloud Recognition Using Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and localization. Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud that can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we propose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike voxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and outputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed TDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford RobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for object and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and transformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated, or rotated. Our results demonstrate high recognition accuracies in noisy conditions and large-scale real-world place recognition while outperforming the baselines by up to approximately 14%.</description>

      <title>DefFusionNet: Learning Multimodal Goal Shapes for Deformable Object Manipulation via a Diffusion-based Probabilistic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable object manipulation is critical to many real-world robotic applications, ranging from surgical robotics and soft material handling in manufacturing to household tasks like laundry folding. At the core of this important robotic field is shape servoing, a task focused on controlling deformable objects into desired shapes. The shape servoing formulation requires the specification of a goal shape. However, most prior works in shape servoing rely on impractical goal shape acquisition methods, such as laborious domain-knowledge engineering or manual manipulation. DefGoalNet previously posed the current state-of-the-art solution to this problem, which learns deformable object goal shapes directly from a small number of human demonstrations. However, it significantly struggles in multi-modal settings, where multiple distinct goal shapes can all lead to successful task completion. As a deterministic model, DefGoalNet collapses these possibilities into a single averaged solution, often resulting in an unusable goal. In this paper, we address this problem by developing DefFusionNet, a novel neural network that leverages the diffusion probabilistic model to learn a distribution over all valid goal shapes rather than predicting a single deterministic outcome. This enables the generation of diverse goal shapes and avoids the averaging artifacts. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on robotic tasks inspired by both manufacturing and surgical applications, both in simulation and on a physical robot. Our work is the first generative model capable of producing a diverse, multi-modal set of deformable object goals for real-world robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Physical Systems: Symplectification via Gauge Fixing in Dirac Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding geometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles, into neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate with high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic constraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the canonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants that guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this foundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs), the first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures, restoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems into a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent encoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space dynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet) to forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the ANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the gap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic learning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models, grounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.</description>

      <title>SViP: Sequencing Bimanual Visuomotor Policies with Object-Centric Motion Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL), particularly when leveraging high-dimensional visual inputs for policy training, has proven intuitive and effective in complex bimanual manipulation tasks. Nonetheless, the generalization capability of visuomotor policies remains limited, especially when small demonstration datasets are available. Accumulated errors in visuomotor policies significantly hinder their ability to complete long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SViP, a framework that seamlessly integrates visuomotor policies into task and motion planning (TAMP). SViP partitions human demonstrations into bimanual and unimanual operations using a semantic scene graph monitor. Continuous decision variables from the key scene graph are employed to train a switching condition generator. This generator produces parameterized scripted primitives that ensure reliable performance even when encountering out-of-the-distribution observations. Using only 20 real-world demonstrations, we show that SViP enables visuomotor policies to generalize across out-of-distribution initial conditions without requiring object pose estimators. For previously unseen tasks, SViP automatically discovers effective solutions to achieve the goal, leveraging constraint modeling in TAMP formulism. In real-world experiments, SViP outperforms state-of-the-art generative IL methods, indicating wider applicability for more complex tasks.

      <title>Reproducible Evaluation of Camera Auto-Exposure Methods in the Field: Platform, Benchmark and Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard datasets often present limitations, particularly due to the fixed nature of input data sensors, which makes it difficult to compare methods that actively adjust sensor parameters to suit environmental conditions. This is the case with Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods, which rely on environmental factors to influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have traditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments non-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that utilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This approach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along with its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory at different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In total, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting conditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with pose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired at various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images. Using this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that the classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support reproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack acquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and performance specifications. Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned from deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments.

      <title>GRAND-SLAM: Local Optimization for Globally Consistent Large-Scale Multi-Agent Gaussian SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an expressive scene representation for RGB-D visual SLAM, but its application to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor environments remains unexplored. Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework. Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.</description>

      <title>MinD: Unified Visual Imagination and Control via Hierarchical World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world modeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation. However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation. MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features, while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction. This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of unified world modeling in robotics.</description>

      <title>On the Power of Spatial Locality on Online Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the online versions of two fundamental routing problems, traveling salesman (TSP) and dial-a-ride (DARP), which have a variety of relevant applications in logistics and robotics. The online versions of these problems concern with efficiently serving a sequence of requests presented in a real-time on-line fashion located at points of a metric space by servers (salesmen/vehicles/robots). In this paper, motivated from real-world applications, such as Uber/Lyft rides, where some limited knowledge is available on the future requests, we propose the {\em spatial locality} model that provides in advance the distance within which new request(s) will be released from the current position of server(s). We study the usefulness of this advanced information on achieving the improved competitive ratios for both the problems with $k\geq 1$ servers, compared to the competitive results established in the literature without such spatial locality consideration. We show that small locality is indeed useful in obtaining improved competitive ratios irrespective of the metric space.</description>

      <title>VLA-OS: Structuring and Dissecting Planning Representations and Paradigms in Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms, representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference speeds.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Residual Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods, and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.</description>

      <title>DRAMA-X: A Fine-grained Intent Prediction and Risk Reasoning Benchmark For Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Sim2Real Gap via Neural Simulation Gap Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of neural simulation gap functions, which formally quantifies the gap between the mathematical model and the model in the high-fidelity simulator, which closely resembles reality. Many times, a controller designed for a mathematical model does not work in reality because of the unmodelled gap between the two systems. With the help of this simulation gap function, one can use existing model-based tools to design controllers for the mathematical system and formally guarantee a decent transition from the simulation to the real world. Although in this work, we have quantified this gap using a neural network, which is trained using a finite number of data points, we give formal guarantees on the simulation gap function for the entire state space including the unseen data points. We collect data from high-fidelity simulators leveraging recent advancements in Real-to-Sim transfer to ensure close alignment with reality. We demonstrate our results through two case studies - a Mecanum bot and a Pendulum.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal State Space Modeling for Real-time RGB-thermal Wild Scene Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless, multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal 2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution. Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are available at https://github.com/xiaodonguo/CMSSM.</description>

      <title>Evolving Prompts In-Context: An Open-ended, Self-replicating Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish" can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the "gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more effective LLM prompting.</description>

      <title>CFTel: A Practical Architecture for Robust and Scalable Telerobotics with Cloud-Fog Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Telerobotics is a key foundation in autonomous Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS), enabling remote operations across various domains. However, conventional cloud-based telerobotics suffers from latency, reliability, scalability, and resilience issues, hindering real-time performance in critical applications. Cloud-Fog Telerobotics (CFTel) builds on the Cloud-Fog Automation (CFA) paradigm to address these limitations by leveraging a distributed Cloud-Edge-Robotics computing architecture, enabling deterministic connectivity, deterministic connected intelligence, and deterministic networked computing. This paper synthesizes recent advancements in CFTel, aiming to highlight its role in facilitating scalable, low-latency, autonomous, and AI-driven telerobotics. We analyze architectural frameworks and technologies that enable them, including 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication, Edge Intelligence, Embodied AI, and Digital Twins. The study demonstrates that CFTel has the potential to enhance real-time control, scalability, and autonomy while supporting service-oriented solutions. We also discuss practical challenges, including latency constraints, cybersecurity risks, interoperability issues, and standardization efforts. This work serves as a foundational reference for researchers, stakeholders, and industry practitioners in future telerobotics research.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Cloud-Fog Automation for Autonomous Collision Detection and Classification in Intelligent Unmanned Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) technologies are foundational in driving maritime autonomy, particularly for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). However, onboard computational constraints and communication latency significantly restrict real-time data processing, analysis, and predictive modeling, hence limiting the scalability and responsiveness of maritime ICPS. To overcome these challenges, we propose a distributed Cloud-Edge-IoT architecture tailored for maritime ICPS by leveraging design principles from the recently proposed Cloud-Fog Automation paradigm. Our proposed architecture comprises three hierarchical layers: a Cloud Layer for centralized and decentralized data aggregation, advanced analytics, and future model refinement; an Edge Layer that executes localized AI-driven processing and decision-making; and an IoT Layer responsible for low-latency sensor data acquisition. Our experimental results demonstrated improvements in computational efficiency, responsiveness, and scalability. When compared with our conventional approaches, we achieved a classification accuracy of 86\%, with an improved latency performance. By adopting Cloud-Fog Automation, we address the low-latency processing constraints and scalability challenges in maritime ICPS applications. Our work offers a practical, modular, and scalable framework to advance robust autonomy and AI-driven decision-making and autonomy for intelligent USVs in future maritime ICPS.</description>

      <title>Drive-R1: Bridging Reasoning and Planning in VLMs for Autonomous Driving with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and (2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1 designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1 first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future research and applications.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing Ubiquitous Indoor Localization with Non-Cooperative Wi-Fi Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization opens the path to potentially transformative applications. Although many indoor localization methods have been proposed over the years, they remain too impractical for widespread deployment in the real world. In this paper, we introduce PeepLoc, a deployable and scalable Wi-Fi-based solution for indoor localization that relies only on pre-existing devices and infrastructure. Specifically, PeepLoc works on any mobile device with an unmodified Wi-Fi transceiver and in any indoor environment with a sufficient number of Wi-Fi access points (APs) and pedestrian traffic. At the core of PeepLoc is (a) a mechanism which allows any Wi-Fi device to obtain non-cooperative time-of-flight (ToF) to any Wi-Fi AP and (b) a novel bootstrapping mechanism that relies on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and crowdsourcing to opportunistically initialize pre-existing APs as anchor points within an environment. We implement PeepLoc using commodity hardware and evaluate it extensively across 4 campus buildings. We show PeepLoc leads to a mean and median positional error of 3.41 m and 3.06 m respectively, which is superior to existing deployed indoor localization systems and is competitive with commodity GPS in outdoor environments.</description>

      <title>MCN-SLAM: Multi-Agent Collaborative Neural SLAM with Hybrid Implicit Neural Scene Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam (DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and communication. The dataset and code will open-source on https://github.com/dtc111111/mcnslam.</description>

      <title>Including Semantic Information via Word Embeddings for Skeleton-based Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0 to assist in assembly tasks. However, conventional skeleton-based methods often lose keypoint semantics, limiting their effectiveness in complex interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings to encode semantic information. Our method replaces one-hot encodings with semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance, and enhances generalization capabilities by simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.</description>

Abstract: Object tracking in inland waterways plays a crucial role in safe and cost-effective applications, including waterborne transportation, sightseeing tours, environmental monitoring and surface rescue. Our Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), equipped with a 4D radar, a monocular camera, a GPS, and an IMU, delivers robust tracking capabilities in complex waterborne environments. By leveraging these sensors, our USV collected comprehensive object tracking data, which we present as USVTrack, the first 4D radar-camera tracking dataset tailored for autonomous driving in new generation waterborne transportation systems. Our USVTrack dataset presents rich scenarios, featuring diverse various waterways, varying times of day, and multiple weather and lighting conditions. Moreover, we present a simple but effective radar-camera matching method, termed RCM, which can be plugged into popular two-stage association trackers. Experimental results utilizing RCM demonstrate the effectiveness of the radar-camera matching in improving object tracking accuracy and reliability for autonomous driving in waterborne environments. The USVTrack dataset is public on https://usvtrack.github.io.</description>

      <title>BRAVE: Brain-Controlled Prosthetic Arm with Voice Integration and Embodied Learning for Enhanced Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to enable intuitive control of prosthetic limbs for individuals with upper limb amputations. However, existing EEG-based control systems face challenges related to signal noise, classification accuracy, and real-time adaptability. In this work, we present BRAVE, a hybrid EEG and voice-controlled prosthetic system that integrates ensemble learning-based EEG classification with a human-in-the-loop (HITL) correction framework for enhanced responsiveness. Unlike traditional electromyography (EMG)-based prosthetic control, BRAVE aims to interpret EEG-driven motor intent, enabling movement control without reliance on residual muscle activity. To improve classification robustness, BRAVE combines LSTM, CNN, and Random Forest models in an ensemble framework, achieving a classification accuracy of 96% across test subjects. EEG signals are preprocessed using a bandpass filter (0.5-45 Hz), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for artifact removal, and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature extraction to minimize contamination from electromyographic (EMG) and electrooculographic (EOG) signals. Additionally, BRAVE incorporates automatic speech recognition (ASR) to facilitate intuitive mode switching between different degrees of freedom (DOF) in the prosthetic arm. The system operates in real time, with a response latency of 150 ms, leveraging Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) networking for synchronized data acquisition. The system is evaluated on an in-house fabricated prosthetic arm and on multiple participants highlighting the generalizability across users. The system is optimized for low-power embedded deployment, ensuring practical real-world application beyond high-performance computing environments. Our results indicate that BRAVE offers a promising step towards robust, real-time, non-invasive prosthetic control.</description>

      <title>SWA-SOP: Spatially-aware Window Attention for Semantic Occupancy Prediction in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields consistent gains across modalities.</description>

      <title>OC-SOP: Enhancing Vision-Based 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction by Object-Centric Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However, conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP (OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all categories on SemanticKITTI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path planning is crucial for the efficient operation of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in factory environments. Many existing algorithms rely on Dubins paths, which have been adapted for various applications. However, an efficient method for directly determining the shortest Dubins path remains underdeveloped. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to efficiently identify the shortest path within the Dubins set. We classify the initial and final configurations into six equivalency groups based on the quadrants formed by their orientation angle pairs. Paths within each group exhibit shared topological properties, enabling a reduction in the number of candidate cases to analyze. This pre-classification step simplifies the problem and eliminates the need to explicitly compute and compare the lengths of all possible paths. As a result, the proposed method significantly lowers computational complexity. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Accurate Simulation and Parameter Identification of Deformable Linear Objects using Discrete Elastic Rods in Generalized Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a fast and accurate model of a deformable linear object (DLO) -- e.g., a rope, wire, or cable -- integrated into an established robot physics simulator, MuJoCo. Most accurate DLO models with low computational times exist in standalone numerical simulators, which are unable or require tedious work to handle external objects. Based on an existing state-of-the-art DLO model -- Discrete Elastic Rods (DER) -- our implementation provides an improvement in accuracy over MuJoCo's own native cable model. To minimize computational load, our model utilizes force-lever analysis to adapt the Cartesian stiffness forces of the DER into its generalized coordinates. As a key contribution, we introduce a novel parameter identification pipeline designed for both simplicity and accuracy, which we utilize to determine the bending and twisting stiffness of three distinct DLOs. We then evaluate the performance of each model by simulating the DLOs and comparing them to their real-world counterparts and against theoretically proven validation tests.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Multi-Robot Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time). We also validate our approach on multiple real robots in the Georgia Tech Robotarium under imperfect communication, demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and scalability across number of robots.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based learning of contact plans for agile locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03639v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legged robots have become capable of performing highly dynamic maneuvers in the past few years. However, agile locomotion in highly constrained environments such as stepping stones is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a combination of model-based control, search, and learning to design efficient control policies for agile locomotion on stepping stones. In our framework, we use nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to generate whole-body motions for a given contact plan. To efficiently search for an optimal contact plan, we propose to use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). While the combination of MCTS and NMPC can quickly find a feasible plan for a given environment (a few seconds), it is not yet suitable to be used as a reactive policy. Hence, we generate a dataset for optimal goal-conditioned policy for a given scene and learn it through supervised learning. In particular, we leverage the power of diffusion models in handling multi-modality in the dataset. We test our proposed framework on a scenario where our quadruped robot Solo12 successfully jumps to different goals in a highly constrained environment.</description>

      <title>LoopSR: Looping Sim-and-Real for Lifelong Policy Adaptation of Legged Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown its remarkable and generalizable capability in legged locomotion through sim-to-real transfer. However, while adaptive methods like domain randomization are expected to enhance policy robustness across diverse environments, they potentially compromise the policy's performance in any specific environment, leading to suboptimal real-world deployment due to the No Free Lunch theorem. To address this, we propose LoopSR, a lifelong policy adaptation framework that continuously refines RL policies in the post-deployment stage. LoopSR employs a transformer-based encoder to map real-world trajectories into a latent space and reconstruct a digital twin of the real world for further improvement. Autoencoder architecture and contrastive learning methods are adopted to enhance feature extraction of real-world dynamics. Simulation parameters for continual training are derived by combining predicted values from the decoder with retrieved parameters from a pre-collected simulation trajectory dataset. By leveraging simulated continual training, LoopSR achieves superior data efficiency compared with strong baselines, yielding eminent performance with limited data in both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real experiments.</description>

      <title>G3Flow: Generative 3D Semantic Flow for Pose-aware and Generalizable Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</description>

      <title>Learning to Adapt through Bio-Inspired Gait Strategies for Versatile Quadruped Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Legged robots must adapt their gait to navigate unpredictable environments, a challenge that animals master with ease. However, most deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches to quadruped locomotion rely on a fixed gait, limiting adaptability to changes in terrain and dynamic state. Here we show that integrating three core principles of animal locomotion-gait transition strategies, gait memory and real-time motion adjustments enables a DRL control framework to fluidly switch among multiple gaits and recover from instability, all without external sensing. Our framework is guided by biomechanics-inspired metrics that capture efficiency, stability and system limits, which are unified to inform optimal gait selection. The resulting framework achieves blind zero-shot deployment across diverse, real-world terrains and substantially significantly outperforms baseline controllers. By embedding biological principles into data-driven control, this work marks a step towards robust, efficient and versatile robotic locomotion, highlighting how animal motor intelligence can shape the next generation of adaptive machines.</description>

      <title>Structured Pneumatic Fingerpads for Actively Tunable Grip Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grip surfaces with tunable friction can actively modify contact conditions, enabling transitions between higher- and lower-friction states for grasp adjustment. Friction can be increased to grip securely and then decreased to gently release (e.g., for handovers) or manipulate in-hand. Recent friction-tuning surface designs using soft pneumatic chambers show good control over grip friction; however, most require complex fabrication processes and/or custom gripper hardware. We present a practical structured fingerpad design for friction tuning that uses less than $1 USD of materials, takes only seconds to repair, and is easily adapted to existing grippers. Our design uses surface morphology changes to tune friction. The fingerpad is actuated by pressurizing its internal chambers, thereby deflecting its flexible grip surface out from or into these chambers. We characterize the friction-tuning capabilities of our design by measuring the shear force required to pull an object from a gripper equipped with two independently actuated fingerpads. Our results show that varying actuation pressure and timing changes the magnitude of friction forces on a gripped object by up to a factor of 2.8. We demonstrate additional features including macro-scale interlocking behaviour and pressure-based object detection.</description>

Abstract: As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</description>

      <title>Object State Estimation Through Robotic Active Interaction for Biological Autonomous Drilling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the state of biological specimens is challenging due to limited observation through microscopic vision. For instance, during mouse skull drilling, the appearance alters little when thinning bone tissue because of its semi-transparent property and the high-magnification microscopic vision. To obtain the object's state, we introduce an object state estimation method for biological specimens through active interaction based on the deflection. The method is integrated to enhance the autonomous drilling system developed in our previous work. The method and integrated system were evaluated through 12 autonomous eggshell drilling experiment trials. The results show that the system achieved a 91.7% successful ratio and 75% detachable ratio, showcasing its potential applicability in more complex surgical procedures such as mouse skull craniotomy. This research paves the way for further development of autonomous robotic systems capable of estimating the object's state through active interaction.</description>

Abstract: Datasets for object detection often do not account for enough variety of glasses, due to their transparent and reflective properties. Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue to robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. The paper introduces a novel method for the acquisition of real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The data set consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Human Behavior Prediction Using Multimodal Large Language Models: Challenges and Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting human behavior in shared environments is crucial for safe and efficient human-robot interaction. Traditional data-driven methods to that end are pre-trained on domain-specific datasets, activity types, and prediction horizons. In contrast, the recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) promise open-ended cross-domain generalization to describe various human activities and make predictions in any context. In particular, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are able to integrate information from various sources, achieving more contextual awareness and improved scene understanding. The difficulty in applying general-purpose MLLMs directly for prediction stems from their limited capacity for processing large input sequences, sensitivity to prompt design, and expensive fine-tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of applying pre-trained MLLMs for context-aware human behavior prediction. To this end, we introduce a modular multimodal human activity prediction framework that allows us to benchmark various MLLMs, input variations, In-Context Learning (ICL), and autoregressive techniques. Our evaluation indicates that the best-performing framework configuration is able to reach 92.8% semantic similarity and 66.1% exact label accuracy in predicting human behaviors in the target frame.</description>

      <title>A real-time anomaly detection method for robots based on a flexible and sparse latent space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for robots to operate effectively in diverse environments necessitates the need for robust real-time anomaly detection techniques during robotic operations. However, deep learning-based models in robotics face significant challenges due to limited training data and highly noisy signal features. In this paper, we present Sparse Masked Autoregressive Flow-based Adversarial AutoEncoder model to address these problems. This approach integrates Masked Autoregressive Flow model into Adversarial AutoEncoders to construct a flexible latent space and utilize Sparse autoencoder to efficiently focus on important features, even in scenarios with limited feature space. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 4.96% to 9.75% higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for pick-and-place robotic operations with randomly placed cans, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it showed up to 19.67% better performance in scenarios involving collisions with lightweight objects. Additionally, unlike the existing state-of-the-art model, our model performs inferences within 1 millisecond, ensuring real-time anomaly detection. These capabilities make our model highly applicable to machine learning-based robotic safety systems in dynamic environments.

      <description>arXiv:2504.17880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method of coverage path planning for the purpose of scanning an unstructured environment autonomously. The method uses the morphological skeleton of the prior 2D navigation map via SLAM to generate a sequence of points of interest (POIs). This sequence is then ordered to create an optimal path given the robot's current position. To control the high-level operation, a finite state machine is used to switch between two modes: navigating towards a POI using Nav2, and scanning the local surrounding. We validate the method in a leveled indoor obstacle-free non-convex environment on time efficiency and reachability over five trials. The map reader and the path planner can quickly process maps of width and height ranging between [196,225] pixels and [185,231] pixels in 2.52 ms/pixel and 1.7 ms/pixel, respectively, where their computation time increases with 22.0 ns/pixel and 8.17 $\mu$s/pixel, respectively. The robot managed to reach 86.5% of all waypoints over all five runs. The proposed method suffers from drift occurring in the 2D navigation map.</description>

Abstract: Robots with multi-modal locomotion are an active research field due to their versatility in diverse environments. In this context, additional actuation can provide humanoid robots with aerial capabilities. Flying humanoid robots face challenges in modeling and control, particularly with aerodynamic forces. This paper addresses these challenges from a technological and scientific standpoint. The technological contribution includes the mechanical design of iRonCub-Mk1, a jet-powered humanoid robot, optimized for jet engine integration, and hardware modifications for wind tunnel experiments on humanoid robots for precise aerodynamic forces and surface pressure measurements. The scientific contribution offers a comprehensive approach to model and control aerodynamic forces using classical and learning techniques. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations calculate aerodynamic forces, validated through wind tunnel experiments on iRonCub-Mk1. An automated CFD framework expands the aerodynamic dataset, enabling the training of a Deep Neural Network and a linear regression model. These models are integrated into a simulator for designing aerodynamic-aware controllers, validated through flight simulations and balancing experiments on the iRonCub-Mk1 physical prototype.</description>

      <title>OWMM-Agent: Open World Mobile Manipulation With Multi-modal Agentic Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made mobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world mobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for generalization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the systematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level robot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state. To address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture that maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and controls the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination from domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an agentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our task domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM as the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global scene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in a unified model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves SOTA performance compared to other foundation models including GPT-4o and strong zero-shot generalization in real world.

      <title>DriveSuprim: Towards Precise Trajectory Selection for End-to-End Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely. Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>GAF: Gaussian Action Field as a Dynamic World Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate action inference is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a Vision-to-4D-to-Action (V-4D-A) framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion. Furthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF facilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33% over state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Agile, Autonomous Spacecraft Constellations with Disruption Tolerant Networking to Monitor Precipitation and Urban Floods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully re-orientable small spacecraft are now supported by commercial technologies, allowing them to point their instruments in any direction and capture images, with short notice. When combined with improved onboard processing, and implemented on a constellation of inter-communicable satellites, this intelligent agility can significantly increase responsiveness to transient or evolving phenomena. We demonstrate a ground-based and onboard algorithmic framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control, inter-satellite communication, intelligent prediction and planning to schedule the time-varying, re-orientation of agile, small satellites in a constellation. Planner intelligence is improved by updating the predictive value of future space-time observations based on shared observations of evolving episodic precipitation and urban flood forecasts. Reliable inter-satellite communication within a fast, dynamic constellation topology is modeled in the physical, access control and network layer. We apply the framework on a representative 24-satellite constellation observing 5 global regions. Results show appropriately low latency in information exchange (average within 1/3rd available time for implicit consensus), enabling the onboard scheduler to observe ~7% more flood magnitude than a ground-based implementation. Both onboard and offline versions performed ~98% better than constellations without agility.</description>

      <title>Learning Accurate Whole-body Throwing with High-frequency Residual Policy and Pullback Tube Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Throwing is a fundamental skill that enables robots to manipulate objects in ways that extend beyond the reach of their arms. We present a control framework that combines learning and model-based control for prehensile whole-body throwing with legged mobile manipulators. Our framework consists of three components: a nominal tracking policy for the end-effector, a high-frequency residual policy to enhance tracking accuracy, and an optimization-based module to improve end-effector acceleration control. The proposed controller achieved the average of 0.28 m landing error when throwing at targets located 6 m away. Furthermore, in a comparative study with university students, the system achieved a velocity tracking error of 0.398 m/s and a success rate of 56.8%, hitting small targets randomly placed at distances of 3-5 m while throwing at a specified speed of 6 m/s. In contrast, humans have a success rate of only 15.2%. This work provides an early demonstration of prehensile throwing with quantified accuracy on hardware, contributing to progress in dynamic whole-body manipulation.</description>

      <title>IDCAIS: Inter-Defender Collision-Aware Interception Strategy against Multiple Attackers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.12098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the prior literature on multi-agent area defense games, the assignments of the defenders to the attackers are done based on a cost metric associated only with the interception of the attackers. In contrast to that, this paper presents an Inter-Defender Collision-Aware Interception Strategy (IDCAIS) for defenders to intercept attackers in order to defend a protected area, such that the defender-to-attacker assignment protocol not only takes into account an interception-related cost but also takes into account any possible future collisions among the defenders on their optimal interception trajectories. In particular, in this paper, the defenders are assigned to intercept attackers using a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) that: 1) minimizes the sum of times taken by defenders to capture the attackers under time-optimal control, as well as 2) helps eliminate or delay possible future collisions among the defenders on the optimal trajectories. To prevent inevitable collisions on optimal trajectories or collisions arising due to time-sub-optimal behavior by the attackers, a minimally augmented control using exponential control barrier function (ECBF) is also provided. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach.</description>

      <title>Active Fine-Tuning of Multi-Task Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained generalist policies are rapidly gaining relevance in robot learning due to their promise of fast adaptation to novel, in-domain tasks. This adaptation often relies on collecting new demonstrations for a specific task of interest and applying imitation learning algorithms, such as behavioral cloning. However, as soon as several tasks need to be learned, we must decide which tasks should be demonstrated and how often? We study this multi-task problem and explore an interactive framework in which the agent adaptively selects the tasks to be demonstrated. We propose AMF (Active Multi-task Fine-tuning), an algorithm to maximize multi-task policy performance under a limited demonstration budget by collecting demonstrations yielding the largest information gain on the expert policy. We derive performance guarantees for AMF under regularity assumptions and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness to efficiently fine-tune neural policies in complex and high-dimensional environments.</description>

      <title>SurgSora: Object-Aware Diffusion Model for Controllable Surgical Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgical video generation can enhance medical education and research, but existing methods lack fine-grained motion control and realism. We introduce SurgSora, a framework that generates high-fidelity, motion-controllable surgical videos from a single input frame and user-specified motion cues. Unlike prior approaches that treat objects indiscriminately or rely on ground-truth segmentation masks, SurgSora leverages self-predicted object features and depth information to refine RGB appearance and optical flow for precise video synthesis. It consists of three key modules: (1) the Dual Semantic Injector, which extracts object-specific RGB-D features and segmentation cues to enhance spatial representations; (2) the Decoupled Flow Mapper, which fuses multi-scale optical flow with semantic features for realistic motion dynamics; and (3) the Trajectory Controller, which estimates sparse optical flow and enables user-guided object movement. By conditioning these enriched features within the Stable Video Diffusion, SurgSora achieves state-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability in advancing surgical video synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Our human evaluation in collaboration with expert surgeons further demonstrates the high realism of SurgSora-generated videos, highlighting the potential of our method for surgical training and education.

Abstract: We present the POPGym Arcade, a collection of hardware-accelerated, pixel-based environments with shared observation and action spaces. Each environment includes fully and partially observable variants, enabling counterfactual studies on partial observability. We also introduce mathematical tools for analyzing policies under partial observability, which reveal how agents recall past information to make decisions. Our analysis shows (1) that controlling for partial observability is critical and (2) that agents with long-term memory learn brittle policies that struggle to generalize. Finally, we demonstrate that recurrent policies can be "poisoned" by old, out-of-distribution observations, with implications for sim-to-real transfer, imitation learning, and offline reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Manipulation with Demonstration-Augmented Reward, Policy, and World Model Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon tasks in robotic manipulation present significant challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) due to the difficulty of designing dense reward functions and effectively exploring the expansive state-action space. However, despite a lack of dense rewards, these tasks often have a multi-stage structure, which can be leveraged to decompose the overall objective into manageable subgoals. In this work, we propose DEMO3, a framework that exploits this structure for efficient learning from visual inputs. Specifically, our approach incorporates multi-stage dense reward learning, a bi-phasic training scheme, and world model learning into a carefully designed demonstration-augmented RL framework that strongly mitigates the challenge of exploration in long-horizon tasks. Our evaluations demonstrate that our method improves data-efficiency by an average of 40% and by 70% on particularly difficult tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We validate this across 16 sparse-reward tasks spanning four domains, including challenging humanoid visual control tasks using as few as five demonstrations.</description>

      <title>HybridVLA: Collaborative Diffusion and Autoregression in a Unified Vision-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental objective of manipulation policy design is to endow robots to comprehend human instructions, reason about scene cues, and execute generalized actions in dynamic environments. Recent autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) methods inherit common-sense reasoning capabilities from vision-language models (VLMs) for next action-token prediction. However, these methods quantize actions into discrete bins, which disrupts the continuity required for precise control. In contrast, existing diffusion-based VLA methods incorporate an additional diffusion head to predict continuous actions solely conditioned on feature representations extracted by the VLM, without fully leveraging the VLM's pretrained reasoning capabilities through token-level generation. To address these limitations, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that absorbs the continuous nature of diffusion-based actions and the contextual reasoning of autoregression within a single large language model. To mitigate interference between the two generation paradigms, we propose a collaborative training recipe that seamlessly incorporates diffusion denoising into the next-token prediction process. With this recipe, we find these two action prediction methods not only reinforce each other but also exhibit varying strength across different tasks. Therefore, we design a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses both predictions, leading to more robust control. HybridVLA outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 14\% and 19\% in mean success rate on simulation and real-world tasks, respectively, while demonstrating stable manipulation in unseen configurations.</description>

      <title>SALT: A Flexible Semi-Automatic Labeling Tool for General LiDAR Point Clouds with Cross-Scene Adaptability and 4D Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a flexible Semi-Automatic Labeling Tool (SALT) for general LiDAR point clouds with cross-scene adaptability and 4D consistency. Unlike recent approaches that rely on camera distillation, SALT operates directly on raw LiDAR data, automatically generating pre-segmentation results. To achieve this, we propose a novel zero-shot learning paradigm, termed data alignment, which transforms LiDAR data into pseudo-images by aligning with the training distribution of vision foundation models. Additionally, we design a 4D-consistent prompting strategy and 4D non-maximum suppression module to enhance SAM2, ensuring high-quality, temporally consistent presegmentation. SALT surpasses the latest zero-shot methods by 18.4% PQ on SemanticKITTI and achieves nearly 40-50% of human annotator performance on our newly collected low-resolution LiDAR data and on combined data from three LiDAR types, significantly boosting annotation efficiency. We anticipate that SALT's open-sourcing will catalyze substantial expansion of current LiDAR datasets and lay the groundwork for the future development of LiDAR foundation models. Code is available at https://github.com/Cavendish518/SALT.</description>

      <title>Learning to Insert for Constructive Neural Vehicle Routing Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimisation (NCO) is a promising learning-based approach for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) without extensive manual design. While existing constructive NCO methods typically follow an appending-based paradigm that sequentially adds unvisited nodes to partial solutions, this rigid approach often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we explore the idea of insertion-based paradigm and propose Learning to Construct with Insertion-based Paradigm (L2C-Insert), a novel learning-based method for constructive NCO. Unlike traditional approaches, L2C-Insert builds solutions by strategically inserting unvisited nodes at any valid position in the current partial solution, which can significantly enhance the flexibility and solution quality. The proposed framework introduces three key components: a novel model architecture for precise insertion position prediction, an efficient training scheme for model optimization, and an advanced inference technique that fully exploits the insertion paradigm's flexibility. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) demonstrate that L2C-Insert consistently achieves superior performance across various problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Cross from Left to Right Brain: Adaptive Text Dreamer for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires the agent to navigate by following natural instructions under partial observability, making it difficult to align perception with language. Recent methods mitigate this by imagining future scenes, yet they rely on vision-based synthesis, leading to high computational cost and redundant details. To this end, we propose to adaptively imagine key environmental semantics via \textit{language} form, enabling a more reliable and efficient strategy. Specifically, we introduce a novel Adaptive Text Dreamer (ATD), a dual-branch self-guided imagination policy built upon a large language model (LLM). ATD is designed with a human-like left-right brain architecture, where the left brain focuses on logical integration, and the right brain is responsible for imaginative prediction of future scenes. To achieve this, we fine-tune only the Q-former within both brains to efficiently activate domain-specific knowledge in the LLM, enabling dynamic updates of logical reasoning and imagination during navigation. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-interaction mechanism to regularize the imagined outputs and inject them into a navigation expert module, allowing ATD to jointly exploit both the reasoning capacity of the LLM and the expertise of the navigation model. We conduct extensive experiments on the R2R benchmark, where ATD achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.
