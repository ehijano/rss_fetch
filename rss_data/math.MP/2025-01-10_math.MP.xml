      <title>Quantum Birkhoff Normal Form in the $\sigma$-Bruno-R\"{u}ssmann non-resonant condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct a Gevrey quantum Birkhoff normal form for the $h$-differential operator $P_{h}(t),$ where $ t\in(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$, in the neighborhood of the union $\Lambda$ of KAM tori. This construction commences from an appropriate Birkhoff normal form of $H$ around $\Lambda$ and proceeds under the $\sigma$-Bruno-R\"{u}ssmann condition with $\sigma&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Properties of the one-component Coulomb gas on a sphere with two macroscopic external charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-component Coulomb gas on the sphere, consisting on $N$ unit charges interacting via a logarithmic potential, and in the presence of two external charges each of strength proportional to $N$, is considered. There are two spherical caps naturally associated with the external charges, giving rise to two distinct phases depending on them not overlapping (post-critical) or overlapping (pre-critical). The equilibrium measure in the post-critical phase is known from earlier work. We determine the equilibrium measure in the pre-critical phase using a particular conformal map, with the parameters therein specified in terms of a root of a certain fourth order polynomial. This is used to determine the exact form of the electrostatic energy for the pre-critical phase. Using a duality relation from random matrix theory, the partition function for the Coulomb gas at the inverse temperature $\beta = 2$ can be expanded for large $N$ in the post-critical phase, and in a scaling region of the post and pre-critical boundary. For the pre-critical phase, the duality identity implies a relation between two electrostatic energies, one for the present sphere system, and the other for a certain constrained log-gas relating to the Jacobi unitary ensemble.</description>

      <title>Duality, asymptotic charges and algebraic topology in mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper the duality map between electric-like asymptotic charges of $p$-form gauge theories is studied. The outcome is an existence and uniqueness theorem and the topological nature of the duality map. The goal of this work is to extend that theorem in the case of mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories in order to have a deeper understanding of exotic gauge theories, of the non-trivial charges associated to them and of the duality of their observables. Unlike the simpler case of $p$-form gauge theories, here we need to develop some new mathematical tools. The crucial points are to view a mixed symmetry tensor as a Young projected object of the $N$-multi-form space and to develop an analogue of de Rham complex for mixed symmetry tensors. As a result, if the underlying manifold satisfy appropriate conditions, the duality map can be proven to exist and to be unique ensuring the charge of a description has information on the dual ones.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose--Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schr\"odinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Representation Theory of Lorentzian Pseudo-Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach to the finite dimensional representation theory of the entire Lorentz group $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$ is presented. It is shown that the entire Lorentz group may be understood as a semi-direct product between the identity component of the entire Lorentz group, and the Klein four group of reflections: $\operatorname{O}(1,3) = \operatorname{SO}^+(1,3) \rtimes \operatorname{K}_4$. The discussion concludes with the convenient representation theory of generic tensor representations of $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$, namely that there are four physically meaningful representations of $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$ for each representation of $\operatorname{SO}^+(1,3)$. There is a brief discussion of the time reversal of the electromagnetic field, concluding in agreement with standard texts such as Jackson, and works by Malament.</description>

      <title>On the effect of the maximal proper acceleration in the inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15077v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of a hypothetical maximal proper acceleration on the mass of a charged particles is investigated in the context of particle accelerators. In particular, it is shown that maximal proper acceleration implies an increase in the kinetic energy of the particle being accelerated with respect to the relativistic energy. Such an increase in kinetic energy leads to a reduction of the luminosity of the bunches with respect to the expected luminosity in the relativistic models of the bunches. This relative loss in luminosity is of the order $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-5}$ for the LHC bunches and can be of order up to $10^{-3}$ for certain laser plasma accelerator facilities. Although the effect is small, it increases with the square of the bunch population.</description>

      <title>Nondipole interaction between two uniformly magnetized spheres and its relation to superconducting levitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytically solving the magnetostatic Maxwell equations in the bispherical coordinates, we calculate the magnetic field around two uniformly magnetized spheres oriented so that their magnetic moments are parallel to the axis passing through the centers of the spheres. We demonstrate that, contrary to what is often claimed in the literature, the magnetic interaction between such spheres is not equivalent to the interaction between two point magnetic dipoles placed in the centers of the spheres. The nonzero levitation force acting on a uniformly magnetized sphere or a point magnetic dipole above a superconducting sphere in the ideal Meissner state is a clear manifestation of the non-equivalence.</description>

      <title>An original classification of obscuration-free telescopes designs unfolded in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we propose an original classification method for unobscured imaging systems unfolded in two dimensions. This classification is based on a study of off-axis properties, and relies on topology and algorithm of real algebraic geometry to find at least one instance by connected component of a semialgebraic set. Our corresponding nomenclature provides intrinsic information about the system, in terms of geometry and manufacturability. The proposed systems for each name of the nomenclature, can be used as starting points for parallel optimizations, allowing for a much more comprehensive search of an unobscured solution, given a set of specifications. We exemplify our method on three and four mirrors imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in cyclic sign invariant quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study bipartite quantum states that are invariant under the local action of the cyclic sign group. Due to symmetry, these states are sparse and can be parameterized by a triple of vectors. Their important semi-definite properties, such as positivity and positivity under partial transpose (PPT), can be simply characterized in terms of these vectors and their discrete Fourier transforms. We study in detail the entanglement properties of this family of symmetric states, showing in particular that it contains PPT entangled states. For states that are diagonal in the Dicke basis, deciding separability is equivalent to a circulant version of the complete positivity problem. We provide some geometric results for the PPT cone, showing in particular that it is polyhedral. In local dimension less than 5, we completely characterize these sets and construct entanglement witnesses; some partial results are also obtained for d = 6, 7. Finally, we initiate the study of cyclic sign covariant quantum channels, showing in particular that the PPT squared conjecture holds for some of these maps.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Quasi-Periodically Driven Quantum Critical Systems: Analytical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study analytically the phase transitions in quasi-periodically driven one dimensional quantum critical systems that are described by conformal field theories (CFTs). The phase diagrams and phase transitions can be analytically obtained by using Avila's global theory in one-frequency quasiperiodic cocycles. Compared to the previous works where the quasiperiodicity was introduced in the driving time and no phase transitions were observed [1], here we propose a setup where the quasiperiodicity is introduced in the driving Hamiltonians. In our setup, one can observe the heating phases, non-heating phases, and the phase transitions. The phase diagram as well as the Lyapunov exponents that determine the entanglement entropy evolution can be analytically obtained. In addition, based on Avila's theory, we prove there is no phase transition in the previously proposed setup of quasi-periodically driven CFTs [1]. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of entanglement entropy on lattice models.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM), conceived as an error suppression paradigm without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose non-Markovian Noise Mitigation (NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions (BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on the spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Scatter correction based on quasi-Monte Carlo for CT reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scatter signals can degrade the contrast and resolution of computed tomography (CT) images and induce artifacts. How to effectively correct scatter signals in CT has always been a focal point of research for researchers. This work presents a new framework for eliminating scatter artifacts in CT. In the framework, the interaction between photons and matter is characterized as a Markov process, and the calculation of the scatter signal intensity in CT is transformed into the computation of a $4n$-dimensional integral, where $n$ is the highest scatter order. Given the low-frequency characteristics of scatter signals in CT, this paper uses the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method combined with forced fixed detection and down sampling to compute the integral. In the reconstruction process, the impact of scatter signals on the X-ray energy spectrum is considered. A scatter-corrected spectrum estimation method is proposed and applied to estimate the X-ray energy spectrum. Based on the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm, a multi-module coupled reconstruction method, referred to as FDK-QMC-BM4D, has been developed to simultaneously eliminate scatter artifacts, beam hardening artifacts, and noise in CT imaging. Finally, the effectiveness of the FDK-QMC-BM4D method is validated in the Shepp-Logan phantom and head. Compared to the widely recognized Monte Carlo method, which is the most accurate method by now for estimating and correcting scatter signals in CT, the FDK-QMC-BM4D method improves the running speed by approximately $102$ times while ensuring accuracy. By integrating the mechanism of FDK-QMC-BM4D, this study offers a novel approach to addressing artifacts in clinical CT.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the bullet cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many body gravity (MBG) is an alternate theory of gravity, which has been able to explain the galaxy rotation curves, the radial acceleration relation (RAR) and the wide binary stars (WBS). The genesis of MBG is a novel theory, which models systems with thermal gradients, by recasting the variation in the temperature as a variation in the metric. Merging the above concept with Einstein's gravity, leads to the theory of thermal gravity in 5-D space-time-temperature. Thermal gravity when generalized for partially thermalized systems, results in the theory of many body gravity. The bullet cluster is supposed to be a smoking gun evidence for the presence of dark matter. However, this work demonstrates that the MBG theory can explain the weak gravitational lensing effect of the bullet cluster, without the need for yet undiscovered baryonic matter or dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We study the semisimplification of the full karoubian subcategory generated by the irreducible finite dimensional representations of the algebraic supergroup $GL(m|n)$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. This semisimplification is equivalent to the representations of a pro-reductive group $H_{m|n}$. We show that there is a canonical decomposition $H_{m|n} \cong GL(m\!-\! n) \times H_{n|n}$, thereby reducing the determination of $H_{m|n}$ to the equal rank case $m\! =\! n$ which was treated in a previous paper.</description>

      <title>Counting Equilibria of the Electrostatic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A century and a half ago, James C. Maxwell conjectured that the number of zeroes of the electric field (equilibria of the potential) generated by a collection of $n$ point charges is at most $(n-1)^2$. In 2007 Gabrielov, Novikov, and Shapiro proved a much larger upper bound and posed two further conjectures. It is quite possible that Maxwell's quadratic upper bound is not tight, so it is prudent to find lower bounds. Our main contributions in this article are:

      <description>arXiv:2501.05349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum cellular automata for one-dimensional chains of Fermionic modes and study their implementability as finite depth quantum circuits. Fermionic automata have been classified in terms of an index modulo circuits and the addition of ancillary systems. We strengthen this result removing the ancilla degrees of freedom in defining the equivalence classes. A complete characterization of nearest-neighbours automata is given. A class of Fermionic automata is found which cannot be expressed in terms of single mode and controlled-phase gates composed with shifts, as is the case for qubit cellular automata.</description>

      <title>The supercritical phase of the $\varphi^4$ model is well behaved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we analyse the $\varphi^4$ model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in the supercritical regime $\beta &gt; \beta_c$. We consider a random cluster representation of the $\varphi^4$ model, which corresponds to an Ising random cluster model on a random environment. We prove that the supercritical phase of this percolation model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ ($d\geq 2$) is well behaved in the sense that for every $\beta&gt;\beta_c$, local uniqueness of macroscopic clusters happens with high probability, uniformly in boundary conditions. This result provides the basis for renormalisation techniques used to study several fine properties of the supercritical phase. As an application, we obtain surface order large deviation bounds for the empirical magnetisation of the $\varphi^4$ model in the entire supercritical regime.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of almost-honeycomb structures in low-energy planar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several commonly observed physical and biological systems are arranged in shapes that closely resemble an honeycomb cluster, that is, a tessellation of the plane by regular hexagons. Although these shapes are not always the direct product of energy minimization, they can still be understood, at least phenomenologically, as low-energy configurations. In this paper, explicit quantitative estimates on the geometry of such low-energy configurations are provided, showing in particular that the vast majority of the chambers must be generalized polygons with six edges, and be closely resembling regular hexagons. Part of our arguments is a detailed revision of the estimates behind the global isoperimetric principle for honeycomb clusters due to Hales (T. C. Hales. The honeycomb conjecture. Discrete Comput. Geom., 25(1):1-22, 2001).</description>

      <title>Hidden convexity and Dafermos' principle for some dispersive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover an abstract structure behind several nonlinear dispersive equations (including the NLS, NLKG and GKdV equations with generic defocusing power-law nonlinearities) that is reminiscent of hyperbolic conservation laws. The underlying abstract problem admits an "entropy" that is formally conserved. The entropy is determined by a strictly convex function that naturally generates an anisotropic Orlicz space. For such problems, we introduce the dual matrix-valued variational formulation in the spirit of [Y. Brenier. Comm. Math. Phys. (2018) 364(2) 579-605] and prove several results related to existence, uniqueness and consistency on large time intervals. As an application, we show that no subsolution of the problems that fit into our framework is able to dissipate the total entropy earlier or faster than the strong solution on the interval of existence of the latter. This result (we call it Dafermos' principle) is new even for "isotropic" problems such as the incompressible Euler system.</description>

Abstract: We give a short non-technical introduction to the Ising model, and review some successes as well as challenges which have emerged from its study in probability and mathematical physics. This includes the infinite-volume theory of phase transitions, and ideas like scaling, renormalization group, universality, SLE, and random symmetry breaking in disordered systems and networks. This note is based on a talk given on 15 August 2024, as part of the Ising lecture during the 11th Bernoulli-IMS world congress, Bochum.</description>

      <title>Edge modes in modulated metamaterials based on the three-gap theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new paradigm for generating complex structured materials based on the three-gap theorem that unifies and generalises several key concepts in the study of localised edge states. Our model has both the discretised coupling strengths of the SSH model and a modulation parameter that can be used to characterise the spectral flow of edge modes and produce images reminiscent of the Hofstadter butterfly. By defining a localisation factor associated to each eigenmode, we are able to establish conditions for the existence of localised edge states in finite systems. This allows us to compare their eigenfrequencies with the spectra of the corresponding infinitely periodic problem and characterise the rich pattern of localised edge modes appearing and disappearing (in the sense of becoming delocalised) as the parameters of our three-gap algorithm are varied.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Holomorphic Symplectic Manifolds: Analytic Continuation of Path Integrals and Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Berezin's quantization $q:M\to\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ to holomorphic symplectic manifolds, which involves replacing the state space $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ with its complexification $\text{T}^*\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}.$ We show that this is equivalent to replacing rank$\unicode{x2013}$1 Hermitian projections with all rank$\unicode{x2013}$1 projections. We furthermore allow the states to be points in the cotangent bundle of a Grassmanian. We also define a holomorphic path integral quantization as a certain idempotent in a convolution algebra and we prove that these two quantizations are equivalent. For each $n&gt;0,$ we construct a faithful functor from the category of finite dimensional $C^*$$\unicode{x2013}$algebras to to the category of hyperk\"{a}hler manifolds and we show that our quantization recovers the original $C^*$$\unicode{x2013}$algebra. In particular, this functor comes with a homomorphism from the commutator algebra of the $C^*$$\unicode{x2013}$algebra to the Poisson algebra of the associated hyperk\"{a}hler manifold. Related to this, we show that the cotangent bundles of Grassmanians have commuting almost complex structures that are compatible with a holomorphic symplectic form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a Poisson algebra bundle whose distributional sections are suitable to represent multilocal observables in classical field theory. To do this, we work with vector bundles over the unordered configuration space of a manifold $M$ and consider the structure of a $2$-monoidal category given by the usual (Hadamard) tensor product of bundles and a new (Cauchy) tensor product which provides a symmetrized version of the usual external tensor product of vector bundles on $M$. We use the symmetric algebras with respect to both products to obtain a Poisson 2-algebra bundle mimicking the construction of Peierls bracket from the causal propagator in field theory. The explicit description of observables from this Poisson algebra bundle will be carried out in a forthcoming paper.</description>

Abstract: In this article we investigate the behavior of multi-matrix unitary invariant models under a potential $V_\beta=\beta U+W$ when the inverse temperature $\beta$ becomes very large. We first prove, under mild hypothesis on the functionals $U,W$ that as soon at these potentials are "confining" at infinity, the sequence of spectral distribution of the matrices are tight when the dimension goes to infinity. Their limit points are solutions of Dyson-Schwinger's equations. Next we investigate a few specific models, most importantly the "strong single variable model" where $U$ is a sum of potentials in a single matrix and the "strong commutator model" where $U = -[X,Y]^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a deformed Schwarzschild black hole from the de Sitter gauge theory of gravity within Dunkl generalization and we determine the metric coefficients versus Dunkl parameter and parity operators. Since the spacetime coordinates are not affected by the group transformations, only fields are allowed to change under the action of the symmetry group. A particular ansatz for the gauge fields is chosen and the components of the strength tensor are computed as well. Additionally, we analyze the modifications on the thermodynamic properties to a spherically symmetric black hole due to Dunkl parameters for even and odd parities. Finally, we verify a novel remark highlighted from heat capacity: the appearance of a phase transition when the odd parity is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Vector Space Integration for Dark Matter Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a highly efficient integration method for scattering calculations, and a ``partial rate matrix'' that encodes the scattering rate as a function of the $SO(3)$ orientation of the detector. This replaces the original multidimensional rate integral with a simple exercise in vector multiplication, speeding up the rate calculation by a factor of around $10^8$. I include a scheme to fully factorize the dark matter particle model, its astrophysical velocity distribution, and the properties of the target material from each other, enabling efficient calculation of the partial rate matrix even in studies comparing large sets of these input functions. This is now the only sensible way to evaluate the dark matter scattering rate in anisotropic detector materials. It is straightforward to generalize this method to other difficult but linear problems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Harmonic Integration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new integration method drastically improves the efficiency of the dark matter direct detection calculation. In this work I introduce a complete, orthogonal basis of spherical wavelet-harmonic functions, designed for the new vector space integration method. This factorizes the numeric calculation into a ``vector'' that depends only on the astrophysical velocity distribution; a second vector, depending only on the detector form factor; and a scattering matrix defined on the basis functions, which depends on the details of the dark matter (DM) particle model (e.g.~its mass). For common spin-independent DM--Standard Model interactions, this scattering matrix can be evaluated analytically in the wavelet-harmonic basis. This factorization is particularly helpful for the more complicated analyses that have become necessary in recent years, especially those involving anisotropic detector materials or more realistic models of the local DM velocity distribution. With the new method, analyses studying large numbers of detector orientations and DM particle models can be performed more than 10~million times faster.
  This paper derives several analytic results for the spherical wavelets, including an extrapolation in the space of wavelet coefficients, and a generalization of the vector space method to a much broader class of linear functional integrals. Both results are highly relevant outside the field of DM direct detection.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We establish (paying particular attention to large or small ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and of the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansion terms as linear combinations of higher-order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$ with rational polynomial coefficients. The parametrizations are fine-tuned so that the expansion coefficients in the Gaussian cases are, for given $n$, the limits $p\to\infty$ of those of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focusing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with large sample sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A huge progress in studying holographic theories is that holography can be interpreted via the quantum error correction, which makes equal the entanglement wedge reconstruction, the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh formula, the radial commutativity and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We call the equivalence the reconstruction theorem, whose infinite-dimensional generalization via algebraic language was believed to exclude the algebraic version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. However, recent developments regarding gravitational algebras have shown that the inclusion of the algebraic Ryu-Takayanagi formula is plausible. In this letter, we prove that such inclusion holds for the cases of type I/II factors, which are expected to describe holographic theories.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

Abstract: We prove that meromorphic differentials $\omega^{(0)}_n(z_1,...,z_n)$ which are recursively generated by an involution identity are symmetric in all their arguments $z_1,...,z_n$. The proof involves an intriguing combinatorial identity between integer partitions into given number of parts.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive Central Limit Theorem for the Stochastic Burgers Equation at the critical dimension</title>

Abstract: The Stochastic Burgers Equation (SBE) is a singular, non-linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) that describes, on mesoscopic scales, the fluctuations of stochastic driven diffusive systems with a conserved scalar quantity. In space dimension d = 2, the SBE is critical, being formally scale invariant under diffusive scaling. As such, it falls outside of the domain of applicability of the theories of Regularity Structures and paracontrolled calculus. In apparent contrast with the formal scale invariance, we fully prove the conjecture first appeared in [H. van Beijeren, R. Kutner, &amp; H. Spohn, Phys. Rev. Lett., 1986] according to which the 2d-SBE is logarithmically superdiffusive, i.e. its diffusion coefficient diverges like $(\log t)^{2/3}$ as $t\to\infty$, thus removing subleading diverging multiplicative corrections in [D. De Gaspari &amp; L. Haunschmid-Sibitz, Electron. J. Probab., 2024] and in [H.-T. Yau, Ann. of Math., 2004] for 2d-ASEP. We precisely identify the constant prefactor of the logarithm and show it is proportional to $\lambda^{4/3}$, for $\lambda&gt;0$ the coupling constant, which, intriguingly, turns out to be exactly the same as for the one-dimensional Stochastic Burgers/KPZ equation. More importantly, we prove that, under super-diffusive space-time rescaling, the SBE has an explicit Gaussian fixed point in the Renormalization Group sense, by deriving a superdiffusive central limit-type theorem for its solution.
  This is the first scaling limit result for a critical singular SPDE, beyond the weak coupling regime, and is obtained via a refined control, on all length-scales, of the resolvent of the generator of the SBE. We believe our methods are well-suited to study other out-of-equilibrium driven diffusive systems at the critical dimension, such as 2d-ASEP, which, we conjecture, have the same large-scale Fixed Point as SBE.</description>
