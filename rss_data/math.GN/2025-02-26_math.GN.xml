      <title>On non-Hausdorff manifolds</title>

Abstract: We investigate various aspects of non-Hausdorff manifolds (NH-manifold for short). First, we extend some known results about which covering properties, together with (a weakening of) homogeneity, imply that a manifold is Hausdorff. Writing $NH_X(x)$ for the subset of points of a space $X$ which cannot be separated of $x$ by open sets, we exhibit homogeneous NH-manifolds $M$ of dimension $\ge 2$ such that $NH_M(x)$ is non-homogeneous (in particular, non discrete), and give various properties that imply discreteness of $NH_M(x)$ (mainly in dimension $1$). We show that there is an everywhere non-Hausdorff hereditarily separable manifold under CH. We also construct various examples of somewhat pathological NH-manifolds. In particular, we show that there are NH-manifolds $M$ with a point $x\in M$ such that $NH_M(x)$ is a copy of: the Cantor space, any special tree, any $\Psi$-space (dimension $1$), the real line, the long ray, (part of) boundaries of domains in the plane (dimension $2$). We also build a homogeneous $1$-dimensional NH-manifold $M$ such that for each $x,y$ there is some $z$ with $x\in NH_M(z)$, $z\in NH_M(y)$. We start by recalling basic properties of NH-manifolds and use elementary (or at least well known) methods of general or set theoretic topology, with a little bit of conformal theory for some of the examples. Many pictures are given to illustrate the constructions.</description>
