      <title>On the importance of slow ions in the kinetic Bohm criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between a plasma and a solid target lies a positively charged `sheath' of several Debye lengths $\lambda_{\rm D}$ in width, typically much smaller than the characteristic length scale $L$ of the main plasma. This scale separation implies that the asymptotic limit $\epsilon = \lambda_{\rm D} / L \rightarrow 0$ is useful to solve for the plasma-sheath system. In this limit, the Bohm criterion must be satisfied at the sheath entrance. A new derivation of the kinetic criterion, admitting a general ion velocity distribution, is presented. It is proven that for $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ the distribution of the velocity component normal to the target, $v_x$, and its first derivative must vanish for $|v_x| \rightarrow 0$ at the sheath entrance. The kinetic Bohm criterion emerges by combining these two conditions with a third integral one upon integrating by parts twice. A subsequent interchange of the limits $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ and $|v_x| \rightarrow 0$ is shown to be invalid, causing a divergence which underlies a common misconception that the criterion gives undue importance to slow ions.</description>

      <title>A Plasma-Based Approach for High-Power Tunable Microwave Varactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a tunable varactor with tunability in the range of 100s of MHz and a capacitance delta of about 36 pF by employing a perpendicular magnetic field to a capacitively-coupled (CCP) RF plasma cell. A comprehensive high-frequency circuit model for the fabricated varactor is proposed and verified experimentally for a plasma electron number density of $2.95\times10^{17}m^{-3}$ which has a tunability of 146 MHz with a magnetic flux density ranging from 0 to 246 milliTesla. Under a pressure of 64 milliTorrs, the Argon ccp was found to have a variable capacitance ranging from 4 pF to 41.72 pF.</description>

      <title>Numerical dissipation induced by the low-pass filtering in nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De-aliasing is an essential procedure for eliminating the aliasing error in nonlinear simulations, such as nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence simulations. An ideal approach to de-aliasing in the periodic dimension is Fourier truncation. Finite difference low-pass filtering applied in the non-periodic direction strongly dampens aliasing modes. At the same time, it induces numerical dissipation in the region of the physically realistic solution. It is shown analytically that the long-wave dissipation coefficient is proportional to the (Np-3) power of the wavenumber under desirable constraints satisfying the highest order accuracy, where Np is the number of filter points. Numerical results after applying the optimised low-pass filtering to the nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence simulation suggest that the nine-point format preserves intact mesoscopic zonal structures in Tokamak plasmas, and is therefore suitable for long-time nonlinear turbulence simulations.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving particle methods for the Landau collision operator using the metriplectic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel family of particle discretisation methods for the nonlinear Landau collision operator. We exploit the metriplectic structure underlying the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system in order to obtain disretisation schemes that automatically preserve mass, momentum, and energy, warrant monotonic dissipation of entropy, and are thus guaranteed to respect the laws of thermodynamics. In contrast to recent works that used radial basis functions and similar methods for regularisation, here we use an auxiliary spline or finite element representation of the distribution function to this end. Discrete gradient methods are employed to guarantee the aforementioned properties in the time discrete domain as well.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach to the design of RF photoinjector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this thesis is to ascertain the dimensions of an RF 2.856GHz photoinjector through a combination of analytical and computational approaches. The phase velocity within a single cavity exceeds 'c', rendering it inadequate for storing the requisite energy for beam acceleration. To surmount this limitation, we aim to devise a multi-celled cavity design. However, the alterations in electromagnetic fields and resonant frequency within the multi-celled cavity are intricate and sensitive, presenting challenges in obtaining precise dimensions solely via computer simulations. Prior to numerical methods, it is essential to analyze the photoinjector using theoretical frameworks. We employ perturbation theory and the construction of an equivalent circuit to elucidate the underlying physics of the photoinjector and the electrical oscillations within the cell structure. Detailed analytical methods for the equivalent circuit are explored. Through theoretical analysis, the dimensions and simulation outcomes can be determined quantitatively.</description>

      <title>High Fidelity simulations of the multi-species Vlasov equation in the electro-static, collisional-less limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of occurrence and strength of kinetic instabilities in plasmas remains a significant challenge in nuclear fusion research. To accurately capture the plasmas dynamics one is required to solve the Vlasov equation for several species which, however, comes with a number of challenges as high dimensionality of the model as well as turbulence and development of fine but relevant structures in the distribution function. The predominantly employed Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method often lacks the accuracy to resolve the dynamics correctly, which can only be remedied by going to higher resolutions but at a prohibitorily high cost due to the high-dimensionality. Thus in this work we discuss the usage of the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) as high fidelity approach, in contrast to e.g. PIC or grid-based approaches, to solve the multi-species Vlasov equation in modes leading to kinetic instabilities.</description>

      <title>Rapid Computation of the Plasma Dispersion Function: Rational and Multi-pole Approximation, and Improved Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasma dispersion function $Z(s)$ is a fundamental complex special integral function widely used in the field of plasma physics. The simplest and most rapid, yet accurate, approach to calculating it is through rational or equivalent multi-pole expansions. In this work, we summarize the numerical coefficients that are practically useful to the community. Besides the Pade approximation to obtain coefficients, which are accurate for both small and large arguments, we also employ optimization methods to enhance the accuracy of the approximation for the intermediate range. The best coefficients provided here for calculating $Z(s)$ can deliver twelve significant decimal digits. This work serves as a foundational database for the community for further applications.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic investigation of toroidal Alfven eigenmode (TAE) turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes (TAEs) can transport fusion-born energetic particles out of the plasma volume, thereby decreasing plasma self-heating efficiency and possibly damaging reactor walls. Therefore, understanding TAE destabilisation and identifying saturation mechanisms is crucial to achieving burning plasma. While TAEs have been studies extensively in the past using kinetic-MHD codes, here a fully gyrokinetic study is employed which allows for additional physics. In the case studied, the primary drive mechanism is identified as the resonance between the magnetic drifts and the TAE, and this is seen to be disrupted by equilibrium flow shear which can stabilize the mode by rotating it in the the poloidal plane. It is found that zonal flows do not play a significant role in the saturation of these TAEs, and there are no saturation mechanisms present in the local gyrokinetic picture that are able to saturate the mode at physically relevant transport levels in the case of TAE-only turbulence. Instead, we confirm that the global profile flattening of fast-ion density is the key saturation mechanism. The nonlinear excitation of TAE travelling along the electron diamagnetic direction and its beating with the ion diamagnetic TAE, resulting in large amplitude oscillations that may help detect TAEs more easily in tokamaks, is also reported.</description>

      <title>Evolution of secondary electron spectrum during cosmic-ray discharge in the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently found that streaming cosmic rays (CRs) induce a resistive electric field that can accelerate secondary electrons produced by CR ionization. In this work, we study the evolution of the energy spectrum of secondary electrons by numerically solving the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation and Ohm's law. We show that the accelerated secondary electrons further ionize a gas, that is, the electron avalanche occurs, resulting in increased ionization and excitation of the gas. Although the resistive electric field becomes weaker than one before the CR discharge, the weak resistive electric field weakly accelerates the secondary electrons. The quasi-steady state is almost independent of the initial resistive electric field, but depends on the electron fraction in the gas. The resistive electric field in the quasi-steady state is larger for the higher electron fraction, which makes the number of secondary electrons that can ionize the gas larger, resulting in a higher ionization rate. The CR discharge could explain the high ionization rate that are observed in some molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Continuum damping of topologically-protected edge modes at the boundary of a magnetized plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent extension of the topological ideas to continuous systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as magnetized plasmas, provides new insights into the nature of scattering-free topologically-protected surface plasma waves (TSPWs). We demonstrate a unique characteristic of TSPWs propagating above the electron cyclotron frequency: their collisionless damping via coupling to the continuum of resonant modes localized inside a smooth plasma-vacuum interface. Damped TSPWs retain their unidirectional nature and robustness against backscattering. When sheared magnetic field creates a boundary between damped and undamped TSPWs, the two refract into each other without reflections</description>

      <title>GX: a GPU-native gyrokinetic turbulence code for tokamak and stellarator design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06731v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GX is a code for solving the nonlinear gyrokinetic system for low-frequency turbulence in magnetized plasmas, particularly tokamaks and stellarators. In GX, our primary motivation and target is a fast gyrokinetic solver that can be used for fusion reactor design and optimization along with wide-ranging physics exploration. This has led to several code and algorithm design decisions, specifically chosen to prioritize time to solution. First, we have used a discretization algorithm that is pseudo-spectral in the entire phase-space, including a Laguerre-Hermite pseudo-spectral formulation of velocity space, which allows for smooth interpolation between coarse gyrofluid-like resolutions and finer conventional gyrokinetic resolutions and efficient evaluation of a model collision operator. Additionally, we have built GX to natively target graphics processors (GPUs), which are among the fastest computational platforms available today. Finally, we have taken advantage of the reactor-relevant limit of small $\rho_*$ by using the radially-local flux-tube approach. In this paper we present details about the gyrokinetic system and the numerical algorithms used in GX to solve the system. We then present several numerical benchmarks against established gyrokinetic codes in both tokamak and stellarator magnetic geometries to verify that GX correctly simulates gyrokinetic turbulence in the small $\rho_*$ limit. Moreover, we show that the convergence properties of the Laguerre-Hermite spectral velocity formulation are quite favorable for nonlinear problems of interest. Coupled with GPU acceleration, which we also investigate with scaling studies, this enables GX to be able to produce useful turbulence simulations in minutes on one (or a few) GPUs. GX is open-source software that is ready for fusion reactor design studies.</description>

      <title>Polarized QED Cascades over Pulsar Polar Caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of $e^\pm$ plasmas within pulsar magnetospheres through quantum electrodynamics (QED) cascades in vacuum gaps is widely acknowledged. This paper aims to investigate the effect of photon polarization during the QED cascade occurring over the polar cap of a pulsar. We employ a Monte Carlo-based QED algorithm that accurately accounts for both spin and polarization effects during photon emission and pair production in both single-particle and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Our findings reveal distinctive properties in the photon polarization of curvature radiation (CR) and synchrotron radiation (SR). CR photons exhibit high linear polarization parallel to the plane of the curved magnetic field lines, whereas SR photons, on average, demonstrate weak polarization. As the QED cascade progresses, SR photons gradually dominate over CR photons, thus reducing the average degree of photon polarization. Additionally, our study highlights an intriguing observation: the polarization of CR photons enhances $e^\pm$ pair production by approximately 5%, in contrast to the inhibition observed in laser-plasma interactions. Our self-consistent QED PIC simulations in the corotating frame reproduce the essential results obtained from single-particle simulations.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the type-III radiation observed near the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AIMS 1. To use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data to test the accepted theory that type-III radiation is produced by counter-streaming Langmuir waves that coalesce to produce the electromagnetic wave at twice the Langmuir frequency. 2. If this theory is found to be incorrect, to replace it with a description of type-III generation that is consistent with the PSP data.
  METHODS To obtain new properties of the Langmuir wave and its harmonics, their phase velocities and density fluctuations were measured. If the harmonic wave was electromagnetic, as in the accepted theory, these quantities would not be measurable. However, in an electrostatic wave, they would be measurable by the PSP instruments.
  RESULTS The Langmuir wave and its harmonics at frequencies of n{\omega}p, where {\omega}p = 2PI*125 kHz is the Langmuir frequency and n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, were measured in an active type-III event. The lowest harmonics contained density fluctuations, so they were electrostatic waves and not type-III emissions. This result was bolstered by measuring their very slow phase velocities (~2000 km/sec) which are not those of a type-III wave. Thus, the harmonic waves were not a result of the three-wave interaction (as required by the accepted theory) but they were electrostatic antenna waves produced by radiation of the Langmuir wave. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation.</description>
