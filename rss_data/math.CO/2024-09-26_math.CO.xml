      <title>Bounds on the Complete Forcing Number of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A forcing set for a perfect matching of a graph is defined as a subset of the edges of that perfect matching such that there exists a unique perfect matching containing it. A complete forcing set for a graph is a subset of its edges, such that it intersects the edges of every perfect matching in a forcing set of that perfect matching. The size of a smallest complete forcing set of a graph is called the complete forcing number of the graph. In this paper, we derive new upper bounds for the complete forcing number of graphs in terms of other graph theoretical parameters such as the degeneracy or the spectral radius of the graph. We show that for graphs with the number of edges more than some constant times the number of vertices, our result outperforms the best known upper bound for the complete forcing number. For the set of edge-transitive graphs, we present a lower bound for the complete forcing number in terms of maximum forcing number. This result in particular is applied to the hypercube graphs and Cartesian powers of even cycles.</description>

      <title>Weighted Padovan graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted Padovan graphs $\Phi^{n}_{k}$, $n \geq 1$, $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{2n-2}{3} \rfloor$, are introduced as the graphs whose vertices are all Padovan words of length $n$ with $k$ $1$s, two vertices being adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by replacing exactly one $01$ with a $10$. By definition, $\sum_k |V(\Phi^{n}_{k})|=P_{n+2}$, where $P_n$ is the $n$th Padovan number. Two families of graphs isomorphic to weighted Padovan graphs are presented. The order, the size, the degree, the diameter, the cube polynomial, and the automorphism group of weighted Padovan graphs are determined. It is also proved that they are median graphs.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture about pattern avoidance of cycle permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi$ be a cycle permutation that can be expressed as one-line $\pi = \pi_1\pi_2 \cdot\cdot\cdot \pi_n$ and a cycle form $\pi = (c_1,c_2, ..., c_n)$. Archer et al. introduced the notion of pattern avoidance of one-line and all cycle forms for a cycle permutation $\pi$, defined as $\pi_1\pi_2 \cdot\cdot\cdot \pi_n$ and its arbitrary cycle form $c_ic_{i+1}\cdot\cdot\cdot c_nc_1c_2\cdot\cdot\cdot c_{i-1}$ avoid a given pattern. Let $\mathcal{A}^\circ_n(\sigma; \tau)$ denote the set of cyclic permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$ that avoid $\sigma$ in their one-line form and avoid $\tau$ in their all cycle forms. In this note, we prove that $|\mathcal{A}^\circ_n(2431; 1324)|$ is the $(n-1)^{\rm{st}}$ Pell number for any positive integer $n$. Thereby, we give a positive answer to a conjecture of Archer et al.</description>

      <title>Improved bound on the number of edges of diameter-$k$-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is diameter-$k$-critical if its diameter equals $k$ and the deletion of any edge increases its diameter. The Murty-Simon Conjecture states that for any diameter-2-critical graph $G$ of order $n$, $e(G) \leq \lfloor \frac{n^2}{4}\rfloor$, with equality if and only if $G \cong K_{\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor,\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil}$. F\"uredi (JGT,1992) proved that this conjecture is true for sufficiently large $n$. Over two decades later, Loh and Ma (JCT-B, 2016) proved that $e(G) \leq \frac{n^2}{6}+o(n^2)$ for diameter-3-critical graphs $G$, and
  $e(G) \leq \frac{3n^2}{k}$ for diameter-$k$-critical graphs $G$ with $k \geq 4$. In this paper, we improve the bound for diameter-$k$-critical graphs to $ \frac{n^2}{2k}+o(n^2)$.</description>

      <title>The difference between the chromatic and the cochromatic number of a random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cochromatic number $\zeta(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of colours needed for a vertex colouring where every colour class is either an independent set or a clique. Let $\chi(G)$ denote the usual chromatic number. Around 1991 Erd\H{o}s and Gimbel asked: For the random graph $G \sim G_{n, 1/2}$, does $\chi(G)-\zeta(G) \rightarrow \infty$ whp? Erd\H{o}s offered \$100 for a positive and \$1,000 for a negative answer.
  We give a positive answer to this question for roughly 95% of all values $n$.</description>

      <title>Powers of large matrices on GPU platforms to compute the Roman domination number of cylindrical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Roman domination in a graph $G$ is a variant of the classical domination, defined by means of a so-called Roman domination function $f\colon V(G)\to \{0,1,2\}$ such that if $f(v)=0$ then, the vertex $v$ is adjacent to at least one vertex $w$ with $f(w)=2$. The weight $f(G)$ of a Roman dominating function of $G$ is the sum of the weights of all vertices of $G$, that is, $f(G)=\sum_{u\in V(G)}f(u)$. The Roman domination number $\gamma_R(G)$ is the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function of $G$. In this paper we propose algorithms to compute this parameter involving the $(\min,+)$ powers of large matrices with high computational requirements and the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) allows us to accelerate such operations. Specific routines have been developed to efficiently compute the $(\min ,+)$ product on GPU architecture, taking advantage of its computational power. These algorithms allow us to compute the Roman domination number of cylindrical graphs $P_m\Box C_n$ i.e., the Cartesian product of a path and a cycle, in cases $m=7,8,9$, $ n\geq 3$ and $m\geq $10$, n\equiv 0\pmod 5$. Moreover, we provide a lower bound for the remaining cases $m\geq 10, n\not\equiv 0\pmod 5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the quadratic embedding constant for complete bipartite graphs with disjoint edges removed. Moreover, we study the quadratic embedding property for theta graphs, i.e., graphs consisting of three paths with common initial points and common endpoints. As a result, we provide an infinite family of primary graphs which are not quadratically embeddable.</description>

      <title>Spectral Tur\'an problem for hypergraphs with bipartite or multipartite pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General criteria on spectral extremal problems for hypergraphs were developed by Keevash, Lenz, and Mubayi in their seminal work (SIAM J. Discrete Math., 2014), in which extremal results on \alpha-spectral radius of hypergraphs for \alpha&gt;1 may be deduced from the corresponding hypergraph Tur\'an problem which has the stability property and whose extremal construction satisfies some continuity assumptions. Using this criterion, we give two general spectral Tur\'an results for hypergraphs with bipartite or mulitpartite pattern, transform corresponding the spectral Tur\'an problems into pure combinatorial problems with respect to degree-stability of a nondegenerate k-graph family. As an application, we determine the maximum \alpha-spectral radius for some classes of hypergraphs and characterize the corresponding extremal hypergraphs, such as the expansion of complete graphs, the generalized Fans, the cancellative hypergraphs, the generalized triangles, and a special book hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Forest Cuts in Sparse Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the conjecture that every graph $G$ of order $n$ with less than $3n-6$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest. Maximal planar graphs do not have such vertex cuts and show that the density condition would be best possible. We verify the conjecture for planar graphs and show that every graph $G$ of order $n$ with less than $\frac{11}{5}n-\frac{18}{5}$ edges has a vertex cut that induces a forest.</description>

      <title>The hitting time of nice factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $r \ge 3 $, let $n$ be divisible by $r$ and consider the random graph process on $n$ vertices. It was shown recently that in the random graph process, as soon as every vertex is covered by a copy of the complete graph $K_r$, a $K_r$-factor exists with high probability (RSA, Vol. 65 II, Sept. 2024). We prove an analogous hitting time result for all so-called \textit{nice} (hyper-)graphs in the random (hyper-)graph process. The latter is the class of hypergraphs for which the coupling of Oliver Riordan (RSA, Vol. 61 IV, Dec. 2022) is available, and it includes all $u$-uniform strictly $1$-balanced and $3$-connected hypergraphs for $u\ge 3$. Based on Riordan's coupling, our proof leverages a series of further couplings that connect the random $r$-uniform hypergraph process to the random (hyper-)graph process of interest, and then harnesses Jeff Kahn's hitting time result for the hypergraph process (Trans. Am. Math. Soc., 375, July 2021). The main result showcases that the proof concept of (RSA, Vol. 65 II, Sept. 2024) is a general-purpose tool that can translate sharp threshold results from Riordan's coupling to hitting time results.</description>

      <title>Transforming Stacks into Queues: Mixed and Separated Layouts of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the most important open problems for linear layouts of graphs ask for the relation between a graph's queue number and its stack number or mixed number. In such, we seek a vertex order and edge partition of $G$ into parts with pairwise non-crossing edges (a stack) or with pairwise non-nesting edges (a queue). Allowing only stacks, only queues, or both, the minimum number of required parts is the graph's stack number $sn(G)$, queue number $qn(G)$, and mixed number $mn(G)$, respectively.
  Already in 1992, Heath and Rosenberg asked whether $qn(G)$ is bounded in terms of $sn(G)$, that is, whether stacks "can be transformed into" queues. This is equivalent to bipartite $3$-stack graphs having bounded queue number (Dujmovi\'c and Wood, 2005). Recently, Alam et al. asked whether $qn(G)$ is bounded in terms of $mn(G)$, which we show to also be equivalent to the previous questions.
  We approach the problem from a new angle by considering separated linear layouts of bipartite graphs. In this natural setting all vertices of one part must precede all vertices of the other part. While separated stack and queue numbers coincide, and graphs with bounded separated stack/queue number can be characterized and efficiently recognized, the separated mixed layouts are more challenging. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the relationship between separated and non-separated, mixed and pure linear layouts.</description>

      <title>Hook-length Formulas for Skew Shapes via Contour Integrals and Vertex Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of standard Young tableaux of a skew shape $\lambda/\mu$ can be computed as a sum over excited diagrams inside $\lambda$. Excited diagrams are in bijection with certain lozenge tilings, with flagged semistandard tableaux and also nonintersecting lattice paths inside $\lambda$. We give two new proofs of a multivariate generalization of this formula, which allow us to extend the setup beyond standard Young tableaux and the underlying Schur symmetric polynomials. The first proof uses multiple contour integrals. The second one interprets excited diagrams as configurations of a six-vertex model at a free fermion point, and derives the formula for the number of standard Young tableaux of a skew shape from the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>On factorisations of Left dead ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Losing a game is difficult. Recent work of Larsson, Nowakowski, and Santos, as well as that of Siegel, has opened up enticing lines of research into partizan mis\`ere theory. The algebraic structure of mis\`ere monoids is not yet well understood. A natural object to study is a universe of games, which is a set of games satisfying various closure properties. We prove that a universe is determined by its Left ends, thus motivating a study of such games, which was also noted by Siegel for dead ending universes in particular. We initiate this study by investigating the atomic structure of the monoid of Left dead ends, showing that it is reduced, pocancellative, and an FF-monoid. We give sharp bounds on the lengths of factorisations, and also build tools to find atoms. Some results require the introduction of a new concept called flexibility, which is a measure of the distance from a game to integers. We also discover large families of games admitting unique factorisations; this includes the uncovering of a prime element: $\overline{1}$.</description>

      <title>Extremal number of arborescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following extremal graph theoretic problem: Given an undirected Eulerian graph $G$, which Eulerian orientation minimizes or maximizes the number of arborescences? We solve the minimization for the complete graph $K_n$, the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,m}$, and for the so-called double graphs, where there are even number of edges between any pair of vertices.
  In fact, for $K_n$ we prove the following stronger statement. If $T$ is a tournament on $n$ vertices with out-degree sequence $d_1^+,\dots ,d^+_n$, then $$\mathrm{allarb}(T)\geq \frac{1}{n}\left(\prod_{k=1}^n(d^+_k+1)+\prod_{k=1}^nd^+_k\right),$$ where $\mathrm{allarb}(T)$ is the total number of arborescences. Equality holds if and only if $T$ is a locally transitive tournament.
  We also give an upper bound for the number of arborescences of an Eulerian orientation for an arbitrary graph $G$. This upper bound can be achieved on $K_n$ for infinitely many $n$.</description>

Abstract: For a graph $G$ let $\varepsilon(G)$ denote the number of Eulerian orientations, and $v(G)$ denote the number of vertices of $G$. We show that if $(G_n)_n$ is a sequence of Eulerian graphs that are convergent in Benjamini--Schramm sense, then $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\frac{1}{v(G_n)}\ln \varepsilon(G_n)$ is convergent.</description>

      <title>Interval edge-colorings of Cartesian products of graphs II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An \emph{interval $t$-coloring} of a graph $G$ is a proper edge-coloring with colors $1,\dots,t$ such that the colors on the edges incident to every vertex of $G$ are colored by consecutive colors. A graph $G$ is called \emph{interval colorable} if it has an interval $t$-coloring for some positive integer $t$. Let $\mathfrak{N}$ be the set of all interval colorable graphs. For a graph $G\in \mathfrak{N}$, we denote by $w(G)$ and $W(G)$ the minimum and maximum number of colors in an interval coloring of a graph $G$, respectively. In this paper we present some new sharp bounds on $W(G\square H)$ for graphs $G$ and $H$ satisfying various conditions. In particular, we show that if $G,H\in \mathfrak{N}$ and $H$ is an $r$-regular graph, then $W(G\square H)\geq W(G)+W(H)+r$. We also derive a new upper bound on $W(G)$ for interval colorable connected graphs with additional distance conditions. Based on these bounds, we improve known lower and upper bounds on $W(C_{2n_{1}}\square C_{2n_{2}}\square\cdots \square C_{2n_{k}})$ for $k$-dimensional tori $C_{2n_{1}}\square C_{2n_{2}}\square\cdots \square C_{2n_{k}}$ and on $W(K_{2n_{1}}\square K_{2n_{2}}\square\cdots \square K_{2n_{k}})$ for Hamming graphs $K_{2n_{1}}\square K_{2n_{2}}\square\cdots \square K_{2n_{k}}$, and these new bounds coincide with each other for hypercubes. Finally, we give several results on interval colorings of Fibonacci cubes $\Gamma_{n}$.</description>

      <title>Kernelization Complexity of Solution Discovery Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the solution discovery variant of a vertex (edge) subset problem $\Pi$ on graphs, we are given an initial configuration of tokens on the vertices (edges) of an input graph $G$ together with a budget $b$. The question is whether we can transform this configuration into a feasible solution of $\Pi$ on $G$ with at most $b$ modification steps. We consider the token sliding variant of the solution discovery framework, where each modification step consists of sliding a token to an adjacent vertex (edge). The framework of solution discovery was recently introduced by Fellows et al. [Fellows et al., ECAI 2023] and for many solution discovery problems the classical as well as the parameterized complexity has been established. In this work, we study the kernelization complexity of the solution discovery variants of Vertex Cover, Independent Set, Dominating Set, Shortest Path, Matching, and Vertex Cut with respect to the parameters number of tokens $k$, discovery budget $b$, as well as structural parameters such as pathwidth.</description>

      <title>The submonoid and rational subset membership problems for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the submonoid membership problem and the rational subset membership problem are equivalent in Artin groups. Both these problem are undecidable in a given Artin group if and only if the group embeds the right-angled Artin groups of rank 4 over a path or a square; and this can be characterized using only the defining graph of the Artin group. These results generalize the ones by Lohrey - Steinberg for right-angled Artin groups. Moreover, both these decision problems are decidable for a given Artin group if and only if the group is subgroup separable. This equivalence for right-angled Artin groups is provided by Lohrey - Steinberg and Metaftsis - Raptis. The equivalence for general Artin groups comes from some observations here and the characterization of separable Artin groups by Almeida - Lima.</description>

Abstract: We study real and positive tropicalizations of the varieties of low rank symmetric matrices over real or complex Puiseux series. We show that real tropicalization coincides with complex tropicalization for rank two and corank one cases. We also show that the two notions of positive tropicalization introduced by Speyer and Williams coincide for symmetric rank two matrices, but they differ for symmetric corank one matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The garbage disposal game involves a finite set of individuals, each of whom updates their garbage by either receiving from or dumping onto others. We examine the case where only social neighbors, whose garbage levels differ by a given threshold, can offload an equal proportion of their garbage onto others. Remarkably, in the absence of this threshold, the garbage amounts of all individuals converge to the initial average on any connected social graph that is not a star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of the domination-type parameters is a challenging problem in Cartesian product graphs. We present an algorithmic method to compute the $2$-domination number of the Cartesian product of a path with small order and any cycle, involving the $(\min,+)$ matrix product. We establish some theoretical results that provide the algorithms necessary to compute that parameter, and the main challenge to run such algorithms comes from the large size of the matrices used, which makes it necessary to improve the techniques to handle these objects. We analyze the performance of the algorithms on modern multicore CPUs and on GPUs and we show the advantages over the sequential implementation. The use of these platforms allows us to compute the $2$-domination number of cylinders such that their paths have at most $12$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Precision Asymptotics for Partitions Featuring False-Indefinite Theta Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Andrews-Dyson-Hickerson, Cohen build a striking relation between q-hypergeometric series, real quadratic fields, and Maass forms. Thanks to the works of Lewis-Zagier and Zwegers we have a complete understanding on the part of these relations pertaining to Maass forms and false-indefinite theta functions. In particular, we can systematically distinguish and study the class of false-indefinite theta functions related to Maass forms. A crucial component here is the framework of mock Maass theta functions built by Zwegers in analogy with his earlier work on indefinite theta functions and their application to Ramanujan's mock theta functions. Given this understanding, a natural question is to what extent one can utilize modular properties to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the associated Fourier coefficients, especially in view of their relevance to combinatorial objects. In this paper, we develop the relevant methods to study such a question and show that quite detailed results can be obtained on the asymptotic development, which also enable Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher type exact formulas under the right conditions. We develop these techniques by concentrating on a concrete example involving partitions with parts separated by parity and derive an asymptotic expansion that includes all the exponentially growing terms.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families of polynomials over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an analog of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem to polynomial rings over finite fields, affirmatively answering a conjecture of C. Tompkins.
  A $k$-uniform family of subsets of a set of finite size $n$ is $l$-intersecting if any two subsets in the family intersect in at least $l$ elements. The study of such intersecting families is a core subject of extremal set theory, tracing its roots to the seminal 1961 Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem, which establishes a sharp upper bound on the size of these families.
  As an analog of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem, we determine the largest possible size of a family of monic polynomials, each of degree $n$, over a finite field $F_q$, where every pair of polynomials in the family shares a common factor of degree at least $l$. We establish that the upper bound for this size is $q^{n-l}$ and further characterize all extremal families that achieve this maximum size.
  Further extending our study to triple-intersecting families, where every triplet of polynomials shares a common factor of degree at least $l$, we prove that only trivial families achieve the corresponding upper bound. Moreover, by relaxing the conditions to include polynomials of degree at most $n$, we affirm that the same upper bound holds and only trivial families achieve the corresponding upper bound.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Hardness for $k$-Set Packing and $k$-Matroid Intersection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we prove that $k$-Dimensional Matching is hard to approximate within a factor of $k/(12 + \varepsilon)$ for large $k$ unless $\textsf{NP} \subseteq \textsf{BPP}$. Listed in Karp's 21 $\textsf{NP}$-complete problems, $k$-Dimensional Matching is a benchmark computational complexity problem which we find as a special case of many constrained optimization problems over independence systems including: $k$-Set Packing, $k$-Matroid Intersection, and Matroid $k$-Parity. For all the aforementioned problems, the best known lower bound was a $\Omega(k /\log(k))$-hardness by Hazan, Safra, and Schwartz. In contrast, state-of-the-art algorithms achieved an approximation of $O(k)$. Our result narrows down this gap to a constant and thus provides a rationale for the observed algorithmic difficulties. The crux of our result hinges on a novel approximation preserving gadget from $R$-degree bounded $k$-CSPs over alphabet size $R$ to $kR$-Dimensional Matching. Along the way, we prove that $R$-degree bounded $k$-CSPs over alphabet size $R$ are hard to approximate within a factor $\Omega_k(R)$ using known randomised sparsification methods for CSPs.</description>

Abstract: Totally proper quivers, introduced by S.~Fomin and the author arXiv:2406.03604, have many useful properties including powerful mutation invariants. We show that every mutation-acyclic quiver (i.e., a quiver that is mutation equivalent to an acyclic one) is totally proper. This yields new necessary conditions for a quiver to be mutation-acyclic.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $p=O(1/n)$, then the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p)$ with high probability admits a canonical labeling computable in time $O(n\log n)$. Combined with the previous results on the canonization of random graphs, this implies that $G(n,p)$ with high probability admits a polynomial-time canonical labeling whatever the edge probability function $p$. Our algorithm combines the standard color refinement routine with simple post-processing based on the classical linear-time tree canonization. Noteworthy, our analysis of how well color refinement performs in this setting allows us to complete the description of the automorphism group of the 2-core of $G(n,p)$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a geometric method to study additive combinatorial problems. Using equivariant cohomology we reprove the Dias da Silva-Hamidoune theorem. We improve a result of Sun on the linear extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Heilbronn conjecture. We generalize a theorem of G. K\'os (the Grashopper problem) which in some sense is a simultaneous generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Heilbronn conjecture. We also prove a signed version of the Erd\H{o}s-Heilbronn conjecture and the Grashopper problem. Most identities used are based on calculating the projective degree of an algebraic variety in two different ways.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study pattern avoidance for stabilized-interval-free (SIF) permutations. These permutations are contained in the set of indecomposable permutations and in the set of derangements. We enumerate pattern-avoiding SIF permutations for classical and pairs of patterns of size 3. In particular, for the patterns 123 and 231, we rely on combinatorial arguments and the fixed-point distribution of general permutations avoiding these patterns. We briefly discuss 123-avoiding permutations with two fixed points and offer a conjecture for their enumeration by the distance between their fixed points. For the pattern 231, we also give a direct argument that uses a bijection to ordered forests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph G, a colouring is an assignment of colours to the vertices of G so that no two adjacent vertices are coloured the same. If all colour classes have size at most t, then we call the colouring t-bounded, and the t-bounded chromatic number of G, denoted by $\chi_t(G)$, is the minimum number of colours in such a colouring. Every colouring of G is then $\alpha(G)$-bounded, where $\alpha(G)$ denotes the size of a largest independent set.
  We study colourings of the random graph G(n, 1/2) and of the corresponding uniform random graph G(n,m) with $m=\left \lfloor \frac 12 {n \choose 2} \right \rfloor$. We show that $\chi_t(G(n,m))$ is maximally concentrated on at most two explicit values for $t = \alpha(G(n,m))-2$. This behaviour stands in stark contrast to that of the normal chromatic number, which was recently shown not to be concentrated on any sequence of intervals of length $n^{1/2-o(1)}$. Moreover, when $t = \alpha(G_{n, 1/2})-1$ and if the expected number of independent sets of size $t$ is not too small, we determine an explicit interval of length $n^{0.99}$ that contains $\chi_t(G_{n,1/2})$ with high probability. Both results have profound consequences: the former is at the core of the intriguing Zigzag Conjecture on the distribution of $\chi(G_{n, 1/2})$ and justifies one of its main hypotheses, while the latter is an important ingredient in the proof of a non-concentration result for $\chi(G_{n,1/2})$ that is conjectured to be optimal.
  These two results are consequences of a more general statement. We consider a class of colourings that we call tame, and provide tight bounds for the probability of existence of such colourings via a delicate second moment argument. We then apply those bounds to the two aforementioned cases. As a further consequence of our main result, we prove two-point concentration of the equitable chromatic number of G(n,m).</description>

      <title>The maximum number of connected sets in regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve the best known lower bounds on the exponential behavior of the maximum of the number of connected sets, $N(G)$, and dominating connected sets, $N_{dom}(G)$, for regular graphs. These lower bounds are improved by constructing a family of graphs defined in terms of a small base graph (a Moore graph), using a combinatorial reduction of these graphs to rectangular boards followed by using linear algebra to show that the lower bound is related to the largest eigenvalue of a coefficient matrix associated with the base graph. We also determine the exact maxima of $N(G)$ and $N_{dom}(G)$ for cubic and quartic graphs of small order. We give multiple results in favor of a conjecture that each Moore graph $M$ maximizes the base indicating the exponential behavior of the number of connected vertex subsets among graphs with at least $|M|$ vertices and the same regularity. We improve the best known upper bounds for $N(G)$ and $N_{dom}(G)$ conditional on this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new lower bound on the Bowen-Radin maximal density of radius-R ball packings in the m-dimensional hyperbolic space, improving on the basic covering bound by factor \Omega(m(R+\ln m)) as m tends to infinity. This is done by applying the recent theorem of Campos, Jenssen, Michelen and Sahasrabudhe on independent sets in graphs with sparse neighbourhoods.</description>

      <title>On Oriented Diameter of Power Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the oriented diameter of power graphs of groups. We show that a $2$-edge connected power graph of a finite group has oriented diameter at most $4$. We prove that the power graph of a cyclic group of order $n$ has oriented diameter $2$ for all $n\neq 2,4,6$. Until our work, to the best of our knowledge, no infinite family of graphs with oriented diameter 2 had been identified except for subclasses of complete graphs. Finally, we give a complete characterization of the oriented diameter of the power graphs of nilpotent groups. This, in turn, gives an algorithm for computing the oriented diameter of the power graph of a given nilpotent group that runs in time polynomial in the size of the group.</description>

      <title>Extremal values for the square energies of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ non-isolated vertices and $m$ edges. The positive / negative square energies of $G$, denoted $s^+(G)$ / $s^-(G)$, are defined as the sum of squares of the positive / negative eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of $G$. In this work, we provide several new tools for studying square energy encompassing semi-definite optimization, graph operations, and surplus. Using our tools, we prove the following results on the extremal values of $s^{\pm}(G)$ with a given number of vertices and edges.
  1. We have $\min(s^+(G), s^-(G)) \geq n - \gamma \geq \frac{n}{2}$, where $\gamma$ is the domination number of $G$. This verifies a conjecture of Elphick, Farber, Goldberg and Wocjan up to a constant, and proves a weaker version of this conjecture introduced by Elphick and Linz.
  2. We have $s^+(G) \geq m^{6/7 - o(1)}$ and $s^-(G) = \Omega(m^{1/2})$, with both exponents being optimal.</description>

      <title>On Relaxation of Dominant Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a graph $G = (V,E)$, a k-ruling set $S$ is one in which all vertices $V$ \ $S$ are at most $k$ distance from $S$. Finding a minimum k-ruling set is intrinsically linked to the minimum dominating set problem and maximal independent set problem, which have been extensively studied in graph theory. This paper presents the first known algorithm for solving all k-ruling set problems in conjunction with known minimum dominating set algorithms at only additional polynomial time cost compared to a minimum dominating set. The algorithm further succeeds for $(\alpha, \alpha - 1)$ ruling sets in which $\alpha &gt; 1$, for which constraints exist on the proximity of vertices v $\in S$. This secondary application instead works in conjunction with maximal independent set algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite dimensional algebra $A$, the notion of $g$-fan $\Sigma(A)$ is defined from two-term silting complexes of $A$ in the real Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathsf{proj} A)_{\mathbb{R}}$. In this paper, we discuss the theory of shards to $\Sigma(A)$, which was originally defined for a hyperplane arrangement. We establish a correspondence between the set of join-irreducible elements of the poset of torsion classes of $\mathrm{mod} A$ and the set of shards of $\Sigma(A)$ for $g$-finite algebra $A$. Moreover, we show that the semistable region of a brick of $\mathrm{mod} A$ is exactly given by a shard. We also give a poset isomorphism of shard intersections and wide subcategories of $\mathrm{mod} A$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study alternating links in thickened surfaces in terms of the lattices of integer flows on their Tait graphs. We use this approach to give a short proof of the first two generalised Tait conjectures. We also prove that the flow lattice is an invariant of alternating links in thickened surfaces and is further invariant under disc mutation. For classical links, the flow lattice and $d$-invariants are complete invariants of the mutation class of an alternating link. For links in thickened surfaces, we show that this is no longer the case by finding a stronger mutation invariant, namely the Gordon-Litherland linking form. In particular, we find alternating knots in thickened surfaces which have isometric flow lattices but with non-isomorphic linking forms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08757v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>

Abstract: Graph independence (also known as $\epsilon$-independence or $\lambda$-independence) is a mixture of classical independence and free independence corresponding to graph products or groups and operator algebras. Using conjugation by certain random permutation matrices, we construct random matrix models for graph independence with amalgamation over the diagonal matrices. This yields a new probabilist,ic proof that graph products of sofic groups are sofic.</description>

      <title>Solving the Graph Burning Problem for Large Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an exact algorithm for the Graph Burning Problem ($\texttt{GBP}$), an NP-hard optimization problem that models the spread of influence on social networks. Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, the objective is to find a sequence of $k$ vertices in $V$, namely, $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$, such that $k$ is minimum and $\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k} \{u\! \in\! V\! : d(u, v_i) \leq k - i\} = V$, where $d(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$. We formulate the problem as a set covering integer programming model and design a row generation algorithm for the $\texttt{GBP}$. Our method exploits the fact that a very small number of covering constraints is often sufficient for solving the integer model, allowing the corresponding rows to be generated on demand. To date, the most efficient exact algorithm for the $\texttt{GBP}$, denoted here by $\texttt{GDCA}$, is able to obtain optimal solutions for graphs with up to 14,000 vertices within two hours of execution. In comparison, our algorithm finds provably optimal solutions approximately 236 times faster, on average, than $\texttt{GDCA}$. For larger graphs, memory space becomes a limiting factor for $\texttt{GDCA}$. Our algorithm, however, solves real-world instances with almost 200,000 vertices in less than 35 seconds, increasing the size of graphs for which optimal solutions are known by a factor of 14.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The comma sequence (1, 12, 35, 94, ...) is the lexicographically earliest sequence such that the difference of consecutive terms equals the concatenation of the digits on either side of the comma separating them. The behavior of a "generalized comma sequence" depends on the base the numbers are written in, as well as the sequence's initial values. We provide a computational proof that all comma sequences in bases 3 through 633 are finite. Relying on a combinatorial conjecture, Angelini et al. estimated that the final element of a comma sequence in base b should be roughly exp(O(b)). We prove their conjecture, but provide evidence that the correct estimate is actually exp(O(b log b)).</description>

      <title>Completing the proof of the Liebeck--Nikolov--Shalev conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liebeck, Nikolov, and Shalev conjectured the existence of an absolute constant $C&gt;0$, such that for every subset $A$ of a finite simple group $G$ with $|A|\ge 2$, there exists $C\log|G|/\log|A|$ conjugates of $A$ whose product is $G$. This paper is a companion to \cite{GLPS}, and together they prove the conjecture.
  To prove the conjecture, we establish the following skew-product theorem. We show that there exists $ c &gt; 0 $ such that for all $ \epsilon &gt; 0 $ and subsets $ A, B \subseteq G $ of finite simple groups of Lie type, if $ |B| &lt; |G|^{1 - \epsilon} $, then $ |A^{\sigma} B| &gt; |B||A|^{c \epsilon} $ for some $ \sigma \in G $. This result, along with its more involved analogue for alternating groups, constitutes the main contribution of this paper.
  Our proof leverages deep results from character theory alongside the probabilistic method.</description>

      <title>Fixation of leadership in non-Markovian growth processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a model where $N$ equal agents possess `values', belonging to $\mathbb{N}_0$, that are subject to incremental growth over time. More precisely, the values of the agents are represented by $N$ independent, increasing $\mathbb{N}_0$ valued processes with random, independent waiting times between jumps. We show that the event that a single agent possesses the maximum value for all sufficiently large values of time (called `leadership') occurs with probability zero or one, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for this to occur. Under mild conditions we also provide criteria for a single agent to become the unique agent of maximum value for all sufficiently large times, and also conditions for the emergence of a unique agent having value that tends to infinity before `explosion' occurs (i.e. conditions for `strict leadership' or `monopoly' to occur almost surely). The novelty of this model lies in allowing non-exponentially distributed waiting times between jumps in value. In the particular case when waiting times are mixtures of exponential distributions, we improve a well-established result on the `balls in bins' model with feedback, removing the requirement that the feedback function be bounded from below and also allowing random feedback functions. As part of the proofs we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the distribution of a convergent series of independent random variables to have an atom on the real line, a result which we believe may be of interest in its own right.</description>
