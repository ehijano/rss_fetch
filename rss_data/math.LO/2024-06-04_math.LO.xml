      <title>Multiplicative logic in arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article explores the arithmetic of multiplication as a model of many valued projective logic. It is demonstrated that closed numerical intervals within this framework constitute Heyting algebras. The conditions for these algebras to be Boolean are identified. The article claims have undergone numerical verification. Paths for generalization to normed linear spaces are delineated.</description>

      <title>Independence Phenomena in Mathematics: a Set Theoretic Perspective on Current Obstacles and Scenarios for Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard axioms of set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (ZFC), do not suffice to answer all questions in mathematics. While this follows abstractly from Kurt G\"odel's famous incompleteness theorems, we nowadays know numerous concrete examples for such questions. A large number of problems in set theory, for example, regularity properties such as Lebesgue measurability and the Baire property are not decided - for even rather simple (for example, projective) sets of reals - by ZFC. Even many problems outside of set theory have been showed to be unsolvable, meaning neither their truth nor their failure can be proven from ZFC. A major part of set theory is devoted to attacking this problem by studying various extensions of ZFC and their properties. We outline some of these extensions and explain current obstacles in understanding their impact on the set theoretical universe together with recent progress on these questions and future scenarios. This work is related to the overall goal to identify the "right" axioms for mathematics.</description>

      <title>Definable convolution and idempotent Keisler measures III. Generic stability, generic transitivity, and revised Newelski's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study idempotent measures and the structure of the convolution semigroups of measures over definable groups. We isolate the property of generic transitivity and demonstrate that it is sufficient (and necessary) to develop stable group theory localizing on a generically stable type, including invariant stratified ranks and connected components. We establish generic transitivity of generically stable idempotent types in important new cases, including abelian groups in arbitrary theories and arbitrary groups in rosy theories, and characterize them as generics of connected type-definable subgroups. Using tools from Keisler's randomization theory, we generalize some of these results from types to generically stable Keisler measures, and classify idempotent generically stable measures in abelian groups as (unique) translation-invariant measures on type-definable fsg subgroups. This provides a partial definable counterpart to the classical work of Rudin, Cohen and Pym for locally compact topological groups. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of a minimal left ideal in the convolution semigroup of measures for an arbitrary countable NIP group, from a minimal left ideal in the corresponding semigroup on types and a canonical measure constructed on its ideal subgroup. In order to achieve it, we in particular prove the revised Ellis group conjecture of Newelski for countable NIP groups.</description>

      <title>A Reverse Mathematical Analysis of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and Basis Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an expository reverse-mathematical analysis of two fundamental theorems in commutative algebra: Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and Basis Theorem. In addition to its profound significance in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, the Basis Theorem is also historically notable for its nonconstructive proof. The Nullstellensatz, on the other hand, is noteworthy as it establishes a fundamental connection between the more algebraic notion of ideals and the more geometric notion of varieties.
  We explore the conscious shift from computational to conceptual approaches in mathematical argumentation, contextualizing Hilbert's contributions. We formalize the relative constructivity of these theorems using the framework of reverse mathematics, although we do not presuppose familiarity with reverse mathematics. Drawing from contemporary mathematical literature, we analyze the Basis Theorem's reliance on nonconstructive methods versus the more constructive nature of the Nullstellensatz.
  Our study employs the standard tools of reverse mathematics, in particular subsystems of second-order arithmetic, to outline the minimal set-existence axioms required for these theorems. We review results showing that certain formulations of the Nullstellensatz are provable in the weak axiom system of $\mathsf{RCA}_0$, while the Basis Theorem requires stronger axioms, such as $\Sigma^0_2$-Induction. Consequently, we position these theorems separately within the Friedman-Simpson hierarchy. This analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the foundational requirements for these pivotal results in algebra.</description>

      <title>Lang-Weil Type Estimates in Finite Difference Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a uniform estimate of the number of points for difference algebraic varieties in finite difference fields in the spirit of Lang-Weil. More precisely, we give uniform lower and upper bounds for the number of rational points of a difference variety in terms of its transformal dimension. As a main technical ingredient, we prove an equidimensionality result for Frobenius reductions of difference varieties.</description>

      <title>On n-dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:1411.0120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we develop and clarify some of the basic combinatorial properties of the new notion of $n$-dependence (for $1\leq n &lt; \omega$) recently introduced by Shelah. In the same way as dependence of a theory means its inability to encode a bipartite random graph with a definable edge relation, $n$-dependence corresponds to the inability to encode a random $(n+1)$-partite $(n+1)$-hypergraph with a definable edge relation. Most importantly, we characterize $n$-dependence by counting $\varphi$-types over finite sets (generalizing Sauer-Shelah lemma and answering a question of Shelah) and in terms of the collapse of random ordered $(n+1)$-hypergraph indiscernibles down to order-indiscernibles (which implies that the failure of $n$-dependence is always witnessed by a formula in a single free variable).</description>

      <title>The consistency strength of determinacy when all sets are universally Baire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.04244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the large cardinal strength of the Axiom of Determinacy when enhanced with the hypothesis that all sets of reals are universally Baire is much stronger than the Axiom of Determinacy itself. Sargsyan conjectured it to be as strong as the existence of a cardinal that is both a limit of Woodin cardinals and a limit of strong cardinals. Larson, Sargsyan and Wilson used a generalization of Woodin's derived model construction to show that this conjectured result would be optimal. In this paper we introduce a new translation procedure for hybrid mice extending work of Steel, Zhu and Sargsyan and apply it to prove Sargsyan's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Many-one reducibility with realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new classification of $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas under the realizability interpretation of many-one reducibility (i.e., Levin reducibility). For example, ${\sf Fin}$, the decision of being eventually zero for sequences, is many-one/Levin complete among $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas of the form $\exists n\forall m\geq n.\varphi(m,x)$, where $\varphi$ is decidable. The decision of boundedness for sequences ${\sf BddSeq}$ and for width of posets ${\sf FinWidth}$ are many-one/Levin complete among $\Sigma^0_2$ formulas of the form $\exists n\forall m\geq n\forall k.\varphi(m,k,x)$, where $\varphi$ is decidable. However, unlike the classical many-one reducibility, none of the above is $\Sigma^0_2$-complete. The decision of non-density of linear order ${\sf NonDense}$ is truly $\Sigma^0_2$-complete.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Randomness, Effective Disintegrations, and Rates of Convergence to the Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: L\'evy's Upward Theorem says that the conditional expectation of an integrable random variable converges with probability one to its true value with increasing information. In this paper, we use methods from effective probability theory to characterise the probability one set along which convergence to the truth occurs, and the rate at which the convergence occurs. We work within the setting of computable probability measures defined on computable Polish spaces and introduce a new general theory of effective disintegrations. We use this machinery to prove our main results, which (1) identify the points along which certain classes of effective random variables converge to the truth in terms of certain classes of algorithmically random points, and which further (2) identify when computable rates of convergence exist. Our convergence results significantly generalize earlier results within a unifying novel abstract framework, and there are no precursors of our results on computable rates of convergence. Finally, we make a case for the importance of our work for the foundations of Bayesian probability theory.</description>

      <title>Higher geometric sheaf theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a higher covering diagram in a base $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$. The theory of higher covering diagrams in $\mathcal{C}$ will be shown to recover various descent conditions known from the $\infty$-categorical literature in a uniform manner. In fact, higher covering diagrams always assemble to what we refer to as a structured colimit pre-topology on the base $\mathcal{C}$. It hence always defines a sub-canonical sheaf theory over $\mathcal{C}$, and indeed defines the canonical such whenever $\mathcal{C}$ has pullbacks. This ``higher geometric'' sheaf theory will be shown to differ from the usual infinitary-coherent sheaf theory by a cotopological localization whenever $\mathcal{C}$ is infinitary-coherent itself. We prove that this localization is generally non-trivial. For instance, every $\infty$-topos is the theory of higher geometric sheaves over itself, but the according infinitary-coherent sheaf theory over it is generally strictly larger. The higher geometric sheaves are hence characterized by a limit preservation property that is generally not captured by the classical sheaf condition. We define an $\infty$-category of higher geometric $\infty$-categories, and show that the (opposite of the) $\infty$-category of $\infty$-toposes embeds fully faithfully therein. We show that the higher $\kappa$-geometric sheaf theory on a higher $\kappa$-geometric $\infty$-category defines the free $\infty$-topos generated by it, and consequently that it faithfully generalizes Lurie's definition of a ``sheaf'' over an $\infty$-topos.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic automatic complexity of finite strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13376v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new complexity measure for finite strings using probabilistic finite-state automata (PFAs), in the same spirit as existing notions employing DFAs and NFAs, and explore its properties. The PFA complexity $A_P(x)$ is the least number of states of a PFA for which $x$ is the most likely string of its length to be accepted. The variant $A_{P,\delta}(x)$ adds a real-valued parameter $\delta$ specifying a required lower bound on the gap in acceptance probabilities between $x$ and other strings. We prove $A_{P,\delta}$ is $\delta$-computable for all $\delta$, relate $A_P$ to the DFA and NFA complexities, and obtain a complete classification of binary strings with $A_P=2$. Finally, we discuss several other variations on $A_P$ with a view to obtaining additional desirable properties.</description>
