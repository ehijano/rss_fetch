      <title>Policy-Embedded Graph Expansion: Networked HIV Testing with Diffusion-Driven Network Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HIV is a retrovirus that attacks the human immune system and can lead to death without proper treatment. In collaboration with the WHO and Wits University, we study how to improve the efficiency of HIV testing with the goal of eventual deployment, directly supporting progress toward UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.3. While prior work has demonstrated the promise of intelligent algorithms for sequential, network-based HIV testing, existing approaches rely on assumptions that are impractical in our real-world implementations. Here, we study sequential testing on incrementally revealed disease networks and introduce Policy-Embedded Graph Expansion (PEGE), a novel framework that directly embeds a generative distribution over graph expansions into the decision-making policy rather than attempting explicit topological reconstruction. We further propose Dynamics-Driven Branching (DDB), a diffusion-based graph expansion model that supports decision making in PEGE and is designed for data-limited settings where forest structures arise naturally, as in our real-world referral process. Experiments on real HIV transmission networks show that the combined approach (PEGE + DDB) consistently outperforms existing baselines (e.g., 13% improvement in discounted reward and 9% more HIV detections with 25% of the population tested) and explore key tradeoffs that drive decision quality.</description>

      <title>Bringing order to network centrality measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantitative method to compare arbitrary pairs of graph centrality measures, based on the ordering of vertices induced by them. The proposed method is conceptually simple, mathematically elegant, and allows for a quantitative restatement of many conjectures that were previously cumbersome to formalize. Moreover, it produces an approximation scheme useful for network scientists. We explore some of these uses and formulate new conjectures that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy of Community Detection on Signed Networks via Community Refinement and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection (CD) on signed networks is crucial for understanding how positive and negative relations jointly shape network structure. However, existing CD methods often yield inconsistent communities due to noisy or conflicting edge signs. In this paper, we propose ReCon, a model-agnostic post-processing framework that progressively refines community structures through four iterative steps: (1) structural refinement, (2) boundary refinement, (3) contrastive learning, and (4) clustering. Extensive experiments on eighteen synthetic and four real-world networks using four CD methods demonstrate that ReCon consistently enhances community detection accuracy, serving as an effective and easily integrable solution for reliable CD across diverse network properties.</description>

      <title>Segregation Before Polarization: How Recommendation Strategies Shape Echo Chamber Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms facilitate echo chambers through feedback loops between user preferences and recommendation algorithms. While algorithmic homogeneity is well-documented, the distinct evolutionary pathways driven by content-based versus link-based recommendations remain unclear. Using an extended dynamic Bounded Confidence Model (BCM), we show that content-based algorithms--unlike their link-based counterparts--steer social networks toward a segregation-before-polarization (SbP) pathway. Along this trajectory, structural segregation precedes opinion divergence, accelerating individual isolation while delaying but ultimately intensifying collective polarization. Furthermore, we reveal a paradox in information sharing: Reposting increases the number of connections in the network, yet it simultaneously reinforces echo chambers because it amplifies small, latent opinion differences that would otherwise remain inconsequential. These findings suggest that mitigating polarization requires stage-dependent algorithmic interventions, shifting from content-centric to structure-centric strategies as networks evolve.</description>

      <title>D-MODD: A Diffusion Model of Opinion Dynamics Derived from Online Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first empirical derivation of a continuous-time stochastic model for real-world opinion dynamics. Using longitudinal social-media data to infer users opinion on a binary climate-change topic, we reconstruct the underlying drift and diffusion functions governing individual opinion updates. We show that the observed dynamics are well described by a Langevin-type stochastic differential equation, with persistent attractor basins and spatially sensitive drift and diffusion terms. The empirically inferred one-step transition probabilities closely reproduce the transition kernel generated from the D-MODD model we introduce. Our results provide the first direct evidence that online opinion dynamics on a polarized topic admit a Markovian description at the operator level, with empirically reconstructed transition kernels accurately reproduced by a data-driven Langevin model, bridging sociophysics, behavioral data, and complex-systems modeling.</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal, Multinational, and Multilingual Corpus of News Coverage of the Russo-Ukrainian War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DNIPRO, a novel longitudinal corpus of 246K news articles documenting the Russo-Ukrainian war from Feb 2022 to Aug 2024, spanning eleven media outlets across five nation states (Russia, Ukraine, U.S., U.K., and China) and three languages (English, Russian, and Mandarin Chinese). This multilingual resource features consistent and comprehensive metadata, and multiple types of annotation with rigorous human evaluations for downstream tasks relevant to systematic transnational analyses of contentious wartime discourse. DNIPRO's distinctive value lies in its inclusion of competing geopolitical perspectives, making it uniquely suited for studying narrative divergence, media framing, and information warfare. To demonstrate its utility, we include use case experiments using stance detection, sentiment analysis, topical framing, and contradiction analysis of major conflict events within the larger war. Our explorations reveal how outlets construct competing realities, with coverage exhibiting polarized interpretations that reflect geopolitical interests. Beyond supporting computational journalism research, DNIPRO provides a foundational resource for understanding how conflicting narratives emerge and evolve across global information ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Network Security under Heterogeneous Cyber-Risk Profiles and Contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber risk has become a critical financial threat in today's interconnected digital economy. This paper introduces a cyber-risk management framework for networked digital systems that combines the strategic behavior of players with contagion dynamics within a security game. We address the problem of optimally allocating cybersecurity resources across a network, focusing on the heterogeneous valuations of nodes by attackers and defenders, some areas may be of high interest to the attacker, while others are prioritized by the defender. We explore how this asymmetry drives attack and defense strategies and shapes the system's overall resilience. We extend a method to determine optimal resource allocation based on simple network metrics weighted by the defender's and attacker's risk profiles. We further propose risk measures based on contagion paths and analyze how propagation dynamics influence optimal defense strategies. Numerical experiments explore risk versus cost efficient frontiers varying network topologies and risk profiles, revealing patterns of resource allocation and cyber deception effects. These findings provide actionable insights for designing resilient digital infrastructures and mitigating systemic cyber risk.</description>

      <title>Validating Behavioral Proxies for Disease Risk Monitoring via Large-Scale E-commerce Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital traces of daily activities, such as e-commerce (EC) purchase histories, provide scalable signals for public health surveillance, yet their epidemiological validity remains unclear. This study validates a behavioral proxy for disease onset, defined as transitions from regular to therapeutic diets, by comparing large-scale EC data (N=55,645) against independent insurance-derived clinical records. Using feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) as a case study, the proxy showed strong agreement with clinical data for ingredient-level risk patterns (r=0.74) and seasonal dynamics (r=0.82). Furthermore, analysis using EC data alone reproduced the established protective association of wet food consumption. These results demonstrate that validated behavioral signals from EC data can serve as cost-effective complements to traditional surveillance, with potential applicability to monitoring lifestyle-related diseases in human populations.</description>

      <title>Markovian Reeb Graphs for Simulating Spatiotemporal Patterns of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning, epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb Graphs, a novel framework that transforms Reeb graphs from a descriptive analysis tool into a generative model for spatiotemporal trajectories. Our approach captures individual and population-level Patterns of Life (PoLs) and generates realistic trajectories that preserve baseline behaviors while incorporating stochastic variability by embedding probabilistic transitions within the Reeb graph structure. We present two variants: Sequential Reeb Graphs (SRGs) for individual agents and Hybrid Reeb Graphs (HRGs) that combine individual with population PoLs, evaluated on the Urban Anomalies and Geolife datasets using five mobility statistics. Results demonstrate that HRGs achieve strong fidelity across metrics while requiring modest trajectory datasets without specialized side information. This work establishes Markovian Reeb Graphs as a promising framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across urban environments.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Detection of Mental Health Conditions and Cyberbullying from Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.</description>
