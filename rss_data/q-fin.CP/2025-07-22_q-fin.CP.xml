      <title>Alternative Loss Function in Evaluation of Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper design and architecture of testing of machine learning models, especially in their application to quantitative finance problems, is crucial. The most important in this process is selecting an adequate loss function used for training, validation, estimation purposes, and tuning of hyperparameters. Therefore, in this research, through empirical experiments on equity and cryptocurrency assets, we introduce the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL) function which is more adequate for optimizing forecast-generating models used in algorithmic investment strategies. The MADL function results are compared for Transformer and LSTM models and we show that almost in every case Transformer results are significantly better than those obtained with LSTM.</description>

      <title>Binary Tree Option Pricing Under Market Microstructure Effects: A Random Forest Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning-based extension of the classical binomial option pricing model that incorporates key market microstructure effects. Traditional models assume frictionless markets, overlooking empirical features such as bid-ask spreads, discrete price movements, and serial return correlations. Our framework augments the binomial tree with path-dependent transition probabilities estimated via Random Forest classifiers trained on high-frequency market data. This approach preserves no-arbitrage conditions while embedding real-world trading dynamics into the pricing model.
  Using 46,655 minute-level observations of SPY from January to June 2025, we achieve an AUC of 88.25% in forecasting one-step price movements. Order flow imbalance is identified as the most influential predictor, contributing 43.2% to feature importance. After resolving time-scaling inconsistencies in tree construction, our model yields option prices that deviate by 13.79% from Black-Scholes benchmarks, highlighting the impact of microstructure on fair value estimation. While computational limitations restrict the model to short-term derivatives, our results offer a robust, data-driven alternative to classical pricing methods grounded in empirical market behavior.</description>
