      <title>In Vitro Antibacterial activity of hexane, Chloroform and methanolic extracts of different parts of Acronychia pedunculata grown in Sri Lanka</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study accessed the antibacterial potential in vitro of hexane, chloroform and methanol extracts made from leaves, stem bark, flowers, seeds or roots of Sri Lankan grown Acronychia pedunculata plant against two Gram positive bacteria, Staphylococus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Bacilus cereus (ATCC 11778), and two Gram negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), using agar disc diffusion bioassay technique. The results showed that none the of the extracts provoked an antibacterial action against the two Gram negative bacteria P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Conversely, compared to reference drug, Gentamicin, varying magnitudes of antibacterial activity (concentration: 300 mg/disc) ranging from zero to mild to moderate to strong antibacterial activity was evident with the three solvent systems made from different parts of the plant against the two Gram positive bacteria S. aureus and B. cereus. All the three flower extracts excerted marked antibacterial activity against both S. aureus and B. cereus. The highest antibacterial activity was exhibited by methanol flowers extract (inhibition zone: 13.8-0.32mm), with a Minimum inhibitory value of 32mg/ml, against B. cereus. The overall order of potency against S. aureus was, chloroform flowers&gt; chloroform seeds &gt; hexane leaves &gt; chloroform leaves &gt; methanol flowers&gt; hexane flowers&gt; methanol seeds. And against B. cereus was methanol flowers&gt; hexane leaves &gt; hexane flowers&gt; chloroform leaves &gt;chloroform flowers &gt;chloroform seeds &gt; hexane roots &gt; chloroform roots &gt; methanol seeds chloroform stem barks = hexane stem barks. These are all novel findings for A. pedunculata found in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.</description>

      <title>CBTOPE2: An improved method for predicting of conformational B-cell epitopes in an antigen from its primary sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2009, our group pioneered a novel method CBTOPE for predicting conformational B-cell epitopes in a protein from its amino acid sequence, which received extensive citations from the scientific community. In a recent study, Cia et al. (2023) evaluated the performance of conformational B-cell epitope prediction methods on a well-curated dataset, revealing that most approaches, including CBTOPE, exhibited poor performance. One plausible cause of this diminished performance is that available methods were trained on datasets that are both limited in size and outdated in content. In this study, we present an enhanced version of CBTOPE, trained, tested, and evaluated using the well-curated dataset from Cai et al. (2023). Initially, we developed machine learning-based models using binary profiles, achieving a maximum AUC of 0.58 on the validation dataset. The performance of our method improved significantly from an AUC of 0.58 to 0.63 when incorporating evolutionary information in the form of a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) profile. Furthermore, the performance increased from an AUC of 0.63 to 0.64 when we integrated both the PSSM profile and relative solvent accessibility (RSA). All models were trained, tested, and optimized on the training dataset using five-fold cross-validation. The final performance of our models was assessed using a validation or independent dataset that was not used during hyperparameter optimization. To facilitate scientific community working in the field of subunit vaccine, we develop a standalone software and web server CBTOPE2 (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cbtope2/).</description>

      <title>Curriculum Learning for Biological Sequence Prediction: The Case of De Novo Peptide Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptide sequencing-the process of identifying amino acid sequences from mass spectrometry data-is a fundamental task in proteomics. Non-Autoregressive Transformers (NATs) have proven highly effective for this task, outperforming traditional methods. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate tokens sequentially, NATs predict all positions simultaneously, leveraging bidirectional context through unmasked self-attention. However, existing NAT approaches often rely on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, which presents significant optimization challenges due to CTC's complexity and increases the risk of training failures. To address these issues, we propose an improved non-autoregressive peptide sequencing model that incorporates a structured protein sequence curriculum learning strategy. This approach adjusts protein's learning difficulty based on the model's estimated protein generational capabilities through a sampling process, progressively learning peptide generation from simple to complex sequences. Additionally, we introduce a self-refining inference-time module that iteratively enhances predictions using learned NAT token embeddings, improving sequence accuracy at a fine-grained level. Our curriculum learning strategy reduces NAT training failures frequency by more than 90% based on sampled training over various data distributions. Evaluations on nine benchmark species demonstrate that our approach outperforms all previous methods across multiple metrics and species.</description>

      <title>Iterative Annealing Mechanism for Protein and RNA Chaperones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular chaperones are machines that consume copious amount of ATP to drive misfolded proteins or RNA to fold into functionally competent native states. Because the folding landscapes of biomolecules with complex native state topology are rugged consisting of multiple minima that are separated by large free energy barriers, folding occurs by the kinetic partitioning mechanism according to which only a small fraction of the molecules reach the folded state in biologically viable times. The rescue of such proteins and RNA require chaperones. Although the protein and RNA chaperones are profoundly different in their structure and action, the principles underlying their activity to produce the folded structures can be understood using a unified theoretical framework based on iterative annealing mechanism (IAM). Our theory shows that both these machines have evolved to the maximize the production of the steady state yield on biological times. Strikingly, theory predicts that only at a moderate level of RNA chaperone activity is the yield of the self-splicing pre-RNA is maximized in \textit{in vivo}.</description>

      <title>LapDDPM: A Conditional Graph Diffusion Model for scRNA-seq Generation with Spectral Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-fidelity and biologically plausible synthetic single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, especially with conditional control, is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, and complex biological variations. Existing generative models often struggle to capture these unique characteristics and ensure robustness to structural noise in cellular networks. We introduce LapDDPM, a novel conditional Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model for robust and high-fidelity scRNA-seq generation. LapDDPM uniquely integrates graph-based representations with a score-based diffusion model, enhanced by a novel spectral adversarial perturbation mechanism on graph edge weights. Our contributions are threefold: we leverage Laplacian Positional Encodings (LPEs) to enrich the latent space with crucial cellular relationship information; we develop a conditional score-based diffusion model for effective learning and generation from complex scRNA-seq distributions; and we employ a unique spectral adversarial training scheme on graph edge weights, boosting robustness against structural variations. Extensive experiments on diverse scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate LapDDPM's superior performance, achieving high fidelity and generating biologically-plausible, cell-type-specific samples. LapDDPM sets a new benchmark for conditional scRNA-seq data generation, offering a robust tool for various downstream biological applications.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Multimodal Learning for Tumor Protein-Metal Binding: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03847</link>

Abstract: In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern the pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy of drugs, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the ''black box'' nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.</description>
