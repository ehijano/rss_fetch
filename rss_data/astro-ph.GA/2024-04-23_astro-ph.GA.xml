      <title>JWST ERS Program Q3D: The pitfalls of virial BH mass constraints shown in a z = 3 quasar with an ultramassive host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST MIRI/NIRSpec observations of the extremely red quasar SDSS J165202.64+172852.3 at z~3, one of the most luminous quasars known to date, driving powerful outflows and hosting a clumpy starburst, amidst several interacting companions. We estimate the black hole (BH) mass of the system based on the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, as well as the Pa$\beta$ emission in the IR and MgII in the UV. We recover a very broad range of mass estimates, with constraints ranging between log $M_{\rm BH}$=9 and 10.1, which is exacerbated if imposing a uniform BLR geometry at all wavelengths. Several factors may contribute to the large spread: measurement uncertainties (insufficient sensitivity to detect the broadest component of the faint Pa$\beta$ line, spectral blending, ambiguities in the broad/narrow component distinction), lack of virial equilibrium (in a system characterised by powerful outflows and rapid accretion), and uncertainties on the luminosity-inferred size of the broad line region, a.o. given central dust obscuration. We constrain the stellar mass via SED fitting, suggesting the host to be extremely massive at $10^{12.8\pm 0.5} M_\odot$ - ~2 dex above the characteristic mass of the Schechter fit to the z=3 stellar mass function. Notably, J1652's central BH might be interpreted as being either undermassive, overmassive, or in line with the BH mass-stellar mass relation, depending on the choice of assumptions. The recovered Eddington ratio varies accordingly, but exceeds 10% in any case. We put our results into context by providing an extensive overview and discussion of recent literature results and their associated assumptions. Our findings provide an important demonstration of the uncertainties inherent in virial BH mass estimates, which are of particular relevance in the JWST era given the growing number of studies on rapidly accreting quasars at high redshift.</description>

      <title>An Excess of AGNs Triggered by Galaxy Mergers in MaNGA Galaxies of Stellar Mass $\sim10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate new studies of galaxy merger driven fueling of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we present a catalog of 387 AGNs that we have identified in the final population of over $10,000$ $z&lt;0.15$ galaxies observed by the SDSS-IV integral field spectroscopy survey Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA). We selected the AGNs via mid-infrared WISE colors, Swift/BAT ultra hard X-ray detections, NVSS and FIRST radio observations, and broad emission lines in SDSS spectra. By combining the MaNGA AGN catalog with a new SDSS catalog of galaxy mergers that were identified based on a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxies, we study the link between galaxy mergers and nuclear activity for AGNs above a limiting bolometric luminosity of $10^{44.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find an excess of AGNs in mergers, relative to non-mergers, for galaxies with stellar mass $\sim10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, where the AGN excess is somewhat stronger in major mergers than in minor mergers. Further, when we combine minor and major mergers and sort by merger stage, we find that the highest AGN excess occurs in post-coalescence mergers in the highest mass galaxies. However, we find no evidence of a correlation between galaxy mergers and AGN luminosity or accretion rate. In summary, while galaxy mergers overall do appear to trigger or enhance AGN activity more than non-mergers, they do not seem to induce higher levels of accretion or higher luminosities. We provide the MaNGA AGN Catalog and the MaNGA Galaxy Merger Catalog for the community here.</description>

      <title>Stochastic prior for non-parametric star-formation histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of power contained in the variations in galaxy star-formation histories (SFHs) across a range of timescales encodes key information about the physical processes which modulate star formation. Modelling the SFHs of galaxies as stochastic processes allows the relative importance of different timescales to be quantified via the power spectral density (PSD). In this paper, we build upon the PSD framework and develop a physically-motivated, "stochastic" prior for non-parametric SFHs in the spectral energy distribution (SED)-modelling code Prospector. We test this prior in two different regimes: 1) massive, $z = 0.7$ galaxies with both photometry and spectra, analogous to those observed with the LEGA-C survey, and 2) $z = 8$ galaxies with photometry only, analogous to those observed with NIRCam on JWST. We find that it is able to recover key galaxy parameters (e.g. stellar mass, stellar metallicity) to the same level of fidelity as the commonly-used continuity prior. Furthermore, the realistic variability information incorporated by the stochastic SFH model allows it to fit the SFHs of galaxies more accurately and precisely than traditional non-parametric models. In fact, the stochastic prior is $\gtrsim 2\times$ more accurate than the continuity prior in measuring the recent star-formation rates (log SFR$_{100}$ and log SFR$_{10}$) of both the $z = 0.7$ and $z = 8$ mock systems. While the PSD parameters of individual galaxies are difficult to constrain, the stochastic prior implementation presented in this work allows for the development hierarchical models in the future, i.e. simultaneous SED-modelling of an ensemble of galaxies to measure their underlying PSD.</description>

      <title>Death of the Immortal Molecular Cloud: Resolution Dependence of the Gas-Star Formation Relation Rules out Decoupling by Stellar Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have demonstrated that giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are short-lived entities, surviving for the order of a dynamical time before turning a few percent of their mass into stars and dispersing, leaving behind an isolated young stellar population. The key question has been whether this GMC dispersal actually marks a point of GMC destruction by stellar feedback from the new-born stars, or if GMCs might be `immortal' and only dynamically decouple from their nascent stars due to stellar drift. We address this question in six nearby galaxies, by quantifying how the gas-star formation relation depends on the spatial scale for scales between the GMC diameter and the GMC separation length, i.e. the scales where an excess of GMCs would be expected to be found in the stellar drift scenario. Our analysis reveals a consistent dearth of GMCs near young stellar populations regardless of the spatial scale, discounting the notion of `immortal' GMCs that decouple from their nascent stars through stellar drift. Instead, our findings demonstrate that stellar feedback destroys most GMCs at the end of their lifecycle. Employing a variety of statistical techniques to test both hypotheses, we find that the probability that stellar feedback concludes the GMC lifecycle is about 2,000 times higher than the probability that stellar drift separates GMCs and young stellar regions. This observation strengthens the emerging picture that galaxies consist of dynamic building blocks undergoing vigorous, feedback-driven lifecycles that collectively regulate star formation and drive the baryon cycle within galaxies.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. III. A Census of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the third Data Release (DR3) of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, a spectroscopic survey characterizing satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. The SAGA Survey DR3 includes 378 satellites identified across 101 MW-mass systems in the distance range 25-40.75 Mpc, and an accompanying redshift catalog of background galaxies (including about 46,000 taken by SAGA) in the SAGA footprint of 84.7 sq. deg. The number of confirmed satellites per system ranges from zero to 13, in the stellar mass range 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses. Based on a detailed completeness model, this sample accounts for 94% of the true satellite population down to a stellar mass of 10^7.5 solar masses. We find that the mass of the most massive satellite in SAGA systems is the strongest predictor of satellite abundance; one-third of the SAGA systems contain LMC-mass satellites, and they tend to have more satellites than the MW. The SAGA satellite radial distribution is less concentrated than the MW, and the SAGA quenched fraction below 10^8.5 solar masses is lower than the MW, but in both cases, the MW is within 1 sigma of SAGA system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellites do not exhibit a clear corotating signal as has been suggested in the MW/M31 satellite systems. Although the MW differs in many respects from the typical SAGA system, these differences can be reconciled if the MW is an older, slightly less massive host with a recently accreted LMC/SMC system.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. IV. The Star Formation Properties of 101 Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the star-forming properties of 378 satellite galaxies around 101 Milky Way analogs in the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey, focusing on the environmental processes that suppress or quench star formation. In the SAGA stellar mass range of 10^6 to 10^10 solar masses, we present quenched fractions, star-forming rates, gas-phase metallicities, and gas content. The fraction of SAGA satellites that are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass and shows significant system-to-system scatter. SAGA satellite quenched fractions are highest in the central 100 kpc of their hosts and decline out to the virial radius. Splitting by specific star formation rate (sSFR), the least star-forming satellite quartile follows the radial trend of the quenched population. The median sSFR of star-forming satellites increases with decreasing stellar mass and is roughly constant with projected radius. Star-forming SAGA satellites are consistent with the star formation rate-stellar mass relationship determined in the Local Volume, while the median gas-phase metallicity is higher and median HI gas mass is lower at all stellar masses. We investigate the dependence of the satellite quenched fraction on host properties. Quenched fractions are higher in systems with higher host halo mass, but this trend is only seen in the inner 100 kpc; systems with a massive neighbor within 2.5 Mpc show higher quenched fractions at all radii. Our results suggest that lower mass satellites and satellites inside 100 kpc are more efficiently quenched in a Milky Way-like environment, with these processes acting sufficiently slowly to preserve a population of star-forming satellites at all stellar masses and projected radii.</description>

      <title>The SAGA Survey. V. Modeling Satellite Systems around Milky Way-mass Galaxies with Updated UniverseMachine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environment plays a critical role in shaping the assembly of low-mass galaxies. Here, we use the UniverseMachine (UM) galaxy-halo connection framework and the Data Release 3 of the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey to place dwarf galaxy star formation and quenching into a cosmological context. UM is a data-driven forward model that flexibly parameterizes galaxy star formation rates (SFR) using only halo mass and assembly history. We add a new quenching model to UM, tailored for galaxies with stellar masses $\lesssim 10^9$ solar masses, and constrain the model down to a stellar mass $\gtrsim 10^7$ solar masses using new SAGA observations of 101 satellite systems around Milky Way (MW)-mass hosts and a sample of isolated field galaxies in a similar mass range from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The new best-fit model, 'UM-SAGA,' reproduces the satellite stellar mass functions, average SFRs, and quenched fractions in SAGA satellites while keeping isolated dwarfs mostly star forming. The enhanced quenching in satellites relative to isolated field galaxies leads the model to maximally rely on halo assembly to explain the observed environmental quenching. Extrapolating the model down to a stellar mass $\sim 10^{6.5}$ solar masses yields a quenched fraction of $\gtrsim$ 30% for isolated field galaxies and $\gtrsim$ 80% for satellites of MW-mass hosts at this stellar mass. This specific prediction can soon be tested by spectroscopic surveys to reveal the relative importance of internal feedback, cessation of mass and gas accretion, satellite-specific gas processes, and reionization for the evolution of faint low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>The extent and power of "maintainance mode" feedback in MaNGA AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ionised gas kinematics of 293 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) hosts as compared to that of 485 control galaxies from the MaNGA-SDSS survey using measurements of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007\AA emission-line profiles, presenting flux, velocity and W$_{80}$ maps. In 45% of the AGN, a broad component was needed to fit the line profiles wings within the inner few kpc, that we have identified with an outflow. But in most AGN, the profiles are broader than that of their controls over a much more extended region, identified as the "kinematically disturbed regions" (KDRs). We find a positive correlation between the mean $\langle$W$_{80}\rangle$ and L[OIII], supporting that the KDR is due to heating and turbulence of the ISM by outflows and radiation from the AGN. The extent R$_{KDR}$ reaches up to 24kpc, with a mean ratio to that of the ENLR of 57%. We estimate ionised gas mass flow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm out}$) and kinetic powers ($\dot{E}_{\rm out}$) both from the AGN broad components and from the W$_{80}$ values, that can be obtained for the whole AGN sample. We find values for $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$ and $\dot{E}_{\rm out}$ that correlate with the AGN luminosity $L_{bol}$, populating the low luminosity end of these known correlations. The mean coupling efficiency between $\dot{E}_{\rm out}$ and AGN luminosity is $\approx$ 0.02% from the W$_{80}$ values and lower from the broad component. But the large extent of the KDR shows that even low-luminosity AGN can impact the host galaxy along several kpc in a "maintenance mode" feedback.</description>

      <title>The CO-to-H$_2$ Conversion Factor in the Barred Spiral Galaxy M83</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$) in the nearby barred spiral galaxy M83. We present new HI observations from the JVLA and single-dish GBT in the disk of the galaxy, and combine them with maps of CO(1-0) integrated intensity and dust surface density from the literature. $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ and the gas-to-dust ratio ($\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$) are simultaneously derived in annuli of 2 kpc width from R = 1-7 kpc. We find that $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ and $\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$ both increase radially, by a factor of $\sim$ 2-3 from the center to the outskirts of the disk. The luminosity-weighted averages over the disk are $\alpha_{\rm{CO}} = 3.14$ (2.06, 4.96) M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$[K$\cdot$ km s$^{-1}$]$^{-1}$ and $\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$ = 137 (111, 182) at the 68% (1$\sigma$) confidence level. These are consistent with the $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ and $\delta_{\rm{GDR}}$ values measured in the Milky Way. In addition to possible variations of $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ due to the radial metallicity gradient, we test the possibility of variations in $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$ due to changes in the underlying cloud populations, as a function of galactic radius. Using a truncated power-law molecular cloud CO luminosity function and an empirical power-law relation for cloud-mass and luminosity, we show that the changes in the underlying cloud population may account for a factor of $\sim 1.5-2.0$ radial change in $\alpha_{\rm{CO}}$.</description>

      <title>SMARTY: The mileS Moderate resolution neAr-infRared sTellar librarY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the observed galaxies cannot be resolved into individual stars and are studied through their integrated spectrum using simple stellar populations (SSPs) models, with stellar libraries being a key ingredient in building them. Spectroscopic observations are increasingly being directed towards the near-infrared (NIR), where much is yet to be explored. SSPs in the NIR are still limited, and there are inconsistencies between different sets of models. One of the ways to minimize this problem is to have reliable NIR stellar libraries. The main goal of this work is to present SMARTY (mileS Moderate resolution neAr-infRared sTellar librarY) a ~0.9-2.4$\mu$m stellar spectral library composed of 31 stars observed with the Gemini Near-IR Spectrograph (GNIRS) at the 8.1m Gemini North telescope and make it available to the community. The stars were chosen from the SMARTY library, for which the atmospheric parameters are reliable (and well tested), to populate different regions of the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. Furthermore, five of these stars have NIR spectra available that we use to assess the quality of SMARTY. The remaining 26 stars are presented for the first time in the NIR. We compared the observed SMARTY spectra with synthetic and interpolated spectra, finding a mean difference of ~20% in the equivalent widths and ~1% in the overall continuum shape in both sets of comparisons. We computed the spectrophotometric broadband magnitudes and colours and compared them with the 2MASS ones, resulting in mean differences up to 0.07 and 0.10mag in magnitudes and colours, respectively. In general, a small difference was noted between the SMARTY spectra corrected using the continuum from the interpolated and the theoretical stars.</description>

      <title>When are galactic winds molecular?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular phase of supernova-driven outflows originates from the cold, molecular gas in the disc of a star-forming galaxy, and may carry a substantial fraction of the wind mass flux in some galaxies, but it remains poorly understood. Observations of this phase come mostly from very nearby galaxies due its low surface brightness and covering fraction, and simulations often lack the spatial resolution necessary to resolve it. Here we analytically estimate the survivability of this phase in order to understand under what conditions an galactic wind can contain a significant molecular phase. We show that the molecular content of outflows is primarily determined by two dimensionless numbers: a generalised Eddington ratio describing the strength of the outflow and an ionisation parameter-like quantity describing the strength of the radiation field per baryon. We apply this model to a sample of galaxies and show that, while any molecules entrained in the winds of normal star-forming galaxies should be destroyed close to the galactic disc, the outflows of strong starburst should become increasingly dominated by molecules.</description>

      <title>A Blueprint for the Milky Way's Stellar Populations. V. 3D Local Dust Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a grid of empirically calibrated synthetic spectra developed in our previous study, we construct an all-sky 3D extinction map from the large collection of low-resolution XP spectra in Gaia DR3. Along each line of sight, with an area ranging from $0.2$ to $13.4$ deg$^2$, we determine both the reddening and metallicity of main-sequence stars and model the foreground extinction up to approximately $3$ kpc from the Sun. Furthermore, we explore variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio in our parameter search and identify its mean systematic change across diverse cloud environments in both hemispheres. In regions outside the densest parts of the clouds, our reddening estimates are validated through comparisons with previous reddening maps. However, a notable discrepancy arises in comparison to other independent work based on XP spectra, which can be attributed to systematic offsets in their metallicity estimates. On the other hand, our metallicity scale exhibits reasonable agreement with the high-resolution spectroscopic abundance scale. We also assess the accuracy of the XP spectra by applying our calibrated models, and we confirm an increasing trend of flux overestimation at shorter wavelengths below $400$ nm.</description>

      <title>VLBI with SKA: Possible Arrays and Astrometric Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is stepping into the era of microarcsecond ($\mu$as) astronomy, and pushing astronomy, especially astrometry, to new heights. VLBI with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), SKA-VLBI, will increase current sensitivity by an order of magnitude, and reach astrometric precision routinely below 10 $\mu$as, even challenging 1 $\mu$as. This advancement allows precise parallax and proper motion measurements of various celestial objects. Such improvements can be used to study objects (including isolated objects, and binary or multiple systems) in different stellar stages (such as star formation, main-sequence stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, pulsars, black holes, white dwarfs, etc.), unveil the structure and evolution of complex systems (such as the Milky Way), benchmark the international celestial reference frame, and reveal cosmic expansion. Furthermore, the theory of general relativity can also be tested with SKA-VLBI using precise measurements of light deflection under the gravitational fields of different solar system objects and the perihelion precession of solar system objects.</description>

      <title>Isochrone Fitting of Galactic Globular Clusters -- VI. High-latitude Clusters NGC5024 (M53), NGC5053, NGC5272 (M3), NGC5466, and NGC7099 (M30)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fit various colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the high-latitude Galactic globular clusters NGC\,5024 (M53), NGC\,5053, NGC\,5272 (M3), NGC\,5466, and NGC\,7099 (M30) by isochrones from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database and Bag of Stellar Tracks and Isochrones for $\alpha$-enrichment [$\alpha$/Fe]$=+0.4$. For the CMDs, we use data sets from {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, {\it Gaia}, and other sources utilizing, at least, 25 photometric filters for each cluster. We obtain the following characteristics with their statistic uncertainties for NGC\,5024, NGC\,5053, NGC\,5272, NGC\,5466, and NGC\,7099, respectively: metallicities [Fe/H]$=-1.93\pm0.02$, $-2.08\pm0.03$, $-1.60\pm0.02$, $-1.95\pm0.02$, and $-2.07\pm0.04$ dex with their systematic uncertainty 0.1 dex; ages $13.00\pm0.11$, $12.70\pm0.11$, $11.63\pm0.07$, $12.15\pm0.11$, and $12.80\pm0.17$ Gyr with their systematic uncertainty 0.8 Gyr; distances (systematic uncertainty added) $18.22\pm0.06\pm0.60$, $16.99\pm0.06\pm0.56$, $10.08\pm0.04\pm0.33$, $15.59\pm0.03\pm0.51$, and $8.29\pm0.03\pm0.27$ kpc; reddenings $E(B-V)=0.023\pm0.004$, $0.017\pm0.004$, $0.023\pm0.004$, $0.023\pm0.003$, and $0.045\pm0.002$ mag with their systematic uncertainty 0.01 mag; extinctions $A_\mathrm{V}=0.08\pm0.01$, $0.06\pm0.01$, $0.08\pm0.01$, $0.08\pm0.01$, and $0.16\pm0.01$ mag with their systematic uncertainty 0.03 mag, which suggest the total Galactic extinction $A_\mathrm{V}=0.08$ across the whole Galactic dust to extragalactic objects at the North Galactic pole. The horizontal branch morphology difference of these clusters is explained by their different metallicity, age, mass-loss efficiency, and loss of low-mass members in the evolution of the core-collapse cluster NGC\,7099 and loose clusters NGC\,5053 and NGC\,5466.</description>

      <title>Uncovering an Excess of X-ray Point Sources in the Halos of Virgo Late-type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for extraplanar X-ray point sources around 19 late-type, highly inclined disk galaxies residing in the Virgo cluster, based on archival Chandra observations reaching a source detection sensitivity of $L\rm(0.5- 8~keV)\sim10^{38}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$. Based on the cumulative source surface density distribution as a function of projected vertical distance from the disk mid-plane, we identify a statistically significant ($\sim3.3\sigma$) excess of $\sim20$ X-ray sources within a projected vertical off-disk distance of $0.92'-2.5'$ ($\sim4.4-12\ \mathrm{kpc}$), the presence of which cannot be explained by the bulk stellar content of the individual galaxies, nor by the cosmic X-ray background. On the other hand, there is no significant evidence for an excess of extraplanar X-ray sources in a comparison sample of field late-type edge-on galaxies, for which Chandra observations reaching a similar source detection sensitivity are available. We discuss possible origins for the observed excess, which include low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with globular clusters, supernova-kicked LMXBs, high-mass X-ray binaries born in recent star formation induced by ram pressure stripping of the disk gas, as well as a class of intra-cluster X-ray sources previously identified around early-type member galaxies of Virgo. We find that none of these X-ray populations can naturally dominate the observed extraplanar excess, although supernova-kicked LMXBs and the effect of ram pressure are most likely relevant</description>

      <title>Leading Axion-Photon Sensitivity with NuSTAR Observations of M82 and M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the most sensitive search to-date for the existence of ultralight axions using data from the NuSTAR telescope. We search for stellar axion production in the M82 starburst galaxy and the M87 central galaxy of the Virgo cluster and then the subsequent conversion into hard X-rays in the surrounding magnetic fields. We sum over the full stellar populations in these galaxies when computing the axion luminosity, and we account for the conversion of axions to photons by using magnetic field profiles in simulated IllustrisTNG analogue galaxies. We show that analyzing NuSTAR data towards these targets between roughly 30 to 70 keV shows no evidence for axions and leads to robust constraints on the axion-photon coupling at the level of $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}| \lesssim 6.4 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV at 95% confidence.</description>

      <title>Impact of main-sequence mass loss on the appearance, structure and evolution of Wolf-Rayet stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar winds are one of the most important drivers of massive star evolution and a vital source of chemical, mechanical, and radiative feedback. Despite its significance, mass loss remains a major uncertainty in stellar evolution models. Particularly the interdependencies of different approaches with subsequent evolutionary stages and predicted observable phenomena are far from being systematically understood. In this study, we examine the impact of main sequence mass loss on the structure of massive stars throughout their evolution. A particular focus is placed on the consequences for entering the Wolf-Rayet (WR) regime and the subsequent evolution. Using the Geneva stellar evolution code, we compute grids of single, non-rotating stellar models at solar and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) metallicity of initial masses between 20 and 120 solar masses, with two representative prescriptions for high and low main sequence mass loss. We obtain detailed numerical predictions regarding the structure and evolution of massive stars, and infer the role of main sequence mass loss by comparison of the mass-loss rate prescriptions. We present implications for the overall evolutionary trajectory, including the evolution of WR stars, as well as the effect on stellar yields and stellar populations. Mass loss during the main sequence plays an important role due to its ability to affect the sequence and duration of all subsequent phases. We identify several distinct evolutionary paths for massive stars which are significantly influenced by the chosen main sequence mass-loss description. We also discuss the impact of uncertainties other than mass loss on the evolution, in particular those relating to convection. We further demonstrate that not just the total mass loss, but the specific mass-loss history throughout a star's life is a crucial determinant of many aspects, such as the resulting stellar yields.</description>

      <title>Formation of low mass protostars and their circumstellar disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The birth process of circumstellar disks remains poorly constrained due to observational and numerical challenges. Recent numerical works have shown that the small-scale physics, often wrapped into a sub-grid model, play a crucial role in disk formation and evolution. This calls for a combined approach in which both the protostar and circumstellar disk are studied in concert. We aim to elucidate the small scale physics and constrain sub-grid parameters commonly chosen in the literature by resolving the star-disk interaction. We carry out a set of very high resolution 3D radiative-hydrodynamics simulations that self-consistently describe the collapse of a turbulent dense molecular cloud core to stellar densities. We study the birth of the protostar, the circumstellar disk, and its early evolution (&lt; 6 yr after protostellar formation). Following the second gravitational collapse, the nascent protostar quickly reaches breakup velocity and sheds its surface material, thus forming a hot ($\sim 10^{3}$ K), dense, and highly flared circumstellar disk. The protostar is embedded within the disk, such that material can flow without crossing any shock fronts. The circumstellar disk mass quickly exceeds that of the protostar, and its kinematics are dominated by self-gravity. Accretion onto the disk is highly anisotropic, and accretion onto the protostar mainly occurs through material that slides on the disk surface. The polar mass flux is negligible in comparison. The radiative behavior also displays a strong anisotropy, as the polar accretion shock is shown to be supercritical whereas its equatorial counterpart is subcritical. We also find a remarkable convergence of our results with respect to initial conditions. These results reveal the structure and kinematics in the smallest spatial scales relevant to protostellar and circumstellar disk evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the massless particles orbiting a spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole with a radius equal to the photon sphere and a circular geodesic. Asymptotic observers record the orbital period of the null circular geodesic as the lowest among all possible paths around the compact object. We proceed with the analytical study of massless particle motion to demonstrate the instability of an orbit with null circularity. Furthermore, our results apply to any asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quantum study of the CH$_3^+$ photodissociation in full dimension Neural Networks potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CH$_3^+$, a cornerstone intermediate in interstellar chemistry, has recently been detected for the first time by the James Webb Space Telescope. The photodissociation of this ion is studied here. Accurate explicitly correlated multi-reference configuration interaction {\it ab initio} calculations are done, and full dimensional potential energy surfaces are developed for the three lower electronic states, with a fundamental invariant neural network method. The photodissociation cross section is calculated using a full dimensional quantum wave packet method, in heliocentric Radau coordinates. The wave packet is represented in angular and radial grids allowing to reduce the number of points physically accessible, requiring to push up the spurious states appearing when evaluating the angular kinetic terms, through a projection technique. The photodissociation spectra, when employed in astrochemical models to simulate the conditions of the Orion Bar, results in a lesser destruction of CH$_3^+$ compared to that obtained when utilizing the recommended values in the kinetic database for astrochemistry (KIDA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a novel method to compute the components of dynamo tensors from direct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Our method relies upon an extension and generalisation of the standard H\"ogbom CLEAN algorithm widely used in radio astronomy to systematically remove the impact of the strongest beams onto the corresponding image. This generalisation, called the Iterative Removal of Sources (IROS) method, has been adopted here to model the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) in terms of the mean magnetic fields and currents. Analogous to the CLEAN algorithm, IROS treats the time series of the mean magnetic field and current as beams that convolve with the dynamo coefficients which are treated as (clean) images to produce the EMF time series (the dirty image). We apply this method to MHD simulations of galactic dynamos, to which we have previously employed other methods of computing dynamo coefficients such as the test-field method, the regression method, as well as local and non-local versions of the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. We show that our new method reliably recovers the dynamo coefficients from the MHD simulations. It also allows priors on the dynamo coefficients to be incorporated easily during the inversion, unlike in earlier methods. Moreover, using synthetic data, we demonstrate that it may serve as a viable post-processing tool in determining the dynamo coefficients, even when the power of additive noise to the EMF is twice as much the actual EMF.</description>

      <title>A JWST investigation into the bar fraction at redshifts 1 &lt; z &lt; 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of a stellar bar in a disc galaxy indicates that the galaxy hosts in its main part a dynamically settled disc and that bar-driven processes are taking place in shaping its evolution. Studying the cosmic evolution of the bar fraction in disc galaxies is therefore essential to understand galaxy evolution in general. Previous studies have found, using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), that the bar fraction significantly declines from the local Universe to redshifts near one. Using the first four pointings from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) and the initial public observations for the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research (PRIMER), we extend the studies of the bar fraction in disc galaxies to redshifts $1 \leq z \leq 3$, i.e., for the first time beyond redshift two. We only use galaxies that are also present in the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) on the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) and Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) HST observations. An optimised sample of 368 close-to-face-on galaxies is visually classified to find the fraction of bars in disc galaxies in two redshift bins: $1 \leq z \leq 2$ and $2 &lt; z \leq 3$. The bar fraction decreases from $\approx 17.8^{+ 5.1}_{- 4.8}$ per cent to $\approx 13.8^{+ 6.5}_{- 5.8}$ per cent (from the lower to the higher redshift bin), but is about twice the bar fraction found using bluer HST filters. Our results show that bar-driven evolution might commence at early cosmic times and that dynamically settled discs are already present at a lookback time of $\sim 11$ Gyrs.</description>

      <title>MaNGA DynPop -- V. The dark-matter fraction versus stellar velocity dispersion relation and stellar initial mass function variations in galaxies: dynamical models and full spectrum fitting of integral-field spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Using the final MaNGA sample of 10K galaxies, we investigate the dark matter fraction $f_{\rm DM}$ within one half-light radius $R_{\rm e}$ for about 6K galaxies with good kinematics spanning a wide range of morphologies and stellar velocity dispersion. We employ two techniques to estimate $f_{\rm DM}$: (i) Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM), which performs dark matter decomposition based on stellar kinematics and (ii) comparing the total dynamical mass-to-light ratios $(M/L)_{\rm JAM}$ and $(M_{\ast}/L)_{\rm SPS}$ from Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS). We find that both methods consistently show a significant trend of increasing $f_{\rm DM}$ with decreasing $\sigma_{\rm e}$ and low $f_{\rm DM}$ at larger $\sigma_{\rm e}$. For 235 early-type galaxies with the best models, we explore the variation of stellar initial mass function (IMF) by comparing the stellar mass-to-light ratios from JAM and SPS. We confirm that the stellar mass excess factor $\alpha_{\rm IMF}$ increases with $\sigma_{\rm e}$, consistent with previous studies that reported a transition from Chabrier-like to Salpeter IMF among galaxies. We show that the $\alpha_{\rm IMF}$ trend cannot be driven by $M_{\ast}/L$ or IMF gradients as it persists when allowing for radial gradients in our model. We find no evidence for the total $M/L$ increasing toward the centre. We detect weak positive correlations between $\alpha_{\rm IMF}$ and age, but no correlations with metallicity. We stack galaxy spectra according to their $\alpha_{\rm IMF}$ to search for differences in IMF-sensitive spectral features (e.g. the $\rm Na_{\rm I}$ doublet). We only find marginal evidence for such differences, which casts doubt on the validity of one or both methods to measure the IMF.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: Unveiling the Role of Strong Ha-emitters during the Epoch of Reionization with JWST</title>

Abstract: By using the ultra-deep \textit{JWST}/MIRI image at 5.6 $\mu m$ in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, we constrain the role of strong H$\alpha$-emitters (HAEs) during Cosmic Reionization at $z\simeq7-8$. Our sample of HAEs is comprised of young ($&lt;35\;\rm Myr$) galaxies, except for one single galaxy ($\approx 300\;\rm Myr$), with low stellar masses ($\lesssim 10^{9}\;\rm M_{\odot}$). These HAEs show a wide range of UV-$\beta$ slopes, with a median value of $\beta = -2.15\pm0.21$ which broadly correlates with stellar mass. We estimate the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{ion,0}$) of these sources (assuming $f_{esc,LyC} = 0\%$), which yields a median value $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion,0}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.50^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$. We show that $\xi_{ion,0}$ positively correlates with EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Instead $\xi_{ion,0}$ weakly anti-correlates with stellar mass and $\beta$. Based on the $\beta$ values, we predict $f_{esc, LyC}=4\%^{+3}_{-2}$, which results in $\rm log_{10}(\xi_{ion}/(Hz\;erg^{-1})) = 25.55^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$. Considering this and related findings from the literature, we find a mild evolution of $\xi_{ion}$with redshift. Additionally, our results suggest that these HAEs require only modest escape fractions ($f_{esc, rel}$) of 6$-$15\% to reionize their surrounding intergalactic medium. By only considering the contribution of these HAEs, we estimated their total ionizing emissivity ($\dot{N}_{ion}$) as $\dot{N}_{ion} = 10^{50.53 \pm 0.45}; \text{s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-3}$. When comparing their $\dot{N}_{ion}$ with "non-H$\alpha$ emitter" galaxies across the same redshift range, we find that that strong, young, and low-mass emitters may have played an important role during Cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of a Substantial Discrepancy between Radio and UV--IR Measures of the Star Formation Rate Density at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the initial sample of redshifts for 3,839 galaxies in the MeerKAT DEEP2 field -- the deepest $\sim$1.4\,GHz radio field yet observed. Using a spectrophotometric technique combining coarse optical spectra with broadband photometry, we obtain redshifts with $\sigma_z \leq 0.01(1+z)$. The resulting radio luminosity functions between $0.2&lt;z&lt;1.3$ from our sample of 3,839 individual galaxies are in remarkable agreement with those inferred from modeling radio source counts, confirming an excess in radio-based SFRD$(z$) measurements at late times compared to those from the UV--IR. Several sources of systematic error are discussed -- with most having the potential of exacerbating the discrepancy -- with the conclusion that significant work remains to have confidence in a full accounting of the star formation budget of the universe.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Imprints on DM Halos: the concentration-mass relation and its dependence on halo and galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The halo concentration-mass relation has ubiquitous use in modeling the matter field for cosmological and astrophysical analyses, and including the imprints from galaxy formation physics is tantamount to its robust usage. Many analyses, however, probe the matter around halos selected by a given halo/galaxy property -- rather than by halo mass -- and the imprints under each selection choice can be different. We employ the CAMELS simulation suite to quantify the astrophysics and cosmology dependence of the concentration-mass relation, $c_{\rm vir}-M_{\rm vir}$, when selected on five properties: (i) velocity dispersion, (ii) formation time, (iii) halo spin, (iv) stellar mass, and (v) gas mass. We construct simulation-informed nonlinear models for all properties as a function of halo mass, redshift, and six cosmological/astrophysical parameters, with a mass range $M_{\rm vir} \in [10^{11}, 10^{14.5}] M_\odot/h$. There are many mass-dependent imprints in all halo properties, with clear connections across different properties and non-linear couplings between the parameters. Finally, we extract the $c_{\rm vir}-M_{\rm vir}$ relation for subsamples of halos that have scattered above/below the mean property-$M_{\rm vir}$ relation for a chosen property. Selections on gas mass or stellar mass have a significant impact on the astrophysics/cosmology dependence of $c_{\rm vir}$, while those on any of the other three properties have a significant (mild) impact on the cosmology (astrophysics) dependence. We show that ignoring such selection effects can lead to errors of $\approx 25\%$ in baryon imprint modelling of $c_{\rm vir}$. Our nonlinear model for all properties is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Survival and Entrainment of Molecules and Dust in Galactic Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen excellent progress in modeling the entrainment of T $\sim$ $10^4$K atomic gas in galactic winds. However, the entrainment of cool, dusty T $\sim$ 10-100K molecular gas, which is also observed outflowing at high velocity, is much less understood. Such gas, which can be $10^5$ times denser than the hot wind, appears extremely difficult to entrain. We run 3D wind-tunnel simulations with photoionization self-shielding and evolve thermal dust sputtering and growth. Unlike almost all such simulations to date, we do not enforce any artificial temperature floor. We find efficient molecular gas formation and entrainment, as well as dust survival and growth through accretion. Key to this success is the formation of large amounts of 10^4K atomic gas via mixing, which acts as a protective "bubble wrap" and reduces the cloud overdensity to $\sim$ 100. This can be understood from the ratio of the mixing to cooling time. Before entrainment, when shear is large, t_mix/t_cool $\leq$ 1, and gas cannot cool below the "cooling bottleneck" at 5000K. Thus, the cloud survival criterion is identical to the well-studied purely atomic case. After entrainment, when shear falls, t_mix/t_cool &gt; 1, and the cloud becomes multi-phase, with comparable molecular and atomic masses. The broad temperature PDF, with abundant gas in the formally unstable 50 K &lt; T &lt; 5000 K range, agrees with previous ISM simulations with driven turbulence and radiative cooling. Our findings have implications for dusty molecular gas in stellar and AGN outflows, cluster filaments, "jellyfish" galaxies and AGB winds.</description>

      <title>Bidimensional Exploration of the warm-Temperature Ionised gaS (BETIS) I. Showcase sample and first results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Bidimensional Exploration of the warm-Temperature Ionised gaS (BETIS) project, designed for the spatial and spectral study of the diffuse ionised gas (DIG) in a selection of nearby spiral galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph. Our primary objective is to investigate the various ionisation mechanisms at play within the DIG. We analysed the distribution of high- and low-ionisation species in the optical spectra of the sample on a spatially resolved basis. We introduced a new methodology for spectroscopically defining the DIG, optimised for galaxies of different resolutions. We also examined the suitability of using Ha equivalent width (EWha) as a proxy for defining the DIG and its associated ionisation regime. The average radial distribution of the main line ratios are enhanced in the DIG. It follows similar trends between the DIG regime and the HII regions, as well as the Ha surface brightness, indicating a correlation between the ionisation of these species in both the DIG and the HII regions. The DIG loci in diagnostic diagrams are found within the line ratios that correspond to photoionisation due to the star formation. There is a noticeable offset correspondent to fast shocks. However, an individual diagnosis performed for each galaxy reveals that all the DIG in these galaxies can be attributed to photoionisation from star formation. The offset is primarily due to the contribution of Seyfert galaxies in our sample, which is closely aligned with models of ionisation from fast shocks and galactic outflows, thus mimicking the DIG emission. Our results indicate that galaxies exhibiting active galactic nucleus activity should be considered separately when conducting a general analysis of the DIG ionisation mechanisms, since this emission is indistinguishable from high-excitation DIG.</description>

      <title>JWST Reveals a Surprisingly High Fraction of Galaxies Being Spiral-like at $0.5\leq z\leq4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiral arms are one of the most important features used to classify the morphology of local galaxies. The cosmic epoch when spiral arms first appeared contains essential clues to the evolution of disk galaxies. In this letter, we used James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey to visually identify spiral galaxies with redshift $0.5\leq z\leq4$ and stellar mass $\geq10^{10}\; M_\odot$. Out of 873 galaxies, 216 were found to have a spiral structure. The spiral galaxies in our sample have higher star formation rates (SFRs) and larger sizes than non-spiral galaxies. We found the observed spiral fraction decreases from 48% at $z\sim0.75$ to 8% at $z\sim2.75$. These fractions are higher than the fractions observed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We even detect possible spiral-like features at redshifts $z&gt;3$. We artificially redshifted low redshift galaxies to high redshifts and re-inspected them to evaluate observational effects. By varying the input spiral fraction of the redshifted sample, we found that the input fraction of $\sim35$% matches the observed fraction at $z=2-3$ the best. We are able to rule out spiral fractions being $&lt;20$% (2$\sigma$) and $&lt;10$% (3$\sigma$) for real galaxies at $z\sim3$. This fraction is surprisingly high and implies that the formation of spiral arms, as well as disks, was earlier in the universe.</description>

      <title>The Impact of an AGN on PAH Emission in Galaxies: the Case of Ring Galaxy NGC 4138</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a focused study of radially-resolved varying PAH emission in the low-luminosity AGN-host NGC 4138 using deep Spitzer/IRS spectral maps. Using new model PAH spectra, we investigate whether these variations could be associated with changes to the PAH grain size distribution due to photodestruction by the AGN. Separately, we model the effects of the varying radiation field within NGC 4138, and we use this model to predict the corresponding changes in the PAH emission spectrum. We find that PAH band ratios are strongly variable with radius in this galaxy with short-to-long wavelength band ratios peaking in the starburst ring. The changing mix of starlight appears to have a considerable effect on the trends in these band ratios, and our radiation model predicts the shapes of these trends. However, the amplitude of observed variation is ~2.5 times larger than predicted for some ratios. A cutoff of small grains in the PAH size distribution, as has been suggested for AGN, together with changes in PAH ionization fraction could explain the behavior of the shorter bands, but this model fails to reproduce longer band behaviors. Additionally, we find that short-to-long wavelength PAH band ratios increase slightly within ~270pc of the center, suggesting that the AGN may directly influence PAH emission there.</description>

      <title>A perspective on the Milky Way Bulge-Bar as seen from the neutron-capture elements Cerium and Neodymium with APOGEE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study probes the chemical abundances of the neutron-capture elements cerium and neodymium in the inner Milky Way from an analysis of a sample of $\sim$2000 stars in the Galactic Bulge/bar spatially contained within $|X_{Gal}|&lt;$5 kpc, $|Y_{Gal}|&lt;$3.5 kpc, and $|Z_{Gal}|&lt;$1 kpc, and spanning metallicities between $-$2.0$\lesssim$[Fe/H]$\lesssim$+0.5. We classify the sample stars into low- or high-[Mg/Fe] populations and find that, in general, values of [Ce/Fe] and [Nd/Fe] increase as the metallicity decreases for the low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations. Ce abundances show a more complex variation across the metallicity range of our Bulge-bar sample when compared to Nd, with the r-process dominating the production of neutron-capture elements in the high-[Mg/Fe] population ([Ce/Nd]$&lt;$0.0). We find a spatial chemical dependence of Ce and Nd abundances for our sample of Bulge-bar stars, with low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations displaying a distinct abundance distribution. In the region close to the center of the MW, the low-[Mg/Fe] population is dominated by stars with low [Ce/Fe], [Ce/Mg], [Nd/Mg], [Nd/Fe], and [Ce/Nd] ratios. The low [Ce/Nd] ratio indicates a significant contribution in this central region from r-process yields for the low-[Mg/Fe] population. The chemical pattern of the most metal-poor stars in our sample suggests an early chemical enrichment of the Bulge dominated by yields from core-collapse supernovae and r-process astrophysical sites, such as magneto-rotational supernovae.</description>

      <title>Simulations of galaxies in an expanding Universe with modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and with modified gravitational attractions (MOGA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of galaxies is either explained by the existence of dark matter or caused by a modification of Newtonian acceleration (MOND). Here we show that the modification of the Newtonian dynamics can equally well be obtained by a modification of Newton's law of universal gravitational attraction (MOGA), by which an inverse square attraction from a distant object is replaced with an inverse attraction. This modification is often proposed in the standard model, and with the modification of the attraction caused by dark matter. The recently derived algorithm, Eur. Phys. J. Plus 137, 99 (2022); Class. Quantum Grav. 39, 225006 (2022), for classical celestial dynamics is used to simulate models of the Milky Way in an expanding universe and with either MOND or MOGA. The simulations show that the galaxies with MOND dynamics are unstable whereas MOGA stabilizes the galaxies. The rotation velocities for objects in galaxies with classical Newtonian dynamics decline inversely proportional to the square root of the distance $r$ to the galaxy's center. However, the rotation velocities are relatively independent of $r$ for MOGA and qualitatively in agreement with experimentally determined rotation curves for galaxies in the Universe. The modification of the attractions may be caused by the masses of the objects in the central part of the galaxy by the lensing of gravitational waves from far-away objects in the galaxy.</description>

      <title>The relation between the cool-core radius and the host galaxy clusters: thermodynamic properties and cluster mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of cool-core systems in a sample of four galaxy clusters (RXCJ1504.1-0248, A3112, A4059, and A478) using archival X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Cool cores are frequently observed at the centers of galaxy clusters and are considered to be formed by radiative cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM). Cool cores are characterized by a significant drop in the ICM temperature toward the cluster center. We extract and analyze X-ray spectra of the ICM to measure the radial profiles of the ICM thermodynamic properties including temperature, density, pressure, entropy, and radiative cooling time. We define the cool-core radius as the turnover radius in the ICM temperature profile and investigate the relation between the cool-core radius and the properties of the host galaxy clusters. In our sample, we observe that the radiative cooling time of the ICM at the cool-core radius exceeds 10 Gyr, with RXCJ1504.1-0248 exhibiting a radiative cooling time of $32^{+5}_{-11}$ Gyr at its cool-core radius. These results indicate that not only radiative cooling but also additional mechanisms such as gas sloshing may play an important role in determining the size of cool cores. Additionally, we find that the best-fit relation between the cool-core radius and the cluster mass ($M_{500}$) is consistent with a linear relation. Our findings suggest that cool cores are linked to the evolution of their host galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical binary black hole mergers in globular clusters: mass function and evolution with redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers are one of the most straightforward mechanisms to produce BHs inside and above the pair-instability mass gap. Here, we investigate the impact of globular cluster (GC) evolution on hierarchical mergers, and we account for the uncertainties related to BH mass pairing functions on the predicted primary BH mass, mass ratio and spin distribution. We find that the evolution of the host GC quenches the hierarchical BH assembly already at the third generation, mainly due to cluster expansion powered by a central BH sub-system. Hierarchical mergers match the primary BH mass distribution from GW events for $m_1 &gt; 50 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, regardless of the assumed BH pairing function. At lower masses, however, different pairing functions lead to dramatically different predictions on the primary BH mass merger rate density. We find that the primary BH mass distribution evolves with redshift, with a larger contribution from mergers with $m_1 \geq 30 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ for $z\geq{}2$. Finally, we calculate the mixing fraction of BBHs from GCs and isolated binary systems. Our predictions are very sensitive to the spins, which favor a large fraction ($&gt;0.6$) of BBHs born in GCs, in order to reproduce misaligned spin observations.</description>

      <title>Using Rest-Frame Optical and NIR Data from the RAISIN Survey to Explore the Redshift Evolution of Dust Laws in SN Ia Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use rest-frame optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of 42 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Carnegie Supernova Project at low-$z$ and 37 from the RAISIN Survey at high-$z$ to investigate correlations between SN Ia host galaxy dust, host mass, and redshift. This is the first time the SN Ia host galaxy dust extinction law at high-$z$ has been estimated using combined optical and rest-frame NIR data ($YJ$-band). We use the BayeSN hierarchical model to leverage the data's wide rest-frame wavelength range (extending to $\sim$1.0-1.2 microns for the RAISIN sample at $0.2\lesssim z\lesssim0.6$). By contrasting the RAISIN and CSP data, we constrain the population distributions of the host dust $R_V$ parameter for both redshift ranges. We place a limit on the difference in population mean $R_V$ between RAISIN and CSP of $-1.16&lt;\Delta\mu(R_V)&lt;1.38$ with 95% posterior probability. For RAISIN we estimate $\mu(R_V)=2.58\pm0.57$, and constrain the population standard deviation to $\sigma(R_V)&lt;0.90~[2.42]$ at the 68 [95]% level. Given that we are only able to constrain the size of the low- to high-$z$ shift in $\mu(R_V)$ to $\lesssim1.4$ - which could still propagate to a substantial bias in the equation of state parameter $w$ - these and other recent results motivate continued effort to obtain rest-frame NIR data at low and high redshifts (e.g. using the Roman Space Telescope).</description>
