      <title>Multilingual Prompts in LLM-Based Recommenders: Performance Across Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in natural language processing tasks. Recommender systems traditionally use methods such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, as well as advanced techniques like deep learning and reinforcement learning. Although language models have been applied in recommendation, the recent trend have focused on leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs for more personalized suggestions. While current research focuses on English due to its resource richness, this work explores the impact of non-English prompts on recommendation performance. Using OpenP5, a platform for developing and evaluating LLM-based recommendations, we expanded its English prompt templates to include Spanish and Turkish. Evaluation on three real-world datasets, namely ML1M, LastFM, and Amazon-Beauty, showed that usage of non-English prompts generally reduce performance, especially in less-resourced languages like Turkish. We also retrained an LLM-based recommender model with multilingual prompts to analyze performance variations. Retraining with multilingual prompts resulted in more balanced performance across languages, but slightly reduced English performance. This work highlights the need for diverse language support in LLM-based recommenders and suggests future research on creating evaluation datasets, using newer models and additional languages.</description>

      <title>Leveraging User-Generated Reviews for Recommender Systems with Dynamic Headers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms have a vast catalog of items to cater to their customers' shopping interests. Most of these platforms assist their customers in the shopping process by offering optimized recommendation carousels, designed to help customers quickly locate their desired items. Many models have been proposed in academic literature to generate and enhance the ranking and recall set of items in these carousels. Conventionally, the accompanying carousel title text (header) of these carousels remains static. In most instances, a generic text such as "Items similar to your current viewing" is utilized. Fixed variations such as the inclusion of specific attributes "Other items from a similar seller" or "Items from a similar brand" in addition to "frequently bought together" or "considered together" are observed as well. This work proposes a novel approach to customize the header generation process of these carousels. Our work leverages user-generated reviews that lay focus on specific attributes (aspects) of an item that were favorably perceived by users during their interaction with the given item. We extract these aspects from reviews and train a graph neural network-based model under the framework of a conditional ranking task. We refer to our innovative methodology as Dynamic Text Snippets (DTS) which generates multiple header texts for an anchor item and its recall set. Our approach demonstrates the potential of utilizing user-generated reviews and presents a unique paradigm for exploring increasingly context-aware recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Q&amp;A Text Retrieval with Ranking Models: Benchmarking, fine-tuning and deploying Rerankers for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking models play a crucial role in enhancing overall accuracy of text retrieval systems. These multi-stage systems typically utilize either dense embedding models or sparse lexical indices to retrieve relevant passages based on a given query, followed by ranking models that refine the ordering of the candidate passages by its relevance to the query.
  This paper benchmarks various publicly available ranking models and examines their impact on ranking accuracy. We focus on text retrieval for question-answering tasks, a common use case for Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. Our evaluation benchmarks include models some of which are commercially viable for industrial applications.
  We introduce a state-of-the-art ranking model, NV-RerankQA-Mistral-4B-v3, which achieves a significant accuracy increase of ~14% compared to pipelines with other rerankers. We also provide an ablation study comparing the fine-tuning of ranking models with different sizes, losses and self-attention mechanisms.
  Finally, we discuss challenges of text retrieval pipelines with ranking models in real-world industry applications, in particular the trade-offs among model size, ranking accuracy and system requirements like indexing and serving latency / throughput.</description>

      <title>PDC-FRS: Privacy-preserving Data Contribution for Federated Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated recommender systems (FedRecs) have emerged as a popular research direction for protecting users' privacy in on-device recommendations. In FedRecs, users keep their data locally and only contribute their local collaborative information by uploading model parameters to a central server. While this rigid framework protects users' raw data during training, it severely compromises the recommendation model's performance due to the following reasons: (1) Due to the power law distribution nature of user behavior data, individual users have few data points to train a recommendation model, resulting in uploaded model updates that may be far from optimal; (2) As each user's uploaded parameters are learned from local data, which lacks global collaborative information, relying solely on parameter aggregation methods such as FedAvg to fuse global collaborative information may be suboptimal. To bridge this performance gap, we propose a novel federated recommendation framework, PDC-FRS. Specifically, we design a privacy-preserving data contribution mechanism that allows users to share their data with a differential privacy guarantee. Based on the shared but perturbed data, an auxiliary model is trained in parallel with the original federated recommendation process. This auxiliary model enhances FedRec by augmenting each user's local dataset and integrating global collaborative information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PDC-FRS, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used recommendation datasets. The empirical results showcase the superiority of PDC-FRS compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cross-Market Recommendation System with Graph Isomorphism Networks: A Novel Approach to Personalized User Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's world of globalized commerce, cross-market recommendation systems (CMRs) are crucial for providing personalized user experiences across diverse market segments. However, traditional recommendation algorithms have difficulties dealing with market specificity and data sparsity, especially in new or emerging markets. In this paper, we propose the CrossGR model, which utilizes Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs) to improve CMR systems. It outperforms existing benchmarks in NDCG@10 and HR@10 metrics, demonstrating its adaptability and accuracy in handling diverse market segments. The CrossGR model is adaptable and accurate, making it well-suited for handling the complexities of cross-market recommendation tasks. Its robustness is demonstrated by consistent performance across different evaluation timeframes, indicating its potential to cater to evolving market trends and user preferences. Our findings suggest that GINs represent a promising direction for CMRs, paving the way for more sophisticated, personalized, and context-aware recommendation systems in the dynamic landscape of global e-commerce.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Automatic Modulation Classification via Deep Edge Inference for Hierarchical Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hierarchical cognitive radio networks, edge or cloud servers utilize the data collected by edge devices for modulation classification, which, however, is faced with problems of the transmission overhead, data privacy, and computation load. In this article, an edge learning (EL) based framework jointly mobilizing the edge device and the edge server for intelligent co-inference is proposed to realize the collaborative automatic modulation classification (C-AMC) between them. A spectrum semantic compression neural network (SSCNet) with the lightweight structure is designed for the edge device to compress the collected raw data into a compact semantic message that is then sent to the edge server via the wireless channel. On the edge server side, a modulation classification neural network (MCNet) combining bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi?LSTM) and multi-head attention layers is elaborated to deter?mine the modulation type from the noisy semantic message. By leveraging the computation resources of both the edge device and the edge server, high transmission overhead and risks of data privacy leakage are avoided. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed C-AMC framework, significantly reducing the model size and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation Framework for Attributed Information Retrieval using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing success of Large Language models (LLMs) in information-seeking scenarios, search engines are now adopting generative approaches to provide answers along with in-line citations as attribution. While existing work focuses mainly on attributed question answering, in this paper, we target information-seeking scenarios which are often more challenging due to the open-ended nature of the queries and the size of the label space in terms of the diversity of candidate-attributed answers per query. We propose a reproducible framework to evaluate and benchmark attributed information seeking, using any backbone LLM, and different architectural designs: (1) Generate (2) Retrieve then Generate, and (3) Generate then Retrieve. Experiments using HAGRID, an attributed information-seeking dataset, show the impact of different scenarios on both the correctness and attributability of answers.</description>

      <title>On the challenges of studying bias in Recommender Systems: A UserKNN case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statements on the propagation of bias by recommender systems are often hard to verify or falsify. Research on bias tends to draw from a small pool of publicly available datasets and is therefore bound by their specific properties. Additionally, implementation choices are often not explicitly described or motivated in research, while they may have an effect on bias propagation. In this paper, we explore the challenges of measuring and reporting popularity bias. We showcase the impact of data properties and algorithm configurations on popularity bias by combining synthetic data with well known recommender systems frameworks that implement UserKNN. First, we identify data characteristics that might impact popularity bias, based on the functionality of UserKNN. Accordingly, we generate various datasets that combine these characteristics. Second, we locate UserKNN configurations that vary across implementations in literature. We evaluate popularity bias for five synthetic datasets and five UserKNN configurations, and offer insights on their joint effect. We find that, depending on the data characteristics, various UserKNN configurations can lead to different conclusions regarding the propagation of popularity bias. These results motivate the need for explicitly addressing algorithmic configuration and data properties when reporting and interpreting bias in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>OneEdit: A Neural-Symbolic Collaboratively Knowledge Editing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge representation has been a central aim of AI since its inception. Symbolic Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and neural Large Language Models (LLMs) can both represent knowledge. KGs provide highly accurate and explicit knowledge representation, but face scalability issue; while LLMs offer expansive coverage of knowledge, but incur significant training costs and struggle with precise and reliable knowledge manipulation. To this end, we introduce OneEdit, a neural-symbolic prototype system for collaborative knowledge editing using natural language, which facilitates easy-to-use knowledge management with KG and LLM. OneEdit consists of three modules: 1) The Interpreter serves for user interaction with natural language; 2) The Controller manages editing requests from various users, leveraging the KG with rollbacks to handle knowledge conflicts and prevent toxic knowledge attacks; 3) The Editor utilizes the knowledge from the Controller to edit KG and LLM. We conduct experiments on two new datasets with KGs which demonstrate that OneEdit can achieve superior performance.</description>

      <title>DV-FSR: A Dual-View Target Attack Framework for Federated Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated recommendation (FedRec) preserves user privacy by enabling decentralized training of personalized models, but this architecture is inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Significant research has been conducted on targeted attacks in FedRec systems, motivated by commercial and social influence considerations. However, much of this work has largely overlooked the differential robustness of recommendation models. Moreover, our empirical findings indicate that existing targeted attack methods achieve only limited effectiveness in Federated Sequential Recommendation (FSR) tasks. Driven by these observations, we focus on investigating targeted attacks in FSR and propose a novel dualview attack framework, named DV-FSR. This attack method uniquely combines a sampling-based explicit strategy with a contrastive learning-based implicit gradient strategy to orchestrate a coordinated attack. Additionally, we introduce a specific defense mechanism tailored for targeted attacks in FSR, aiming to evaluate the mitigation effects of the attack method we proposed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on representative sequential models.</description>

      <title>Harnessing TI Feeds for Exploitation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many organizations rely on Threat Intelligence (TI) feeds to assess the risk associated with security threats. Due to the volume and heterogeneity of data, it is prohibitive to manually analyze the threat information available in different loosely structured TI feeds. Thus, there is a need to develop automated methods to vet and extract actionable information from TI feeds. To this end, we present a machine learning pipeline to automatically detect vulnerability exploitation from TI feeds. We first model threat vocabulary in loosely structured TI feeds using state-of-the-art embedding techniques (Doc2Vec and BERT) and then use it to train a supervised machine learning classifier to detect exploitation of security vulnerabilities. We use our approach to identify exploitation events in 191 different TI feeds. Our longitudinal evaluation shows that it is able to accurately identify exploitation events from TI feeds only using past data for training and even on TI feeds withheld from training. Our proposed approach is useful for a variety of downstream tasks such as data-driven vulnerability risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Music auto-tagging in the long tail: A few-shot approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of digital music, using tags to efficiently organize and retrieve music from extensive databases is crucial for music catalog owners. Human tagging by experts is labor-intensive but mostly accurate, whereas automatic tagging through supervised learning has approached satisfying accuracy but is restricted to a predefined set of training tags. Few-shot learning offers a viable solution to expand beyond this small set of predefined tags by enabling models to learn from only a few human-provided examples to understand tag meanings and subsequently apply these tags autonomously. We propose to integrate few-shot learning methodology into multi-label music auto-tagging by using features from pre-trained models as inputs to a lightweight linear classifier, also known as a linear probe. We investigate different popular pre-trained features, as well as different few-shot parametrizations with varying numbers of classes and samples per class. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple model with pre-trained features can achieve performance close to state-of-the-art models while using significantly less training data, such as 20 samples per tag. Additionally, our linear probe performs competitively with leading models when trained on the entire training dataset. The results show that this transfer learning-based few-shot approach could effectively address the issue of automatically assigning long-tail tags with only limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Smart E-commerce Recommendations with Semantic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In e-commerce, web mining for page recommendations is widely used but often fails to meet user needs. To address this, we propose a novel solution combining semantic web mining with BP neural networks. We process user search logs to extract five key features: content priority, time spent, user feedback, recommendation semantics, and input deviation. These features are then fed into a BP neural network to classify and prioritize web pages. The prioritized pages are recommended to users. Using book sales pages for testing, our results demonstrate that this solution can quickly and accurately identify the pages users need. Our approach ensures that recommendations are more relevant and tailored to individual preferences, enhancing the online shopping experience. By leveraging advanced semantic analysis and neural network techniques, we bridge the gap between user expectations and actual recommendations. This innovative method not only improves accuracy but also speeds up the recommendation process, making it a valuable tool for e-commerce platforms aiming to boost user satisfaction and engagement. Additionally, our system ability to handle large datasets and provide real-time recommendations makes it a scalable and efficient solution for modern e-commerce challenges.</description>

      <title>GACL: Graph Attention Collaborative Learning for Temporal QoS Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of temporal QoS is crucial for maintaining service reliability and enhancing user satisfaction in dynamic service-oriented environments. However, current methods often neglect high-order latent collaborative relationships and fail to dynamically adjust feature learning for specific user-service invocations, which are critical for precise feature extraction within each time slice. Moreover, the prevalent use of RNNs for modeling temporal feature evolution patterns is constrained by their inherent difficulty in managing long-range dependencies, thereby limiting the detection of long-term QoS trends across multiple time slices. These shortcomings dramatically degrade the performance of temporal QoS prediction. To address the two issues, we propose a novel Graph Attention Collaborative Learning (GACL) framework for temporal QoS prediction. Building on a dynamic user-service invocation graph to comprehensively model historical interactions, it designs a target-prompt graph attention network to extract deep latent features of users and services at each time slice, considering implicit target-neighboring collaborative relationships and historical QoS values. Additionally, a multi-layer Transformer encoder is introduced to uncover temporal feature evolution patterns, enhancing temporal QoS prediction. Extensive experiments on the WS-DREAM dataset demonstrate that GACL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for temporal QoS prediction across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving the improvements of up to 38.80%.</description>

Abstract: Drug repurposing offers a promising avenue for accelerating drug development by identifying new therapeutic potentials of existing drugs. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework to enhance the drug repurposing process using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and knowledge integration. Our framework comprises several specialized agents: an AI Agent trains robust drug-target interaction (DTI) models; a Knowledge Graph Agent utilizes the drug-gene interaction database (DGIdb), DrugBank, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH) to systematically extract DTIs; and a Search Agent interacts with biomedical literature to annotate and verify computational predictions. By integrating outputs from these agents, our system effectively harnesses diverse data sources, including external databases, to propose viable repurposing candidates. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of our approach in not only predicting drug-disease interactions but also in reducing the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery methods. This paper highlights the scalability of multi-agent systems in biomedical research and their role in driving innovation in drug repurposing. Our approach not only outperforms existing methods in predicting drug repurposing potential but also provides interpretable results, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective drug discovery processes.</description>
