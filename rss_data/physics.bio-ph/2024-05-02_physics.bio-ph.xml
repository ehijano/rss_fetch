      <title>Transport of topological defects in a biphasic mixture of active and passive nematic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collectively moving cellular systems often contain a proportion of dead cells or non-motile genotypes. When mixed, nematically aligning motile and non-motile agents are known to segregate spontaneously. However, the role that topological defects and active stresses play in shaping the distribution of the two phases remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the behaviour of a two-dimensional binary mixture of active and passive nematic fluids to understand how topological defects are transported between the two phases and, ultimately, how this leads to the segregation of topological charges. When the activity of the motile phase is large, and the tension at the interface of motile and non-motile phases is weak, we find that the active phase tends to accumulate $+1/2$ defects and expel $-1/2$ defects so that the motile phase develops a net positive charge. Conversely, when the activity of the motile phase is comparatively small and interfacial tension is strong, the opposite occurs so that the active phase develops a net negative charge. We then use these simulations to develop a physical intuition of the underlying processes that drive the charge segregation. Lastly, we quantify the sensitivity of this process on the other model parameters, by exploring the effect that anchoring strength, orientational elasticity, friction, and volume fraction of the motile phase have on topological charge segregation. As $+1/2$ and $-1/2$ defects have very different effects on interface morphology and fluid transport, this study offers new insights into the spontaneous pattern formation that occurs when motile and non-motile cells interact.</description>

      <title>Cycling on rough roads: A model for resistance and vibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimising opposing forces is a matter of interest to most cyclists. These forces arise from passage through air ("drag") and interaction with the road surface ("resistance"). Recent work recognises that resistance forces arise not only from the deformation of the tyre ("rolling resistance") but also from irregularities in the road surface ("roughness resistance"), which lead to power dissipation in the body of the rider through vibration. The latter effect may also have an adverse impact on human health. In this work we offer a quantitative theory of roughness resistance and vibration that links these effects to a surface characterisation in terms of the International Roughness Index (IRI). We show that the roughness resistance and the Vibration Dose Value (or VDV, the usual vibration dosage metric) can be expressed in terms of elementary formulae. The roughness resistance depends only on the vertical stiffness of the bicycle and the roughness index. Surprisingly, other apparently relevant parameters, such as physiological characteristics of the bicycle rider and other features of the bicycle, do not enter. For roads of moderate roughness, roughness resistance is larger than rolling resistance. For very rough roads, roughness resistance is larger than aerodynamic drag. So only on roads of high quality (in most jurisdictions, accounting for less than 10~\% of the total) can roughness resistance be ignored. Roughness resistance can be mitigated by reducing the vertical stiffness of the bicycle. In common with other recent reports, we find that almost any cycling activity will breach public health guidelines relating to Vibration Dose Value.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Poisson effect in affine semiflexible polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stretching an elastic material along one axis typically induces contraction along the transverse axes, a phenomenon known as the Poisson effect. From these strains, one can compute the specific volume, which generally either increases or, in the incompressible limit, remains constant as the material is stretched. However, in networks of semiflexible or stiff polymers, which are typically highly compressible yet stiffen significantly when stretched, one instead sees a significant reduction in specific volume under finite strains. This volume reduction is accompanied by increasing alignment of filaments along the strain axis and a nonlinear elastic response, with stiffening of the apparent Young's modulus. For semiflexible networks, in which entropic bending elasticity governs the linear elastic regime, the nonlinear Poisson effect is caused by the nonlinear force-extension relationship of the constituent filaments, which produces a highly asymmetric response of the constituent polymers to stretching and compression. The details of this relationship depend on the geometric and elastic properties of the underlying filaments, which can vary greatly in experimental systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the nonlinear Poisson effect in an affine network model and explore the influence of filament properties on essential features of the macroscopic response, including strain-driven alignment and volume reduction.</description>

      <title>Selective social interactions and speed-induced leadership in schooling fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animals moving together in groups are believed to interact among each other with effective social forces, such as attraction, repulsion and alignment. Such forces can be inferred using 'force maps', i.e. by analysing the dependency of the acceleration of a focal individual on relevant variables. Here we introduce a force map technique suitable for the analysis of the alignment forces experienced by individuals. After validating it using an agent-based model, we apply the force map to experimental data of schooling fish. We observe signatures of an effective alignment force with faster neighbours, and an unexpected anti-alignment with slower neighbours. Instead of an explicit anti-alignment behaviour, we suggest that the observed pattern is the result of a selective attention mechanism, where fish pay less attention to slower neighbours. This mechanism implies the existence of temporal leadership interactions based on relative speeds between neighbours. We present support for this hypothesis both from agent-based modelling, as well as from exploring leader-follower relationships in the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Distinguishability of Markovian Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to distinguish between stochastic systems based on their trajectories is crucial in thermodynamics, chemistry, and biophysics. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$, quantifies the distinguishability between the two ensembles of length-$\tau$ trajectories from Markov processes A and B. However, evaluating $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$ from histograms of trajectories faces sufficient sampling difficulties, and no theory explicitly reveals what dynamical features contribute to the distinguishability. This letter provides a general formula that decomposes $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$ in space and time for any Markov processes, arbitrarily far from equilibrium or steady state. It circumvents the sampling difficulty of evaluating $D_{\text{KL}}^{AB}(0,\tau)$. Furthermore, it explicitly connects trajectory KL divergence with individual transition events and their waiting time statistics. The results provide insights into understanding distinguishability between Markov processes, leading to new theoretical frameworks for designing biological sensors and optimizing signal transduction.</description>
