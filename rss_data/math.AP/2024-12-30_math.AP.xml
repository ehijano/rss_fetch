      <title>Landau damping below survival threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish nonlinear Landau damping below survival threshold for collisionless charged particles following the meanfield Vlasov theory near general radial equilibria. In absence of collisions, the long-range Coulomb pair interaction between particles self-consistently gives rise to oscillations, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or Langmuir's oscillatory waves, that disperse in space like a Klein-Gordon's dispersive wave. As a matter of fact, there is a non-trivial survival threshold of wave numbers that characterizes the large time dynamics of a plasma: {\em phase mixing} above the threshold driven by the free transport dynamics and {\em plasma oscillations} below the threshold driven by the collective meanfield interaction. The former mechanism provides exponential damping, while the latter is much slower and dictated by Klein-Gordon's dispersion which gives decay of the electric field precisely at rate of order $t^{-3/2}$. Up to date, all the works in the mathematical literature on nonlinear Landau damping fall into the phase mixing regime, in which plasma oscillations were absent. The present work resolves the problem in the plasma oscillation regime. Our nonlinear analysis includes (1) establishing the existence and dispersion of Langmuir's waves, (2) decoupling oscillations from phase mixing in different time regimes, (3) detailing the oscillatory structure of particle trajectories in the phase space, (4) treating plasma echoes via a detailed analysis of particle-particle, particle-wave, and wave-wave interaction, and (5) designing a nonlinear iterative scheme in the physical space that captures both phase mixing and dispersion in low norms and allows growth in time in high norms. As a result, we establish nonlinear plasma oscillations and Landau damping below survival threshold for data with finite Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <title>Time-Periodic Solutions for Hyperbolic-Parabolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-periodic weak solutions for a coupled hyperbolic-parabolic system are obtained. A linear heat and wave equation are considered on two respective $d$-dimensional spatial domains that share a common $(d-1)$-dimensional interface $\Gamma$. The system is only partially damped, leading to an indeterminate case for existing theory (Galdi et al., 2014). We construct periodic solutions by obtaining novel a priori estimates for the coupled system, reconstructing the total energy via the interface $\Gamma$. As a byproduct, geometric constraints manifest on the wave domain which are reminiscent of classical boundary control conditions for wave stabilizability. We note a ``loss" of regularity between the forcing and solution which is greater than that associated with the heat-wave Cauchy problem. However, we consider a broader class of spatial domains and mitigate this regularity loss by trading time and space differentiations, a feature unique to the periodic setting. This seems to be the first constructive result addressing existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions in the heat-wave context, where no dissipation is present in the wave interior. Our results speak to the open problem of the (non-)emergence of resonance in complex systems, and are readily generalizable to related systems and certain nonlinear cases.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of Generalized Polarization Tensors vanishing structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the open problem proposed in Ammari et. al. Commun. Math.Phys, 2013. We first investigate the existence and uniqueness of Generalized Polarization Tensors (GPTs) vanishing structures locally in both two and three dimension by fixed point theorem. Employing the Brouwer Degree Theory and the local uniqueness, we prove that for any radius configuration of $N+1$ layers concentric disks (balls) and a fixed core conductivity, there exists at least one piecewise homogeneous conductivity distribution which achieves the $N$-GPTs vanishing. Furthermore, we establish a global uniqueness result for the case of proportional radius settings, and derive an interesting asymptotic configuration for structure with thin coatings. Finally, we present some numerical examples to validate our theoretical conclusions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the solution of the turbulent diffusion equation taking into account the polydispersity of the impurity and wind pickup from the underlying surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotics of a singularly perturbed problem is constructed. describing the transport of a polydisperse impurity in the atmosphere, taking into account the processes of precipitation and wind pick-up, as well as the processes of coagulation - dissociation. The mathematical model of this process represents a differential-operator equation of turbulent diffusion with a non-standard boundary condition containing two components - atmospheric and soil. The asymptotics of the solution is constructed by the method of boundary functions. Problems that do not contain small parameters are obtained for the main terms of the asymptotic equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies large solutions, for a class of quasi-linear equations involving p-Laplacian on the infinite cylindrical domains. We study the wellposedness of weak large solutions on infinite cylinders by the convergence of large solutions on finite cylinders and observe that any such solution coincides with the large solution on its cross-section. Finally, the results are generalized to a class of operators involving non-linearity in the gradient.</description>

      <title>Suppression of blow-up for the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system via the Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As is well known, for the 3D Patlak-Keller-Segel system, regardless of whether they are parabolic-elliptic or parabolic-parabolic forms, finite-time blow-up may occur for arbitrarily small values of the initial mass. In this paper, it was proved for the first time that one can prevent the finite-time blow-up when the initial mass is less than a certain critical threshold via the stabilizing effect of the moving Navier-Stokes flows. In details, we investigate the nonlinear stability of the Couette flow $(Ay, 0, 0)$ in the Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system with $(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$ and show that if the Couette flow is sufficiently strong (A is large enough), then solutions for Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system are global in time as long as the initial velocity is sufficiently small and the initial cell mass is less than $\frac{24}{5} \pi^2$.</description>

      <title>Orbital stability of smooth solitary waves for the modified Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the orbital stability of smooth solitary wave solutions to the modified Camassa-Holm equation with cubic nonlinearity. These solutions, which exist on a nonzero constant background $k$, are unique up to translation for each permissible value of $k$ and wave speed. By leveraging the Hamiltonian nature of the modified Camassa-Holm equation and employing three conserved functionals-comprising an energy and two Casimirs, we establish orbital stability through an analysis of the Vakhitov-Kolokolov condition. This stability pertains to perturbations of the momentum variable in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet energy and focusing NLS condensates of minimal intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the family of (poly)continua $\mathcal K$ in the upper half-plane ${\mathbb H} $ that contain a preassigned finite {\it anchor} set $E$. For a given harmonic external field we define a Dirichlet energy functional $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$ and show that within each ``connectivity class'' of the family, there exists a minimizing compact $\mathcal K^*$ consisting of critical trajectories of a quadratic differential. In many cases this quadratic differential coincides with the square of the real normalized quasimomentum differential ${\rm d} {\mathbf p}$ associated with the finite gap solutions of the focusing Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (fNLS) defined by a hyperelliptic Riemann surface $\mathfrak R$ branched at the points $E\cup\bar E$.
  An fNLS soliton condensate is defined by a compact $\mathcal K\subset{\mathbb H} $ (its spectral support) whereas the average intensity of the condensate is proportional to $\mathcal I(\mathcal K)$ with external field given by $\Im z$. The motivation for this work lies in the problem of soliton condensate of least average intensity such that $E$ belongs to the poly-continuum $\mathcal K$. We prove that spectral support $\mathcal K^*$ provides the fNLS soliton condensate of the least average intensity within a given ``connectivity class''.</description>

      <title>Game theoretical asymptotic mean value properties for non-homogeneous $p$-Laplace problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical mean value property for the Laplacian operator to address a nonlinear and non-homogeneous problem related to the $p$-Laplacian operator for $p&gt;2$. Specifically, we characterize viscosity solutions to the $p$-Laplace equation $\Delta_p u:=\nabla\cdot(|\nabla u|^{p-2} \nabla u) = f$ with a nontrivial right-hand side $f$, through novel asymptotic mean value formulas. While asymptotic mean value formulas for the homogeneous case ($f = 0$) have been previously established, leveraging the normalization $\Delta_p^{\text{N}}u:=|\nabla u|^{2-p} \Delta_p u = 0$, which yields the 1-homogeneous normalized $p$-Laplacian, such normalization is not applicable when $f \neq 0$. Furthermore, the mean value formulas introduced here motivate, for the first time in the literature, a game-theoretical approach for non-homogeneous $p$-Laplace equations. We also analyze the existence, uniqueness, and convergence of the game values, which are solutions to a dynamic programming principle derived from the mean value property.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of spatial convolutions by PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the approximation problem for the spatial convolution with a given integral kernel. The approximation to the spatial convolution by PDE systems has been proposed to eliminate the analytical difficulties caused by the integrals for the one-dimensional space. In this paper we establish a PDE system approximation for the spatial convolutions in higher spatial dimensions. We derive an approximation function for given arbitrary radial integral kernels by linear sums of the Green functions. In the proof of this methodology we introduce an appropriate integral transformation to show the completeness of the basis constructed by the Green functions. From this theory, it is possible to approximate the nonlocal operator of the convolution type with any radial integral kernels by the linear sum of the solutions to the PDE system. Finally, numerical examples for the approximation are demonstrated using this method.</description>

Abstract: We are devoted to the weighted estimates and the solvability of time-fractional parabolic equations with VMO coefficients in non-divergence form and divergence form in the whole space and the half space. Our results are an improvement and a supplement to that of Dong \&amp; Kim (2021, Adv.Math. 377:107494). The proofs rely on a decomposition of the solution, along with the application of the Fefferman-Stein theorem and the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function theorem in the weighted mixed spaces.</description>

      <title>Computational Assessment of Turbulent Eddy Impact on Hydrodynamic Mixing in a Stirred Tank Bioreactor with Vent based Impellers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogeneity and efficient oxygen transfer are crucial for aerobic cultures, which is popularly performed in Stirred Tank Bioreactors, through internal mechanical agitation of the impellers.Although there are a number of impeller designs for achieving this purpose, there are still concerns about the ability of the impellers to yield homogeneity and mitigate or eliminate stagnant zones.In this study, a novel impeller design, with auxiliary agitators in form of vents, was introduced and evaluated for small lab-scale bioreactors. For the evaluation, 3D models of a single and double impeller configurations, placed in two different bioreactors were developed. Computational fluid dynamics was employed to carry out the hydrodynamic simulation using k-epsilon standard model in the bioreactors.Computational variables such as the flow velocity, streamlines, pressure and wall shear stress on the shaft and impellers, eddy viscosity, turbulence eddy dissipation and turbulence kinetic energy were obtained and compared in both bioreactors to evaluate the performances at speeds of 50, 100, and 150 revolutions per minute.A comparison of the results with traditional segment-segment and segment-Rushton impellers shows that our double impeller configuration performs more desirably at speeds ranging from 100 to 150 RPM. Homogeneity was also achieved in both bioreactors, and there was significant reduction of stagnant zone less than 99 percentage in the double impeller configuration and significant mitigation in the single impeller agitation.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Harnack Principle and the 3G Principle in Fractal-Type Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a generalized version of the $3G$ Principle for Green's functions on bounded inner uniform domains in a wide class of Dirichlet spaces. In particular, our results apply to higher-dimensional fractals such as Sierpinski carpets in $\mathbf{R}^n$, $n\geq 3$, as well as generalized fractal-type spaces that do not have a well-defined Hausdorff dimension or walk dimension. This yields new instances of the $3G$ Principle for these spaces. We also discuss applications to Schr\"odinger operators.</description>

      <title>$(INV)$ condition and regularity of the inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f \colon \Omega \to \Omega' $ be a Sobolev mapping of finite distortion between planar domains $\Omega $ and $\Omega'$, satisfying the $(INV)$ condition and coinciding with a homeomorphism near $\partial\Omega $. We show that $f$ admits a generalized inverse mapping $h \colon \Omega' \to \Omega$, which is also a Sobolev mapping of finite distortion and satisfies the $(INV)$ condition.
  We also establish a higher-dimensional analogue of this result: if a mapping $f \colon \Omega \to \Omega' $ of finite distortion is in the Sobolev class $W^{1,p}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n)$ with $p &gt; n-1$ and satisfies the $(INV)$ condition, then $f$ has an inverse in $W^{1,1}(\Omega', \mathbb{R}^n)$ that is also of finite distortion.
  Furthermore, we characterize Sobolev mappings satisfying $(INV)$ whose generalized inverses have finite $n$-harmonic energy.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Boundary Control of Flexible String Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a boundary control scheme for prescribed-time (PT) stable of flexible string systems via backstepping method, and the dynamics of such systems modeled by Hamilton's principle is described as hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE). Initially, to construct a boundary controller with PT stabilization capacity, a PT stable hyperbolic PDE system with time-varying coefficient is chosen as the target system, and a corresponding Volterra integral transform with time-varying kernel function is considered. Meanwhile, the kernel equation and controller is determined by taking derivative. Then, to identify the boundary controller, the well-posedness of kernel equation is derived by means of successive approximation and mathematical induction, and the upper bound of kernel function is estimated. Furthermore, the inverse transform is proved with the help of a similar process for kernel function. Subsequently, the PT stability of closed-loop system is proved by PT stability of target system and reversible integral transform. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.</description>

      <title>A note on disjoint hypercyclicity for invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first give a note on disjoint hypercyclicity for invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$. It is already known that if a tuple of bilateral weighted shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, is disjoint hypercyclic, then non of the weighted shifts is invertible. We show that as for pseudo-shifts which is a generalization of weighted shifts, this fact is not true. We give an example of invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, which are disjoint hypercyclic and whose inverses are also disjoint hypercyclic. Next we partially answer to the open problem posed by Martin, Menet and Puig (2022)\cite{MMP22} concerned with disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic, that is, we show that as for the operators on a reflexive Banach space, reiteratively hypercyclic ones are disjoint hypercyclic if and only if they are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local Donaldson-Scaduto conjecture predicts the existence and uniqueness of a special Lagrangian pair of pants with three asymptotically cylindrical ends in the Calabi-Yau 3-fold $X \times \mathbb{R}^2$, where $X$ is an ALE hyperk\"ahler 4-manifold of $A_2$-type. The existence of this special Lagrangian has previously been proved. In this paper, we prove a uniqueness theorem, showing that no other special Lagrangian pair of pants satisfies this conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin Calculus Approach to Backward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity properties of the solutions to multi-dimensional backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs), whose (possibly random) generator reflects nonlinear dependence on both the solution process and the martingale integrand component of the adapted solutions, as well as their diagonal processes. The well-posedness results are developed with the use of Malliavin calculus, which renders a novel perspective in tackling with the challenging diagonal processes while contrasts with the existing methods. We also provide a probabilistic interpretation of the classical solutions to the counterpart semilinear partial differential equations through the explicit adapted solutions of BSVIEs. Moreover, we formulate with BSVIEs to explicitly characterize dynamically optimal mean-variance portfolios for various stochastic investment opportunities, with the myopic investment and intertemporal hedging demands being identified as two diagonal processes of BSVIE solutions.</description>

      <title>Topology of closed asymptotic curves on negatively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Nirenberg's problem on isometric rigidity of tight surfaces, we study closed asymptotic curves $\Gamma$ on negatively curved surfaces $M$ in Euclidean $3$-space. In particular, using C\u{a}lug\u{a}reanu's theorem, we obtain a formula for the linking number $Lk(\Gamma,n)$ of $\Gamma$ with the normal $n$ of $M$. It follows that when $Lk(\Gamma, n)=0$, $\Gamma$ cannot have any locally star-shaped planar projections with vanishing crossing number, which extends observations of Kovaleva, Panov and Arnold. These results hold also for curves with nonvanishing torsion and their binormal vector field. Furthermore we construct an example where $n$ is injective but $Lk(\Gamma, n)\neq 0$, and discuss various restrictions on $\Gamma$ when $n$ is injective.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger operators with non-integer power-law potentials and Lie-Rinehart algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger operators $H:= -\Delta + V$ with potentials $V$ that have power-law growth (not necessarily polynomial) at 0 and at $\infty$ using methods of Lie theory (Lie-Rinehart algebras) and microlocal analysis. More precisely, we show that $H$ is ''generated'' in a certain sense by an explicit Lie-Rinehart algebra. This allows then to construct a suitable (microlocal) calculus of pseudodifferential operators that provides further properties of $H$. Classically, this microlocal analysis method was used to study $H$ when the power-laws describing the potential $V$ have integer exponents. Thus, the main point of this paper is that this integrality condition on the exponents is not really necessary for the microlocal analysis method to work. While we consider potentials following (possibly non-integer) power-laws both at the origin and at infinity, our results extend right away to potentials having power-law singularities at several points. The extension of the classical microlocal analysis results to potentials with non-integer power-laws is achieved by considering the setting of Lie-Rinehart algebras and of the continuous family groupoids integrating them. (The classical case relies instead on Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses two significant drawbacks of an eddy viscosity turbulence model: the issue of excessive dissipation relative to energy input and the lack of a universal parameter specification. Considering the Baldwin-Lomax model with backscatter effects, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions under mild conditions. Our next result shows that this model maintains energy dissipation rates consistent with energy input, thereby avoiding over-dissipation and aligning with K41 phenomenology. Additionally, we propose a range for the model's parameters.</description>

      <title>Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann Eigenvalues on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Sigma$ in a Riemannian surface $M$ satisfying certain curvature condition, we prove that for any $k \geq 1,$ we have $$\mu_{k+2-\beta_1} \leq \lambda_{k},$$ where $\mu_k$ ($\lambda_k$ resp.) is the $k$-th Neumann (Dirichlet resp.) Laplacian eigenvalue on $\Sigma$ and $\beta_1$ is the first Betti number of $\Sigma.$ This extends previous results on the Euclidean space to curved surfaces, including the flat cylinder, the hyperbolic plane, hyperbolic cusp, funnel, etc. The novelty of the paper lies in comparing Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacian eigenvalues via the variational principle of the Hodge Laplacian on $1$-forms on a surface, extending the variational principle on vector fields in the Euclidean plane as developed by Rohleder. The comparison is reduced to the existence of a distance function with appropriate curvature conditions on its level sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide explicit description of the pinning region and propagation reversal phenomenon for the bistable reaction diffusion equation on regular biinfinite trees. In contrast to the general existence results for smooth bistabilities, the closed-form formulas are enabled by the choice of the piecewise linear McKean's caricature. We construct exact pinned waves and show their stability. The results are qualitatively similar to the propagation reversal results for smooth bistabilities. Major exception consists in the unboundedness of the pinning region in the case of the bistable McKean's caricature. Consequently, the propagation reversal also occurs for arbitrarily large diffusion.</description>

      <title>Higher-order asymptotic profiles for solutions to the Cauchy problem for a dispersive-dissipative equation with a cubic nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem for a dispersive-dissipative equation with a cubic nonlinearity. It is known that the leading term of the asymptotic profile for the solution to this problem is the Gaussian. Moreover, by analyzing the corresponding integral equation, the higher-order asymptotic expansion for the solution to the linear part and the first asymptotic profile for the Duhamel term have already been obtained. In this paper, we construct the second asymptotic profile for the Duhamel term and give the more detailed higher-order asymptotic expansion of the solutions, which generalizes the previous works. Furthermore, we emphasize that the newly obtained higher-order asymptotic profiles have a good structure in the sense of satisfying the parabolic self-similarity.</description>

      <title>On stability of self-similar blowup for mass supercritical NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mass supercritical (NLS) in dimension $d\ge 1$ in the mass-supercritical range. The existence of self-similar blow up dyamics is known [Merle-Rapha\"el-Szeftel, 2010], and suitable self-similar blow up profiles were constructed [Bahri-Martel-Rapha\"el, 2021]. In this work, we prove the finite codimensional nonlinear asymptotic stability of a large class of self-similar profiles. The heart of the proof is, following the approach of Beceanu [Beceanu, 2011], the derivation of Strichartz dispersive estimates for matrix operators with a deformed Laplacian $\Delta_b = \Delta + ib\left(\frac d2 + x\cdot\nabla\right)$ in homogeneous Sobolev spaces and energy space $H^1$. The deformed Laplacian $\Delta_b$ arises from the renormalization and its operator group $e^{it\Delta_b}$ exhibits self-similar dispersion, which not only recovers the free Strichartz but also enables an extension of resolvent families. Compared with Strichartz estimates based on $\Delta$, this one has a larger admissible region, works for arbitrarily small polynomial decaying potential, and requires no spectral assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topic of flow across an infinitely wide parabolic vertical sheet with accelerating reactions of chemicals and heating is addressed in this article. The Laplace transform method is used to rectify the dimensioned equations that govern of movement into a set of non-dimensional regulating mathematical equations of motion. It is found that thermal energy as well as chemical responses have a substantial impact on the rates of both mass and heat transmission. Using analytical formulas, create temperatures, concentrations, and velocity personas. The physical aspects of various components, including acceleration (a), thermal radiation parameter (R), chemical reaction parameter (K), thermal Grashof number (Gr), mass Grashof number (Gc), Schmidt number (Sc), Prandtl number (Pr), and time variable (t) are investigated. By drawing graphs, characteristics of the velocity, temperature, and concentration are examined.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for establishing large data local well-posedness in low regularity Sobolev spaces for general quasilinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-degenerate and nontrapping metrics. Our result represents a definitive improvement over the landmark results of Kenig, Ponce, Rolvung and Vega, as it weakens the regularity and decay assumptions to the same scale of spaces considered by Marzuola, Metcalfe, and Tataru, but removes the uniform ellipticity assumption on the metric from their result. Our method has the additional benefit of being relatively simple but also very robust. In particular, it only relies on the use of pseudodifferential calculus for classical symbols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13377v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For given functions $f$ and $j$ on the disc $B$ and its boundary $\partial B=S^1$, we study the existence of conformal metrics $g=e^{2u}g_0$ with prescribed Gauss curvature $K_g=f$ and boundary geodesic curvature $k_g=j$. Using the variational characterization of such metrics obtained by Cruz-Blazquez and Ruiz (2018), we show that there is a canonical negative gradient flow of such metrics, either converging to a solution of the prescribed curvature problem, or blowing up to a spherical cap. In the latter case, similar to our work Struwe (2005) on the prescribed curvature problem on the sphere, we are able to exhibit a $2$-dimensional shadow flow for the center of mass of the evolving metrics from which we obtain existence results complementing the results recently obtained by Ruiz (2021) by degree-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a nonlocal approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation in which we can estimate the speed of convergence to equilibrium in a way which respects the local limit of the equation. This uniform estimate cannot be easily obtained with standard inequalities or entropy methods, but can be obtained through the use of Harris's theorem, finding interesting links to quantitative versions of the central limit theorem in probability. As a consequence one can prove that solutions of this nonlocal approximation converge to solutions of the usual Fokker-Planck equation uniformly in time -- hence we show the approximation is asymptotic-preserving in this sense. The associated equilibrium has some interesting tail and regularity properties, which we also study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a universal, conceptually simple and systematic method to prove well-posedness to Cauchy problems for weak solutions of parabolic equations with non-smooth, time-dependent, elliptic part having a variational definition. Our classes of weak solutions are taken with minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution which seems new in this generality: it is shown to always coincide with the associated evolution family for the initial value problem with zero source and it yields representation of all weak solutions. Our strategy is a variational approach avoiding density arguments, a priori regularity of weak solutions or regularization by smooth operators. One of our main tools are embedding results which yield time continuity of our weak solutions going beyond the celebrated Lions regularity theorem and that is addressing a variety of source terms. We illustrate our results with three concrete applications : second order uniformly elliptic part with Dirichlet boundary condition on domains, integro-differential elliptic part, and second order degenerate elliptic part.</description>

Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to improve some of the results in \cite{BCPR}. Namely, we establish the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkwoski inequality for intrinsic volumes for origin-symmetric convex bodies that are close to the ball in the $C^2$ sense for a certain range of $p&lt;1$ (including negative values) and we prove that this inequality does not hold true in the entire class of origin-symmetric convex bodies for any $p&lt;1$. The second goal is to establish a uniqueness result for the (closely related) $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. More specifically, we show uniqueness in the symmetric case when $p\in[0,1)$ and the data function $g$ in the right hand side is sufficiently close to the constant 1. One of the main ingredients of the proof is the existence of upper and lower bounds for the (convex) solution, that depend only $\|\log g\|_{L^\infty}$, a fact that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>

Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>
