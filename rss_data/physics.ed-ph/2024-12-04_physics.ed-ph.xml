      <title>The Design and Implementation of a Quantum Information Science Undergraduate Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information science is a burgeoning research field attracting vast public and private investment in the last decade. This quick rise has led to a talent gap, where there are more open positions than new graduates who can fill these roles. To meet this critical need, higher education has been challenged to react accordingly by assuring a flow of highly skilled individuals who must be trained quickly. We thus present how Universit\'e de Sherbrooke, in Quebec, Canada, responded by creating and launching an innovative undergraduate degree in quantum information science, aiming to address this gap by training quantum software developers in three and a half years. At the end of this program, they will be ready to join the quantum workforce. We detail the creative process leading to a coherent curriculum, as well as why the local ecosystem led to these choices. The guiding principles and lessons learned during the development of this interdepartmental and interfaculty degree are shared to inspire other quantum education institutions.</description>

      <title>Teaching Quantum Formalism and Postulates to First-Year Undergraduates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to undergraduate-level quantum mechanics require extensive mathematical preparation, preventing most students from enrolling in a quantum mechanics course until the third year of a physics major. Here we describe an approach to teaching quantum formalism and postulates that can be used with first-year undergraduate students and even high school students. The only pre-requisite is a familiarity with vector dot products. This approach enables students to learn Dirac notation and core postulates of quantum mechanics at a much earlier stage in their academic career, which can help students prepare for careers in quantum science and engineering and advance the Second Quantum Revolution.</description>

      <title>Scaffold or Crutch? Examining College Students' Use and Views of Generative AI Tools for STEM Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing problem-solving competency is central to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, yet translating this priority into effective approaches to problem-solving instruction and assessment remain a significant challenge. The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT in higher education introduces new considerations about how these tools can help or hinder students' development of STEM problem-solving competency. Our research examines these considerations by studying how and why college students use genAI tools in their STEM coursework, focusing on their problem-solving support. We surveyed 40 STEM college students from diverse U.S. institutions and 28 STEM faculty to understand instructor perspectives on effective genAI tool use and guidance in STEM courses. Our findings reveal high adoption rates and diverse applications of genAI tools among STEM students. The most common use cases include finding explanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping with problem-set questions. The primary motivation for using genAI tools was to save time. Moreover, over half of student participants reported simply inputting problems for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their own problem-solving processes. These findings indicate that despite high adoption rates, students' current approaches to utilizing genAI tools often fall short in enhancing their own STEM problem-solving competencies. The study also explored students' and STEM instructors' perceptions of the benefits and risks associated with using genAI tools in STEM education. Our findings provide insights into how to guide students on appropriate genAI use in STEM courses and how to design genAI-based tools to foster students' problem-solving competency.</description>

      <title>The time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillator: a pedagogical approach via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics courses, students often solve the Schr\"odinger equation for the harmonic oscillator with time-independent parameters. However, time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillators are relevant in modeling several problems as, for instance, the description of quantum motion of particles in traps, shortcuts to adiabaticity, as well as quantum scalar fields evolving in expanding universes. In the present paper, we discuss, with a pedagogical approach, the quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method, revisiting the main steps to obtain the wave function associated with this model, and briefly discussing the relation between this oscillator and the generation of squeezed states. As examples of didactic applications of time-dependent harmonic oscillators and the Lewis-Riesenfeld method in quantum mechanics courses, we solve the following problems: the calculation of the transition probability associated with a harmonic oscillator which undergoes jumps in its frequency, and the analysis of the dynamics of a quantum particle in a Paul trap.</description>
