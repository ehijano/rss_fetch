      <title>Phase-Controlled Ramsey Interference of XUV Photoelectrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Ramsey-type quantum interference in photoelectron momentum distributions generated by two time-delayed, linearly polarized extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses. The electron dynamics are studied by solving the full-dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation within the single-active-electron approximation for neon initially prepared in a current-carrying $2p_+$ state. The coherent superposition of electron wave packets released by the two pulses gives rise to pronounced interference fringes in both energy-resolved spectra and angle-resolved momentum distributions. We demonstrate that the fringe positions are governed by a Ramsey phase accumulated during the interpulse delay, resulting in a linear dependence on the relative carrier-envelope phase and an inverse scaling of the fringe spacing with the delay time. By systematically varying the laser intensity, we establish that the observed modulations originate from temporal quantum interference rather than Autler--Townes splitting. Analysis of the time-resolved bound-state population dynamics reveals that carrier-envelope-phase dependent bound--bound coupling dominated by transient population transfer to the $2s$ state, which controls the interference contrast. The accumulated phase is further interpreted in terms of a dynamic Stark shift of the dressed bound states, which is quantitatively reproduced using a reduced two-level model.</description>

      <title>Identifying Mechanism of Energy-Resolved Attoclock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study above-threshold ionization (ATI) of atoms in strong elliptical laser fields numerically and analytically. Recent benchmark experiments for H showed that the attoclock offset angle related to each ATI ring increases remarkably with energy and this characteristic phenomenon can be attributed to the laser-induced nonadiabatic initial velocity and position of the electron at the tunnel exit [PRL127, 273201 (2021)]. However, the specific mechanism of how the nonadiabatic effects influence this angle remains unclear. Here, by using a strong-field model that analytically and quantitatively decouples complex nonadiabatic effects and Coulomb effects, the detailed mechanism can be clearly identified. We show that due to nonadiabatic effects, the angles associated with lower (higher) energy rings are dominated by the main (minor) axis of the laser ellipse, jumping from $0^o$ to $90^o$. These field-related rigid effects are softened by Coulomb-induced exit velocity closely related to system symmetry, resulting in a significant but smooth increase in angle with energy.</description>

      <title>Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy of oriented targets and magnetic transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron beam energies in Transmission Electron Microscopes (TEMs) reach the relativistic realm constituting Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) the appropriate framework for the study of electron matter interaction in TEMs. We focus on the inelastic scattering of relativistic electrons from a generic oriented target. The inelastic differential cross section factorizes to the fast electron part which is calculated analytically, and the dynamic form factor of the target, which encodes the response of the medium to the interaction with the beam. The properties of the dynamic form factor of oriented targets are analyzed. We then derive the scattering cross section of electrons by magnetic targets where spin-flip transitions are induced. We comment on the kinematic regimes where the coefficient of the transverse magnetic interaction is amplified compared to the coulomb matrix element.</description>

      <title>Vorticity-Crystalline Order Coupling in Supersolids: Excitations and Re-entrant Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05846v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotation is a natural tool in ultracold gases to break time-reversal symmetry, yet its impact on the collective excitations of supersolids remains largely unexplored. We show theoretically that tuning the rotation frequency, rather than the interparticle interactions, can trigger the superfluid-to-supersolid transition in Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order.</description>

      <title>Many-body and QED effects in electron-atom inelastic scattering in EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elemental composition and electronic-structure of materials analyzed by Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) are probed by the inner-shell ionization of atoms. We calculate the inelastic differential cross-section perturbatively within the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The interaction between the incoming electron and the atom factorizes into a high-energy electron term and the atomic transition current. The matrix elements of the transition current are computed within the relaxed Dirac-Hartree-Fock method. We analyze the correlation effects arising from the relaxation of the atomic orbitals induced by the creation of a core hole. These effects are particularly relevant in quantum many-body systems and have a significant impact on the shape of the differential cross-section near the ionization threshold in EELS spectra. This is a localized process that can be approximated by the scattering of an electron beam from a free atom. In addition to the continuum, we calculate the discrete excitation spectrum of $\mathrm{DyScO_3}$ using crystal field multiplet theory. The calculated spectrum shows very good agreement with experimental EELS data.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of $p$-wave contacts in a harmonically trapped Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dependence of the $p$-wave contact on the Fermi temperature $T_F$ and reduced temperature $T/T_F$ based on the number of closed-channel molecules. From the anisotropic pattern of dissociated molecules, we resolve the narrow $m=0$ and $m=\pm1$ dipolar splitting of the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance in $^6$Li, enabling the independent determination of the contact for all three $m$ components. For each component, we identify a near-resonant scaling with $\sqrt{T_F}$, indicating the contribution of the normalized effective range $k_F R_{\rm{e}}$. In addition, we show that the peak contacts observed near resonance increase as $T/T_F$ is lowered, a trend that is accurately captured by estimates based on the second-order virial expansion. Our results, together with estimates from the $p$-wave virial expansion, provide a route toward a complete understanding of the thermodynamics of resonantly enhanced $p$-wave Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Astigmatism-free 3D Optical Tweezer Control for Rapid Atom Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of neutral atoms are a leading platform for quantum computing, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 200 $\mu$m $\times$ 136 $\mu$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.</description>
