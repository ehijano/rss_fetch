      <title>Tuning spin-density separation via finite-range interactions: Dimensionality-driven signatures in dynamic structure factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-density separation, marked by distinct propagation velocities of spin and density excitations, epitomizes strong correlations, historically confined to one-dimensional (1D) systems. Recent ultracold quantum gas experiments, however, demonstrate its emergence in higher dimensions through precise tuning of intra- to interspecies interaction ratios, inspiring exploration of how dimensionality and interatomic interactions govern quantum correlations. We investigate this in two-component bosonic mixtures with finite-range interactions, probing 1D and three-dimensional (3D) dynamics. Using effective field theory within the one-loop approximation, we derive analytical expressions for zero-temperature ground-state energy and quantum depletion, seamlessly recovering contact interaction results in the contact limit. By crafting an effective action for decoupled density and spin modes, we compute dynamic structure factors (DSFs), revealing how finite-range interactions sculpt spin-density separation. A pivotal finding is the dimensionality-driven divergence in DSF peak dynamics: in 1D, peaks ascend to higher frequencies with increasing interaction strength, yielding sharp responses; in 3D, peaks descend to lower frequencies, with broader density wave profiles. These insights highlight dimensionality's critical role in collective excitations and provide a robust theoretical blueprint for probing interaction-driven quantum phenomena via Bragg spectroscopy, paving new pathways for exploring dimensionally tuned quantum correlations in ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Coherent tunneling of collective excitation of Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson effect can be observed in a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential, which is attributed to the tunneling of bosons between two wells. We propose a multi-mode theory to investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a one-dimensional condensate in a double-well potential. We show that the system can be described by two independent two-mode models. The Josephson oscillation and the self-trapping of local collective excitations are predicted analytically and confirmed by numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Microgravity-assisted off-axis spin vortex in a $^{87}$Rb dipolar spinor Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of the ground state of a spin vortex in a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate with the assistance of an optical plug has been studied. However, gravity is everywhere, and this potential linear dependence on the spatial position will destroy the axisymmetric structure of the system with the optical plug. In this case, the question of whether the spin vortex ground state still exists remains unresolved. The present study aims to explore the impact of microgravity on the formation of the spin vortex state with the assistance of an optical plug. To this end, a simple model has been employed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. The Gross-Pitaevskii equations are solved by setting the optical plug intensity, adjusting the optical plug width, and adjusting the microgravity strength. This process results in the phase diagram for the single-mode state and spin vortex state. Under microgravity situations, we observe an off-axis structure of the spin vortex state. Our calculations offer a reliable approach to generating spin vortex states in a microgravity environment.</description>

      <title>Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $\mathcal{T}$ and some other symmetry operation $\mathcal{O}$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $\mathcal{O}$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mixtures of moir\'e excitons have arisen as a platform for realizing novel phases of light and matter. Here, we study moir\'e polaritons coupled to a Bose-Einstein condensate of dark-state excitons confined to a moir\'e superlattice. We develop a variational approach to analyze the optical response of the system and demonstrate that strong exciton-exciton interactions significantly modify the character of moir\'e polaritons, leading to sizable energy shifts of the avoided crossing between the principal polariton branches, and the emergence of an additional, stable repulsive-polariton bound state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlators at finite density and temperature encode important information about a physical system, such as transport and causality. For a massive gas of particles in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory, we provide complete analytic results for all first order transport coefficients, including thermoelectric coefficients. We demonstrate the first complete picture of the complex structure of the correlators as a function of mass, providing an interpretation in terms of the causal structure of lightcones. We provide a simple criterion to extract the effective lightcone velocity from the cut of the retarded correlator.</description>

      <title>Fast, continuous and coherent atom replacement in a neutral atom qubit array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors are a promising platform for scalable quantum computing. An obstacle to implementing deep quantum circuits is managing atom loss, which constitutes a significant fraction of all errors. Current approaches are either not capable of replacing lost atoms in the middle of a circuit -- and therefore restricted to fixed, short circuit depths -- or require more than an order of magnitude longer time than gate and measurement operations to do so. In this work, we demonstrate fast, continuous atom replacement leveraging the metastable $^{171}$Yb qubit. A continuously loaded reservoir near the computation zone enables on-demand atom extraction with tweezers up to 500 times per second. New qubit arrays can be prepared 30 times per second when including single-atom preparation, non-destructive imaging and initialization. Importantly, existing qubits are completely undisturbed by the reloading process, owing to the extreme isolation of the metastable qubit from cooling and imaging light. This work establishes a complete foundation for implementing fast quantum circuits with unlimited depth, removing a final roadblock for fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism in the crossover between the square and triangular lattice Fermi-Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</description>

      <title>Stability and decay of subradiant patterns in a quantum gas with photon-mediated interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastability and its relaxation mechanisms challenge our understanding of the stability of quantum many-body systems, revealing a gap between the microscopic dynamics of the individual components and the effective descriptions used for macroscopic observables. We observe excited self-ordered subradiant patterns in a quantum gas coupled to two optical cavities and report lifetimes far beyond the system's typical timescales. These patterns eventually decay through an abrupt transition reordering the atoms into a superradiant phase. Ab-initio theory fully captures this macroscopic behavior, revealing that the subradiant patterns are stabilized by photon-mediated long-range interactions, thereby manifesting universal features of metastability characteristic of long-range interacting systems, as in astrophysics and plasma physics. Our work sheds light on the microscopic mechanisms stabilizing quantum states of matter and highlights the potential of photon-mediated forces for engineering correlations in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic scaling of vorticity in phase-separating superfluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been experimentally confirmed that non-equilibrium dynamics of phase separation in strongly ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensates of $^7$Li atoms obey the dynamic scaling law belonging to the binary-fluid universality class in the inertial hydrodynamic stage. The current work theoretically and numerically studies the dynamic scaling law of structure factor of vorticity in a phase-separating binary superfluid mixture, equivalent to the $^7$Li condensates in a strong limit of quadratic Zeeman shift. We found a dynamic scaling law for the structure factor based on our numerical observation that the peak of the energy spectrum from turbulence theory does not vary in time in the stage. Similarly to freely decaying turbulence, a power-law hierarchy exists in the energy spectrum in our system, and we proposed a decay law of the energy based on the dynamic scaling law by introducing the microscopic, high-wavenumber cutoff.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking direct and indirect dipolar spin-exchange interactions between two Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced F\"orster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</description>

      <title>Analytical Prediction of the Superradiant Emission Peak and Timing in Fully Excited Quantum Emitter Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>
