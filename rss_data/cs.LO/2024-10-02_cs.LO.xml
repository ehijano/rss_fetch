      <title>Disconnection Rules are Complete for Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a category theoretical framework capturing two approaches to graph-based models of chemistry: formal reactions and disconnection rules. We model a translation from the latter to the former as a functor, which is faithful, and full up to isomorphism. This allows us to state, as our main result, that the disconnection rules are sound, complete and universal with respect to the reactions. Concretely, this means that every reaction can be decomposed into a sequence of disconnection rules in an essentially unique way. This provides a uniform way to store reaction data, and gives an algorithmic interface between (forward) reaction prediction and (backward) reaction search or retrosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Finite element method. Detailed proofs to be formalized in Coq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To obtain the highest confidence on the correction of numerical simulation programs for the resolution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), one has to formalize the mathematical notions and results that allow to establish the soundness of the approach. The finite element method is one of the popular tools for the numerical resolution of a wide range of PDEs. The purpose of this document is to provide the formal proof community with very detailed pen-and-paper proofs for the construction of the Lagrange finite elements of any degree on simplices in positive dimension.</description>

      <title>Towards a Law of Iterated Expectations for Heuristic Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Christiano et al. (2022) define a *heuristic estimator* to be a hypothetical algorithm that estimates the values of mathematical expressions from arguments. In brief, a heuristic estimator $\mathbb{G}$ takes as input a mathematical expression $Y$ and a formal "heuristic argument" $\pi$, and outputs an estimate $\mathbb{G}(Y \mid \pi)$ of $Y$. In this work, we argue for the informal principle that a heuristic estimator ought not to be able to predict its own errors, and we explore approaches to formalizing this principle. Most simply, the principle suggests that $\mathbb{G}(Y - \mathbb{G}(Y \mid \pi) \mid \pi)$ ought to equal zero for all $Y$ and $\pi$. We argue that an ideal heuristic estimator ought to satisfy two stronger properties in this vein, which we term *iterated estimation* (by analogy to the law of iterated expectations) and *error orthogonality*.
  Although iterated estimation and error orthogonality are intuitively appealing, it can be difficult to determine whether a given heuristic estimator satisfies the properties. As an alternative approach, we explore *accuracy*: a property that (roughly) states that $\mathbb{G}$ has zero average error over a distribution of mathematical expressions. However, in the context of two estimation problems, we demonstrate barriers to creating an accurate heuristic estimator. We finish by discussing challenges and potential paths forward for finding a heuristic estimator that accords with our intuitive understanding of how such an estimator ought to behave, as well as the potential applications of heuristic estimators to understanding the behavior of neural networks.</description>

      <title>A complete formalization of Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize a complete proof of the regular case of Fermat's Last Theorem in the Lean4 theorem prover. Our formalization includes a proof of Kummer's lemma, that is the main obstruction to Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes. Rather than following the modern proof of Kummer's lemma via class field theory, we prove it by using Hilbert's Theorems 90-94 in a way that is more amenable to formalization.</description>

      <title>Locality Theorems in Semiring Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12627v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiring semantics of first-order logic generalises classical Boolean semantics by permitting truth values from a commutative semiring, which can model information such as costs or access restrictions. This raises the question to what extent classical model theoretic properties still apply, and how this depends on the algebraic properties of the semiring.
  In this paper, we study this question for the classical locality theorems due to Hanf and Gaifman. We prove that Hanf's Locality Theorem generalises to all semirings with idempotent operations, but fails for many non-idempotent semirings. We then consider Gaifman normal forms and show that for formulae with free variables, Gaifman's Theorem does not generalise beyond the Boolean semiring. Also for sentences, it fails in the natural semiring and the tropical semiring. Our main result, however, is a constructive proof of the existence of Gaifman normal forms for min-max and lattice semirings. The proof implies a stronger version of Gaifman's classical theorem in Boolean semantics: every sentence has a Gaifman normal form which does not add negations.</description>

      <title>Unifying Asynchronous Logics for Hyperproperties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a powerful hyper logical framework in the linear-time setting, we call generalized HyperLTL with stuttering and contexts (GHyperLTL_SC for short). GHyperLTL_SC unifies known asynchronous extensions of HyperLTL and the well-known extension KLTL of LTL with knowledge modalities under both the synchronous and asynchronous perfect recall semantics. As a main contribution, we individuate a meaningful fragment of GHyperLTL_SC, we call simple GHyperLTL_SC, with a decidable model-checking problem, which is more expressive than HyperLTL and known fragments of asynchronous extensions of HyperLTL with a decidable model-checking problem. Simple GHyperLTL_SC subsumes KLTL under the synchronous semantics and the one-agent fragment of KLTL under the asynchronous semantics, and to the best of our knowledge, it represents the unique hyper logic with a decidable model-checking problem which can express powerful non-regular trace properties when interpreted on singleton sets of traces. We justify the relevance of simple GHyperLTL_SC by showing that it can express diagnosability properties, interesting classes of information-flow security policies, both in the synchronous and asynchronous settings, and bounded termination (more in general, global promptness in the style of Prompt LTL).</description>

      <title>LogicAsker: Evaluating and Improving the Logical Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LogicAsker, a novel approach for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Despite LLMs' prowess in tasks like writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation, assessing their ability to reason has been challenging. Traditional evaluations often prioritize accuracy on downstream tasks over direct assessments of reasoning processes. LogicAsker addresses this gap by employing a set of atomic reasoning skills grounded in propositional and predicate logic to systematically examine and improve the reasoning prowess of LLMs. Our methodology reveals significant gaps in LLMs' learning of logical rules, with identified reasoning failures ranging from 29\% to 90\% across different models. Moreover, we leverage these findings to construct targeted demonstration examples and fine-tune data, notably enhancing logical reasoning in models like GPT-4o by up to 5\%. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to utilize test case outcomes to effectively refine LLMs' formal reasoning capabilities. We make our code, data, and results publicly available (https://github.com/yxwan123/LogicAsker) to facilitate further research and replication of our findings.</description>

      <title>Learning Explainable and Better Performing Representations of POMDP Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strategies for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) typically require memory. One way to represent this memory is via automata. We present a method to learn an automaton representation of a strategy using a modification of the L*-algorithm. Compared to the tabular representation of a strategy, the resulting automaton is dramatically smaller and thus also more explainable. Moreover, in the learning process, our heuristics may even improve the strategy's performance. In contrast to approaches that synthesize an automaton directly from the POMDP thereby solving it, our approach is incomparably more scalable.</description>
