      <title>The Zakharov System on the Upper Half-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Zakharov system on the upper half--plane $U=\{(x ,y)\in \R^2: y&gt;0\}$ with non-homogenous boundary conditions. In particular we obtain low regularity local well--posedness using the restricted norm method of Bourgain and the Fourier--Laplace method of solving initial and boundary value problems. Moreover we prove that the nonlinear part of the solution is in a smoother space than the initial data. To our knowledge this is the first paper which establishes low regularity results for the 2d initial-boundary value Zakharov system.</description>

      <title>A regularization of incompressible Stokes problem with Tresca friction condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, we introduce and study a model addressing the Stokes problem with non-linear boundary conditions of the Tresca type. We suggest a new procedure for regularizing incompressible fluid, i.e. we assume that the divergence $\nabla \cdot {\bf u}\in [-\epsilon,\,\epsilon]$ which leads to class of constrained elliptic variational inequalities. We use a fixed point strategy to show the existence and uniqueness of a solution and we reformulate the problem as an equivalent constrained minimization problem. An ADMM is applied to the minimization problem and some algorithm are provided.</description>

      <title>Large-Time Asymptotics for Hyperbolic Systems with Non-Symmetric Relaxation: An Algorithmic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of one-dimensional linear hyperbolic systems with non-symmetric relaxation. Introducing a new frequency-dependent Kalman stability condition, we prove an abstract decay result underpinning a form of inhomogeneous hypocoercivity. In contrast with the homogeneous setting, the decay rates depend on how the Kalman condition is fulfilled and, in most cases, a loss of derivative occurs: one must assume an additional regularity assumption on the initial data to ensure the decay. Under structural assumptions, we refine our abstract result by providing an algorithm, of wide applicability, for the construction of Lyapunov functionals. This allows us to systematically establish decay estimates for a given system and uncover algebraic cancellations (beyond the reach of the Kalman-based approach) reducing the loss of derivatives in high frequencies. To demonstrate the applicability of our method, we derive new stability results for the Sugimoto model, which describes the propagation of nonlinear acoustic waves, and for a beam model of Timoshenko type with memory.</description>

      <title>Relationship between haptotaxis and chemotaxis in cell dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon where cells with elongated protrusions, such as neurons, communicate by contacting other cells and arrange themselves appropriately is termed cell sorting through haptotaxis. This phenomenon is described by partial differential equations involving nonlocal advection. In contrast, cell phenomena where cells communicate with other cells via chemical substances and arrange themselves appropriately are termed cell sorting through chemotaxis, typically modeled by chemotactic systems such as the Keller--Segel model. Although there are clear differences between haptotaxis and chemotaxis, similar behaviors are often observed. In this study, we investigate the relationship between haptotaxis and chemotaxis in cell sorting phenomena. Specifically, we analyze the connections between a nonlocal aggregation model for haptotaxis and a Keller--Segel type chemotaxis system. By demonstrating convergence under specific kernel approximations, we show how these distinct mechanisms can lead to comparable dynamic behaviors. This study provides a mathematical framework for understanding the interplay between haptotaxis and chemotaxis in cell sorting phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional Burgers' equation forced by fractional derivative of order $\frac{1}{2}$ applied on space-time white noise. Relying on the approaches of Anderson Hamiltonian from Allez and Chouk (2015, arXiv:1511.02718 [math.PR]) and two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations forced by space-time white noise from Hairer and Rosati (2024, Annals of PDE, \textbf{10}, pp. 1--46), we prove the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of its mild and weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity Results for Mixed Local Nonlocal Equations With Indefinite Concave-Convex Type Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the multiplicity of non-negative solutions for a class of equations involving mixed local-nonlocal nonhomogeneous operator. The problem features indefinite concave-convex nonlinearities with sign-changing weights and a parameter $\lambda$. The nonlinearity combines sublinear and superlinear growth terms, which can be either subcritical or critical. Our analysis is based on the study of fibering maps and the minimization of the associated energy functional over appropriate subsets of the Nehari manifold. For a specific operator, we establish a nonexistence result for sufficiently large $\lambda$ in the subcritical case. The proof relies on a generalized eigenvalue problem for mixed local-nonlocal operators, whose key properties we develop as part of our analysis.</description>

      <title>On the eigenvalues and Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k spectrum of $p$-Laplace local and nonlocal operator with mixed interpolated Hardy term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we are concerned with the eigenvalue problem driven by the mixed local and nonlocal $p$-Laplacian operator having the interpolated Hardy term \begin{equation*} \mathcal{T}(u) :=- \Delta_p u + (- \Delta_p)^s u - \mu \frac{|u|^{p-2}u}{|x|^{p \theta}}, \end{equation*} where $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;p&lt;N$, $\theta \in [s,1]$, and $\mu \in (0,\mu_0(\theta))$. First, we establish a mixed interpolated Hardy inequality and then show the existence of eigenvalues and their properties. We also investigate the Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k spectrum, the existence of the first nontrivial curve in the Fu\v{c}\'{\i}k spectrum, and prove some of its properties. Moreover, we study the shape optimization of the domain with respect to the first two eigenvalues, the regularity of the eigenfunctions, the Faber-Krahn inequality, and a variational characterization of the second eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>The transition problem between time-independent motions of a body in a viscous liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A body $\mathscr B$ moves in an unbounded Navier-Stokes liquid by time-independent translatory motion. Suppose that at time $t=0$, $\mathscr B$ smoothly changes its motion to an arbitrary rigid motion, reached at time $t=1$. We then show that the associated Navier-Stokes problem has a unique solution connecting the two steady-states generated by the motion of $\mathscr B$, provided all the involved velocities of $\mathscr B$ are sufficiently small.</description>

      <title>A Note on Continuous dependence of Navier-Stokes equations with oscillating force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the averaging effect of a highly oscillating external force on the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. We show that, as long as the force time-average decays over time, if the frequency and amplitude of the oscillating force grow, then the corresponding solutions to Navier-Stokes equations converge (in a suitable topology) to the solution of the homogeneous equations with same initial data. Our approach involves reformulating the system as an abstract evolution equation in a Banach space, and then proving continuous dependence of solutions on both initial conditions and the external forcing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global existence of weak solutions to 3-D inhomogeneous incompressible MHD equations with variable viscosity and resistivity, which is sufficiently close to $1$ in $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3),$ provided that the initial density is bounded from above and below by positive constants, and both the initial velocity and magnetic field are small enough in the critical space $\dot{H}^{\frac{1}{2}}(\mathbb{R}^3).$ Furthermore, if we assume in addition that the kinematic viscosity equals $1,$ and both the initial velocity and magnetic field belong to $\dot{B}^{\frac{1}{2}}_{2,1}(\mathbb{R}^3),$ we can also prove the uniqueness of such solution.</description>

      <title>Radial symmetry, uniqueness and non-degeneracy of solutions to degenerate nonlinear Sch\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the radial symmetry, uniqueness and non-degeneracy of solutions to the degenerate nonlinear elliptic equation $$ -\nabla \cdot \left(|x|^{2a} \nabla u\right) + \omega u=|u|^{p-2}u \quad \mbox{in} \,\, \mathbb{R}^d, $$ where $d \geq 2$, $0&lt;a&lt;1$, $\omega&gt;0$ and $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2d}{d-2(1-a)}$. We proved that any ground state is radially symmetric and strictly decreasing in the radial direction. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of ground states and derive the non-degeneracy of ground states in the corresponding radially symmetric Sobolev space. This affirms the nature conjectures posed recently in \cite{IS}.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Limit of Strong Solutions to the Diffuse Interface Model for Two-phase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the incompressible limit problem for strong solutions of compressible two-phase flow models under periodic boundary conditions, where the Navier-Stokes equations are nonlinearly coupled with either Cahn-Hilliard equations or Allen-Cahn equations. The viscosity coefficients are allowed to depend both on the density and the phase field variable. We establish rigorous convergence of both local and global strong solutions of compressible systems to their incompressible systems as the Mach number tends to zero.This theoretical framework establishes an essential linkage between compressible and incompressible phase field models, demonstrating that both formulations exhibit consistent physical fidelity in capturing interfacial flow dynamics.Furthermore, we provide some convergence rate estimates of the solutions.</description>

  \mathcal{F}(u,\Omega):= \, \int_\Omega \sum_{i=1}^{n} \, a_i(x) \lvert u_{x_i} \rvert^{p_i} dx, \end{equation*} with exponents $p_i \geq 2$ and with coefficients $a_i(x)$ that satisfy a suitable Sobolev regularity. The main result is obtained, as usual, by imposing a gap bound on the exponents $p_i$, which depends on the dimension and on the degree of regularity of the coefficients $a_i(x)$</description>

      <title>A Variable Coefficient Free Boundary Problem for $L^p$-solvability of Parabolic Dirichlet Problems in Graph Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate variable coefficient analogs of a recent work of Bortz, Hofmann, Martell and Nystr\"om [BHMN25]. In particular, we show that if $\Omega$ is the region above the graph of a Lip(1,1/2) (parabolic Lipschitz) function and $L$ is a parabolic operator in divergence form \[L = \partial_t - \text{div} A \nabla\] with $A$ satisfying an $L^1$ Carleson condition on its spatial and time derivatives, then the $L^p$-solvability of the Dirichlet problem for $L$ and $L^*$ implies that the graph function has a half-order time derivative in BMO. Equivalently, the graph is parabolic uniformly rectifiable.
  In the case of $A$ symmetric, we only require that the Dirichlet problem for $L$ is solvable, which requires us to adapt a clever integration by parts argument by Lewis and Nystr\"om. A feature of the present work is that we must overcome the lack of translation invariance in our equation, which is a fundamental tool in similar works, including [BHMN25].</description>

      <title>Stability of a Stationary Solution to a 1-D Model for the MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of a one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model (1-D MHD) with mixed vortex stretching effects, introduced by Dai, Vyas, and Zhang. Using techniques similar to those developed by Lei, Liu, and Ren for the De Gregorio equation, we establish global-in-time well-posedness for initial data near a stationary point. Our result is analogous to the exponential stability of the ground state of the De Gregorio equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the direct application of the relativistic extended thermodynamics theory of polyatomic gases developed in [Ann. Phys. 377 (2017) 414--445] to the relativistic BGK model proposed by Marle. We present the perturbed Marle model around the generalized J\"{u}ttner distribution and investigate the properties of the linear operator. Then we prove the global existence and large-time behavior of classical solutions when the initial data is sufficiently close to a global equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Boundary determination for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with unknown embedded obstacles by local data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inverse boundary value problem of the elliptic operator $\Delta+q$ in a fixed region $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ with unknown embedded obstacles $D$. In particular, we give a new and simple proof to uniquely determine $q$ and all of its derivatives at the boundary from the knowledge of the local Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on $\partial\Omega$, disregarding the unknown obstacle, where in fact only the local Cauchy data of the fundamental solution is used. Our proof mainly depends on the rigorous singularity analysis on certain singular solutions and the volume potentials of fundamental solution, which is easy to extend to many other cases.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Euler-Voigt equations to the Euler equations in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the two-dimensional torus and we study
  the convergence of solutions of the Euler-Voigt equations to
  solutions of the Euler equations, under several regularity
  settings. More precisely, we first prove that for weak solutions of the
  Euler equations with vorticity in $C([0,T];L^2(\mathbb{T}^2))$ the
  approximating velocity converges strongly in
  $C([0,T];H^1(\mathbb{T}^2))$. Moreover, for the unique Yudovich solution of
  the $2D$ Euler equations we provide a rate of convergence for the
  velocity in $C([0,T];L^2(\mathbb{T}^2))$. Finally, for classical solutions
  in higher-order Sobolev spaces we prove the convergence with
  explicit rates of both the approximating velocity and the
  approximating vorticity in $C([0,T];L^2(\mathbb{T}^2))$.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the critical $p$-Laplace equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $1&lt;p&lt;n$, it is well-known that non-negative, energy weak solutions to $\Delta_p u + u^{p^{\ast}-1} =0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are completely classified. Moreover, due to a fundamental result by Struwe and its extensions, this classification is stable up to bubbling.
  In the present work, we investigate the stability of perturbations of the critical $p$-Laplace equation for any $1&lt;p&lt;n$, under a condition that prevents bubbling. In particular, we show that any solution $u \in \mathcal{D}^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to such a perturbed equation must be quantitatively close to a bubble. This result generalizes a recent work by the first author, together with Figalli and Maggi (Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN 2018 (2018), no. 21, 6780-6797), in which a sharp quantitative estimate was established for $p=2$. However, our analysis differs completely from theirs and is based on a quantitative $P$-function approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with an inverse nodal problem for the Dirac differential operator with the discontinuity conditions inside the interval. We obtain a new approach for asymptotic expressions of the solutions and prove that the coefficients of the Dirac system can be determined uniquely by a dense subset of the nodal points (zeros of the first component of the eigenfunction). We also provide an algorithm for constructing the solution of this inverse nodal problem.</description>

      <title>Large-time estimates for the Dirichlet heat equation in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give large-time asymptotic estimates, both in uniform and $L^1$ norms, for solutions of the Dirichlet heat equation in the complement of a bounded open set of $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying certain technical assumptions. We always assume that the initial datum has suitable finite moments (often, finite first moment). All estimates include an explicit rate of approach to the asymptotic profiles at the different scales natural to the problem, in analogy with the Gaussian behaviour of the heat equation in the full space. As a consequence we obtain by an approximation procedure the asymptotic profile, with rates, for the Dirichlet heat kernel in these exterior domains. The estimates on the rates are new even when the domain is the complement of the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$, except for previous results by Uchiyama in dimension 2, which we are able to improve in some scales. We obtain that the heat kernel behaves asymptotically as the heat kernel in the full space, with a factor that takes into account the shape of the domain through a harmonic profile, and a second factor which accounts for the loss of mass through the boundary. The main ideas we use come from entropy methods in PDE and probability, whose application seems to be new in the context of diffusion problems in exterior domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies some $L^p-L^q$ estimates for the dissipative or conservative Moore-Gibson-Thompson (MGT) equations in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our contributions are twofold. By applying the Fourier analysis associated with the modified Bessel function in the dissipative case, we derive some $L^p-L^q$ estimates of solutions. Then, introducing a good unknown related to the free wave equation in the conservative case, some $L^p-L^q$ estimates of solutions with the admissible closed triangle range of exponents are deduced. These results show some essential influences of dissipation from the MGT equations in the $L^q$ framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine semiclassical measures for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact hyperbolic $(n+1)$-manifolds. We prove their support must contain the cosphere bundle of a compact immersed totally geodesic submanifold. Our proof adapts the argument of Dyatlov and Jin to higher dimensions and classifies the closures of horocyclic orbits using Ratner theory. An important step in the proof is a generalization of the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen to Fourier integral operators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Multi-index Based Solution Theory to the $\Phi^4$ Equation in the Full Subcritical Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain (small-parameter) well-posedness for the (space-time periodic) $\Phi^4$ equation in the full subcritical regime in the context of regularity structures based on multi-indices. As opposed to Hairer's more extrinsic tree-based setting, due to the intrinsic description encoded by multi-indices, it is not possible to obtain a solution theory via the standard fixed-point argument. Instead, we develop a more intrinsic approach for existence using a variant of the continuity method from classical PDE theory based on a priori estimates for a new `robust' formulation of the equation. This formulation also allows us to obtain uniqueness of solutions and continuity of the solution map in the model norm even at the limit of vanishing regularisation scale. Since our proof relies on the structure of the nonlinearity in only a mild way, we expect the same ideas to be sufficient to treat a more general class of equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work in a class of Sobolev $W^{1,p}$ maps, with $p &gt; d-1$, from a bounded open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ that do not exhibit cavitation and whose trace on $\partial \Omega$ is also $W^{1,p}$. Under the assumptions that the Jacobian is positive and the deformation can be approximated on the boundary by injective maps, we show that the deformation is injective. We prove the existence of minimizers in this class for functionals accounting for a nonlinear elastic energy and a boundary energy. The energy density in $\Omega$ is assumed to be polyconvex, while the energy density in $\partial \Omega$ is assumed to be tangentially polyconvex, a new type of polyconvexity on $\partial \Omega$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we rigorously derive the fundamental PDEs of fluid mechanics, such as the compressible Euler and incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, starting from the hard sphere particle systems undergoing elastic collisions. This resolves Hilbert's sixth problem, as it pertains to the program of deriving the fluid equations from Newton's laws by way of Boltzmann's kinetic theory. The proof relies on the derivation of Boltzmann's equation on 2D and 3D tori, which is an extension of our previous work (arXiv:2408.07818).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $M\subset \mathbb{R}^{d\geq 3}$ a smooth, connected, compact $d$-dimensional submanifold with boundary, equipped with the standard metric, the Laplacian on $\partial M$ is known to commute with the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann map if and only if $M$ is a ball. In this paper, we investigate the $d=2$ case and show that, surprisingly, there exists a one-parameter family of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^2$ as above for which the boundary Laplacian and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map commute, thus answering an open problem posed by Girouard, Karpukhin, Levitin, and Polterovich. We then classify all such Riemannian surfaces of genus $0$ or whose boundary has $k\geq 3$ connected components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetric Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces, which may possess both strongly local and pure-jump parts. We introduce a new formulation of a tail condition for jump measures and weighted functional inequalities. Our framework accommodates Dirichlet forms with singular jump measures and those associated with trace processes of mixed-type stable processes. Using these new weighted functional inequalities, we establish stable, equivalent characterizations of H\"older regularity for caloric and harmonic functions. As an application of our main result, we prove the H\"older continuity of caloric functions for a large class of symmetric Markov processes exhibiting boundary blow-up behavior, among other results.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a full discretization procedure to solve wave beam propagation in random media modeled by a paraxial wave equation or an It\^o-Schr\"odinger stochastic partial differential equation. This method bears similarities with the phase screen method used routinely to solve such problems. The main axis of propagation is discretized by a centered splitting scheme with step $\Delta z$ while the transverse variables are treated by a spectral method after appropriate spatial truncation. The originality of our approach is its theoretical validity even when the typical wavelength $\theta$ of the propagating signal satisfies $\theta\ll\Delta z$. More precisely, we obtain a convergence of order $\Delta z$ in mean-square sense while the errors on statistical moments are of order $(\Delta z)^2$ as expected for standard centered splitting schemes. This is a surprising result as splitting schemes typically do not converge when $\Delta z$ is not the smallest scale of the problem. The analysis is based on equations satisfied by statistical moments in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger case and on integral (Duhamel) expansions for the paraxial model. Several numerical simulations illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for the stochastic primitive equations in the large rotation limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the unique ergodicity of the viscous primitive equations with additive white-in-time noise remains an open problem. In this work, we demonstrate that, as the rotational intensity approaches infinity, the distribution of any given strong solution, rescaled by the rotation, is attracted to the unique invariant measure of the stochastic limit resonant system. This suggests that the system exhibits nearly unique ergodicity in the large rotation limit. The proof is based on a stochastic averaging principle combined with a coupling argument.</description>

      <title>Non Null-Controllability Properties of the Grushin-Like Heat Equation on 2D-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the internal non null-controllability properties of the heat equation on 2-dimensional almost-Riemannian manifolds with an interior singularity, and under the assumption that the closure of the control zone does not contain the whole singularity. We show that if locally, around the singularity, the sub-Riemannian metric can be written in a Grushin form, or equivalently the sub-Laplacian writes as a generalized Grushin operator, then, achieving null-controllability requires at least a minimal amount of time. As locally the manifold looks like a rectangular domain, we consequently focus ourselves on the non null-controllability properties of the generalized Grushin-like heat equation on various Euclidean domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a class of general nonlinear epidemic models with age and space structure, including a nonlocal infection term depending on age and space. After establishing the well-posedness of the state partial differential equation, we introduce a control parameter interpreted as a vaccination rate. Under certain conditions, we show that an optimal control exists and how it can be characterized by first-order optimality conditions. Finally, we present numerical examples of the optimal control problems governed by these models.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the Neumann and Steklov principal eigenvalues emerging from the study of collapsing convex domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Such a relationship allows us to give a partial proof of a conjecture concerning estimates of the ratio of the former to the latter: we show that thinning triangles maximize the ratio among convex thinning sets, while thinning rectangles minimize the ratio among convex thinning with some symmetry property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Strichartz estimates for the $(k,a)$-generalized Laguerre operators $a^{-1}\bigl(-|x|^{2-a}\Delta_k+|x|^a\bigr)$ which were introduced by Ben Sa\"{\i}d-Kobayashi-Orsted, and for the operators $|x|^{2-a}\Delta_k$. Here $k$ denotes a non-negative multiplicity function for the Dunkl Laplacian $\Delta_k$ and $a$ denotes a positive real number satisfying certain conditions. The cases $a=1,2$ were studied previously. We consider more general cases here. The proof depends on symbol-type estimates of special functions and a discrete analog of the stationary phase theorem inspired by the work of Ionescu-Jerison.</description>

      <title>New Revival Phenomena for Bidirectional Dispersive Hyperbolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the dispersive revival and fractalization phenomena for bidirectional dispersive equations on a bounded interval subject to periodic boundary conditions and discontinuous initial profiles are investigated. Firstly, we study the periodic initial-boundary value problem of the linear beam equation with step function initial data, and analyze the manifestation of the revival phenomenon for the corresponding solution at rational times. Next, we extend the investigation to periodic initial-boundary value problems of more general bidirectional dispersive equations. We prove that, if the initial functions are of bounded variation, the dynamical evolution of such periodic problems depend essentially upon the large wave number asymptotics of the associated dispersion relations. Integral polynomial or asymptotically integral polynomial dispersion relations produce dispersive revival/fractalization rational/irrational dichotomies, whereas those with non-polynomial growth result in fractal profiles at all times. Finally, numerical experiments, in the concrete case of the nonlinear beam equation, are used to demonstrate how such effects persist into the nonlinear regime.</description>

Abstract: We prove boundedness and regularity estimates for weak solutions to a class of linear nonlocal equations involving integro-differential operators with almost no order of differentiability. In particular, we show that bounded weak solutions are continuous, and we provide a uniform a-priori estimates for the modulus of continuity. In contrast to earlier works, we allow the nonlocal operators to be highly anisotropic and weakly singular, and we allow the associated kernel functions to vanish close to the singularity.</description>

      <title>Wigner Representation of Schr\"odinger Propagators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a Wigner analysis of Fourier integral operators (FIOs), whose main examples are Schr\"odinger propagators arising from quadratic Hamiltonians with bounded perturbations. The perturbation is given by a pseudodifferential operator $\sigma(x,D)$ with symbol in the H\"ormander class $S^0_{0,0}(\mathbb{R}^{2d})$. We compute and study the Wigner kernel of these operators. They are special instances of a more general class of FIOs named $FIO(S)$, with $S$ the symplectic matrix representing the classical symplectic map. We shall show the algebra and the Wiener's property of this class. The algebra will be the fundamental tool to represent the Wigner kernel of the Schr\"odinger propagator for every $t\in\mathbb{R}^d$, also in the caustic points. This outcome underlines the validity of the Wigner analysis for the study of Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of nonlinear Fokker-Planck type equations in a bounded domain with periodic boundary conditions. The system is motivated by our study of grain boundary dynamics, especially under the non-isothermal environments. To obtain the long time behavior of the solutions, in particular, the exponential decay, the kinematic structures of the systems are investigated using novel reinterpretation of the classical entropy method.</description>

      <title>On a degenerate second order traffic model: existence of discrete evolutions, deterministic many-particle limit and first order approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09834v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new microscopic second order Follow-the-Leader type scheme to describe traffic flows. The main novelty of this model consists in multiplying the second order term by a nonlinear function of the global density, with the intent of considering the attentiveness of the drivers in dependence on the amount of congestion. Such term makes the system highly degenerate; indeed, coherently with the modellistic viewpoint, we allow for the nonlinearity to vanish as soon as consecutive vehicles are very close to each other. We first show existence of solutions to the degenerate discrete system. We then perform a rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit, as the number of vehicles grows larger and larger, by making use of suitable piece-wise constant approximations of the relevant macroscopic variables. The resulting continuum system turns out to be described by a degenerate pressure-less Euler-type equation, and we discuss how this could be considered an alternative to the groundbreaking Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model. Finally, we study the singular limit to first order dynamics in the spirit of a vanishing-inertia argument. This eventually validates the use of first order macroscopic models with nonlinear mobility to describe a congested traffic stream.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of global-in-time weak solutions to volume-preserving mean curvature flow with in the presence of obstacles by the phase field method in all dimensions. Namely, we prove the convergence of solutions to the Allen-Cahn equation with a multiplier to a weak solution to the flow. The choice of the multiplier is motivated from [Mugnai-Seis-Spadaro '16], [Kim-Kwon '20], and [Takasao '23], which enables us to complete the comparison between the multiplier and the forcing that stops the intrusion into the obstacle. We also prove the vanishing of the discrepancy measure by dealing with the forcing term that is now spatially dependent due to the obstacles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an axially-symmetric, $(n+1)$-dimensional convex cone $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, we study the stability of the free-boundary minimal surface $\Sigma$ obtained by intersecting $\Omega$ with a $n$-plane that contains the axis of $\Omega$. In the case $n=2$, $\Sigma$ is always unstable, as a special case of the vertex-skipping property recently proved in a paper by the same authors. Conversely, as soon as $n \ge 3$ and $\Omega$ has a sufficiently large aperture (depending on the dimension $n$), we show that $\Sigma$ is strictly stable. For our stability analysis, we introduce a Lipschitz flow $\Sigma_{t}[f]$ of deformations of $\Sigma$ associated with a compactly-supported, scalar deformation field $f$, which satisfies the key property $\partial \Sigma_{t}[f] \subset \partial \Omega$ for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$. Then, we compute the lower-right second variation of the area of $\Sigma$ along the flow, and ultimately show that it is positive by exploiting its connection with a functional inequality studied in the context of reaction-diffusion problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of estimating the operator norm of the embeddings between multidimensional weighted Paley-Wiener spaces. These can be equivalently thought as Fourier uncertainty principles for bandlimited functions. By means of radial symmetrization mechanisms, we show that such problems can all be shifted to dimension one. We provide precise asymptotics in the general case and, in some particular situations, we are able to identify the sharp constants and characterize the extremizers. The sharp constant study is actually a consequence of a more general result we prove in the setup of de Branges spaces of entire functions, addressing the operator given by multiplication by $z^k$, $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Applications to sharp higher order Poincar\'{e} inequalities and other related extremal problems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of Markov semigroups associated with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes driven by L\'evy processes. These semigroups are generated by non-local, non-self-adjoint operators. In the special case where the driving L\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical diffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied over past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable conditions on the L\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\'evy-OU semigroup in the $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of the diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for eigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent of the choice of the L\'evy process. A key ingredient in our approach is intertwining relationship: we prove that every L\'evy-OU semigroup is intertwined with a diffusion OU semigroup. Additionally, we examine the compactness properties of these semigroups and provide examples of non-compact L\'evy-OU semigroups.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems related to electrical networks and the geometry of non-negative Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a new solution of the classical black box problem (the discrete Calderon problem) in the theory of circular electrical networks. Our approach is based on the explicit embedding of electrical networks into non-negative Grassmannians and generalized chamber ansatz for it. Additionally, we reveal the relationship of this problem with combinatorial properties of spanning groves and the theory of the totally non-negative matrices.
  Key words: electrical networks, discrete Calderon problem, discrete electrical impedance tomography, non-negative Grassmannians, twist for positroid variety, Temperley trick, totally non-negative matrices, effective resistances.</description>
