      <title>Bi-Filtration and Stability of TDA Mapper for Point Cloud Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carlsson, Singh and Memoli's TDA mapper takes a point cloud dataset and outputs a graph that depends on several parameter choices. Dey, Memoli, and Wang developed Multiscale Mapper for abstract topological spaces so that parameter choices can be analyzed via persistent homology. However, when applied to actual data, one does not always obtain filtrations of mapper graphs. DBSCAN, one of the most common clustering algorithms used in the TDA mapper software, has two parameters, \textbf{$\epsilon$} and \textbf{MinPts}. If \textbf{MinPts = 1} then DBSCAN is equivalent to single linkage clustering with cutting height \textbf{$\epsilon$}. We show that if DBSCAN clustering is used with \textbf{MinPts $&gt;$ 2}, a filtration of mapper graphs may not exist except in the absence of free-border points; but such filtrations exist if DBSCAN clustering is used with \textbf{MinPts = 1} or \textbf{2} as the cover size increases, \textbf{$\epsilon$} increases, and/or \textbf{MinPts} decreases. However, the 1-dimensional filtration is unstable. If one adds noise to a data set so that each data point has been perturbed by a distance at most \textbf{$\delta$}, the persistent homology of the mapper graph of the perturbed data set can be significantly different from that of the original data set. We show that we can obtain stability by increasing both the cover size and \textbf{$\epsilon$} at the same time. In particular, we show that the bi-filtrations of the homology groups with respect to cover size and $\epsilon$ between these two datasets are \textbf{2$\delta$}-interleaved.</description>

      <title>Averaging formulas for the Reidemeister trace, Lefschetz and Nielsen numbers of $n$-valued maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $n$-valued self-map $f$ of a closed manifold $X$, we prove an averaging formula for the Reidemeister trace of $f$ in terms of the Reidemeister coincidence traces of single-valued maps between finite orientable covering spaces of $X$. We then derive analogous formulas for the Lefschetz and Nielsen numbers of $f$. In the special case where $X$ is an infra-nilmanifold, we obtain explicit formulas for the Lefschetz and Nielsen numbers of any $n$-valued map on $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study diagonal arrangement complements $D(K)$ in $\mathbb{C}^m$. We consider the class of simplicial complexes $K$ in which any two missing faces have a common vertex, and prove that the coordinate arrangement complement $U(K)$ is the double suspension of the diagonal arrangement complement $D(K)$. In the case of subspace arrangements in $\mathbb{R}^m$ the coordinate arrangement complement $U_{\mathbb{R}}(K)$ is the single suspension of $D_{\mathbb{R}}(K)$.</description>

      <title>Enhancement for categories and homotopical algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop foundations for abstract homotopy theory based on Grothendieck's idea of a "derivator". The theory is model-independent, and does not depend on model categories, nor on simplicial sets. It is designed to accomodate all the usual potential applications, such as e.g. enhancements for derived categories of coherent sheaves, in a way that is as close as possible to usual category theory.</description>

      <title>Polynomial stability of the homology of Hurwitz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$ and a conjugation-invariant subset $Q\subseteq G$, we consider the Hurwitz space $\mathrm{Hur}_n(Q)$ parametrising branched covers of the plane with $n$ branch points, monodromies in $G$ and local monodromies in $Q$. For $i\ge0$ we prove that $\bigoplus_n H_i(\mathrm{Hur}_n(Q))$ is a finitely generated module over the ring $\bigoplus_n H_0(\mathrm{Hur}_n(Q))$. As a consequence, we obtain polynomial stability of homology of Hurwitz spaces: taking homology coefficients in a field, the dimension of $H_i(\mathrm{Hur}_n(Q))$ agrees for $n$ large enough with a quasi-polynomial in $n$, whose degree is easily bounded in terms of $G$ and $Q$. Under suitable hypotheses on $G$ and $Q$, we prove classical homological stability for certain sequences of components of Hurwitz spaces. Our results generalise previous work of Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland, and rely on techniques introduced by them and by Hatcher-Wahl.</description>

      <title>Spaces over BO are thickened manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the topologically enriched category of compact smooth manifolds (possibly with corners), with morphisms given by codimension zero smooth embeddings. Now formally identify any object X with its thickening X x [-1,1]. We prove that the resulting infinity-category of thickened smooth manifolds is equivalent to the infinity-category of finite spaces over BO. (This is one formalization of the philosophy that embedding questions become homotopy-theoretic upon passage to higher dimensions.) The central tool is a geometric construction of pushouts in this infinity-category, carried out with an eye toward proving analogous results in exact symplectic geometry. Notably, the proof never invokes smooth approximation nor any h-principle.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove the PL analogue of the theorem of Galatius, Madsen, Tillmann, and Weiss which describes the homotopy type of the smooth cobordism category. More specifically, we introduce the PL Madsen-Tillmann spectrum $\mathbf{MT}PL(d)$ and prove that there is a weak homotopy equivalence of the form $B\mathsf{Cob}^{\mathrm{PL}}_d \simeq \Omega^{\infty-1}\mathbf{MT}PL(d)$. We also discuss how to adjust the methods of this paper to obtain the topological version of our main result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we generalize the theory of minimal models in rational homotopy theory to the context of persistence. Our main motivation is the computation of an explicit finite, cellular presentation of the persistent minimal model that computes persistent rational type of copersistent simply-connected spaces. We give an explicit construction of minimal models of maps between commutative differential-graded algebras, which we use to construct minimal models of tame persistent CDGAs. We then build a model structure on persistent CDGAs for which these minimal models become cell complexes. As an application of our results, we construct an explicit rational Postnikov tower of a simply-connected copersistent spaces.</description>

      <title>Density Sensitive Bifiltered Dowker Complexes via Total Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new density-sensitive bifiltrations for data using the framework of Dowker complexes.
  Previously, Dowker complexes were studied to address directional or bivariate data whereas density-sensitive bifiltrations on \v{C}ech and Vietoris--Rips complexes were suggested to make them more robust, while increasing computational complexity.
  We combine these two lines of research, noting that the superlevels of the total weight function of a Dowker complex can be identified as an instance of Sheehy's multicover filtration.
  We prove a version of Dowker duality that is compatible with this filtration and show that it corresponds to the multicover nerve theorem.
  As a consequence, we find that the subdivision intrinsic \v{C}ech complex admits a smaller model.
  Moreover, regarding the total weight function as a counting measure, we generalize it to arbitrary measures and prove a density-sensitive stability theorem for the case of probability measures.
  As an application, we propose a robust landmark-based bifiltration which approximates the multicover bifiltration.
  Additionally, we provide an algorithm to calculate the appearances of simplices in our bifiltration and present computational examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and study an equivariant analogue of Cohen, Farber and Weinberger's parametrized topological complexity. We show that several results in the non-equivariant case can be extended to the equivariant case. For example, we establish the fibrewise equivariant homotopy invariance of the sequential equivariant parametrized topological complexity. We obtain several bounds on sequential equivariant topological complexity involving equivariant category. We also obtain the cohomological lower bound and the dimension-connectivity upper bound on the sequential equivariant parametrized topological complexity. In the end we use these results to compute sequential equivariant parametrized topological complexity of equivariant Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations and some equivariant fibrations involving generalized projective product spaces.</description>

      <title>Determination of the fifth Singer algebraic transfer in some degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P_k$ be the graded polynomial algebra $\mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k]$ over the prime field $\mathbb F_2$ with two elements and the degree of each variable $x_i$ being 1, and let $GL_k$ be the general linear group over $\mathbb F_2$ which acts on $P_k$ as the usual manner. The algebra $P_k$ is considered as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\mathcal A$. In 1989, Singer [22] defined the $k$-th homological algebraic transfer, which is a homomorphism $$\varphi_k :{\rm Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+d} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2) \to (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P_k)_d^{GL_k}$$ from the homological group of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\mbox{Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+d} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2)$ to the subspace $(\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P_k)_d^{GL_k}$ of $\mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k$ consisting of all the $GL_k$-invariant classes of degree $d$.
  In this paper, by using the results of the Peterson hit problem we present the proof of the fact that the Singer algebraic transfer of rank five is an isomorphism in the internal degrees $d= 20$ and $d = 30$. Our result refutes the proof for the case of $d=20$ in Ph\'uc [17].</description>

      <description>arXiv:1608.06236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a bordism category $\mathcal{C}_d^{PL}$ whose objects are bundles of closed $(d-1)$-dimensional piecewise linear manifolds and whose morphisms are bundles of $d$-dimensional piecewise linear cobordisms. In the main theorem of this article, we show that the classifying space $B\mathcal{C}_d^{PL}$ is weak homotopy equivalent to an infinite loop space. We regard $\mathcal{C}_d^{PL}$ as the piecewise linear analogue of the category of smooth cobordisms which has been studied extensively in connection to the Madsen-Weiss Theorem, and the main result of this paper is a first step towards obtaining Madsen-Weiss type results in the context of piecewise linear topology.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a geometric method to study additive combinatorial problems. Using equivariant cohomology we reprove the Dias da Silva-Hamidoune theorem. We improve a result of Sun on the linear extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Heilbronn conjecture. We generalize a theorem of G. K\'os (the Grashopper problem) which in some sense is a simultaneous generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Heilbronn conjecture. We also prove a signed version of the Erd\H{o}s-Heilbronn conjecture and the Grashopper problem. Most identities used are based on calculating the projective degree of an algebraic variety in two different ways.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a jointly conservative family of geometric functors between rigidly-compactly generated tensor triangulated categories induces a surjective map on Balmer spectra. From this we deduce a fiberwise criterion for Balmer's comparison map to be a continuous bijection. This gives short alternative proofs of the Hopkins--Neeman theorem and its generalization, due to Lau, to the case of a finite group acting trivially on an affine scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our aim is to determine the regular homotopy classes of immersions related to Arnol'd's simple singularities. For every type of simple singularities, we determine the regular homotopy class of the inclusion map of the link into the 5-sphere. We further show that the inclusion map is regularly homotopic to the immersion associated with the corresponding Dynkin diagram, which was constructed by Kinjo. We prove these by computing the complete invariants of the immersions given by Wu and Saeki--Sz\H{u}cs--Takase. As an application, we also determine the Smale invariants of Kinjo's immersions.</description>

      <title>The bounded cohomology of transformation groups of Euclidean spaces and discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the groups of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are boundedly acyclic, in all regularities. This is the first full computation of the bounded cohomology of a transformation group that is not compactly supported, and it implies that many characteristic classes of flat $\mathbb{R}^n$- and $S^n$-bundles are unbounded. We obtain the same result for the group of homeomorphisms of the disc that restrict to the identity on the boundary, and for the homeomorphism group of the non-compact Cantor set. In the appendix, Alexander Kupers proves a controlled version of the annulus theorem which we use to study the bounded cohomology of the homeomorphism group of the discs.</description>

Unusual features of this dimension are that every complex vector bundle is determined up to stable isomorphism by its Chern classes, that every even cohomology class arises as a Chern class of a vector bundle, and that $K^0(X)$ is completely determined as a ring by knowledge of the even-dimensional cohomology ring $H^{\text{even}}(X; \mathbb Z)$. (All of these fail in high dimensions.)</description>
