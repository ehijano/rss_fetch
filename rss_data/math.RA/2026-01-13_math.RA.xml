      <title>The Geometric Origin of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem: A Constructive Proof via Dimensional Syzygy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is a derived consequence of a more fundamental dimensional constraint: the syzygy formed by the tensor product of two Levi-Civita symbols, which vanishes identically in m-dimensional space. By shifting perspective from the tensor A to the isotropic operators that induce A's invariants through contraction, we reveal that the Cayley-Hamilton identity emerges when this vanishing operator acts on the m-fold tensor product of A. The intrinsic tensorial form of the theorem--invariant coefficients multiplying tensor powers--is inherited from the contraction structure rather than imposed ad hoc. We provide explicit verification for two-dimensional space and a dimension-independent proof using Laplace expansion combined with Newton-Girard identities. This framework clarifies why the theorem's structure depends on ambient dimension and suggests extensions to higher-order tensors where classical characteristic polynomial methods fail.</description>

      <title>Certificate for Orthogonal Equivalence of Real Polynomials by Polynomial-Weighted Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ and $g(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ are two real polynomials of degree $d$ in $n$ variables. If the polynomials $f$ and $g$ are the same up to orthogonal symmetry a natural question is then what element of the orthogonal group induces the orthogonal symmetry; i.e. to find the element $R\in O(n)$ such that $f(Rx)=g(x)$. One may directly solve this problem by constructing a nonlinear system of equations induced by the relation $f(Rx)=g(x)$ along with the identities of the orthogonal group however this approach becomes quite computationally expensive for larger values of $n$ and $d$. To give an alternative and significantly more scalable solution to this problem, we introduce the concept of Polynomial-Weighted Principal Component Analysis (PW-PCA). We in particular show how PW-PCA can be effectively computed and how these techniques can be used to obtain a certificate of orthogonal equivalence, that is we find the $R\in O(n)$ such that $f(Rx)=g(x)$.</description>

      <title>Commutativity criteria for prime rings with involution via pairs of endomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate central-valued identities involving pairs of endomorphisms on prime rings equipped with an involution of the second kind. Extending the recent contributions of Mir et al. (2020) and Boua et al. (2024), we establish several new commutativity criteria for such rings in the presence of two distinct nontrivial endomorphisms. Our approach provides a unified technique that covers multiple classes of $\ast$-identities and yields generalizations of earlier single-endomorphism results. Moreover, explicit counterexamples are constructed to demonstrate the necessity of the hypotheses on primeness and on the nature of the involution.</description>

      <title>Relative Invariants from Moving Frames on an Extended Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A constructive modification of the moving frame method is developed in this paper for the construction of relative invariants of regular Lie group actions. Let a relative invariant $I$ of weight $\omega$ transform according to the rule $$ I(g \cdot \boldsymbol x) = \mu(g, \boldsymbol x)^{\omega} I(\boldsymbol x), $$ where $\mu: G \times \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\times$ is a scalar multiplier (1-cocycle). It is shown that the cocycle property of $\mu$ is equivalent to the well-definedness of the twisted group action on the extended manifold $\widehat{\mathcal{M}} = \mathcal{M} \times \mathbb{R}^\times$, and that relative invariants on $\mathcal{M}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with absolute invariants of this action on $\widehat{\mathcal{M}}$.
  The main result is that, given a moving frame, the invariantization of the multiplier is a canonical relative invariant of weight $-1$. This enables the constructive realization of any weight and yields an explicit formula for an arbitrary relative invariant in terms of the fundamental absolute invariants and the invariantized multiplier. Examples are provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach for the projective group $PGL(3, \mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Massively Parallel Reductions in Multivariate Polynomial Systems: Bridging the Symbolic Preprocessing Gap on GPGPU Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gr\"obner basis computation over multivariate polynomial rings remains one of the most powerful yet computationally hostile primitives in symbolic computation. While modern algorithms (Faug\`ere-type F4 and signature-based F5) reduce many instances to large sparse linear algebra over finite fields, their dominant cost is not merely elimination but the symbolic preprocessing that constructs Macaulay-style matrices whose rows encode shifted reducers. This phase is characterized by dynamic combinatorics (monomial discovery, sparse row assembly, and deduplication) and is typically memory-latency bound, resisting naive parallelization.
  This article develops a rigorous synthesis that reframes S-polynomial reduction as syzygy discovery: row construction is a structured map from module relations to the kernel of a massive, sparse, highly non-random Macaulay matrix A over Fp. Building on this viewpoint, we propose a GPU-targeted architecture that (i) converts dynamic symbolic data structures into static, two-pass allocations via prefix-sum planning; (ii) enforces coalesced memory access through structure-of-arrays polynomial layouts and sorted monomial dictionaries; and (iii) integrates finite-field arithmetic kernels (Montgomery/Barrett-style reduction) at register granularity. On the linear-algebra side, we explore the transition from classical Gaussian elimination to parallel structured Gaussian elimination (PSGE) and to Krylov-type kernel solvers (Block Wiedemann/Lanczos) that better match GPU throughput while controlling fill-in.
  The result is a principled bridge between algebraic syzygy theory and SIMT hardware constraints, isolating the true bottleneck and providing a pathway to massively parallel reductions for multivariate polynomial systems.</description>

      <title>Normalized Rank- and Determinant-Preserving Mappings of Locally Matrix Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a unital locally matrix algebra. Among the examples of such algebras are: (1) an infinite tensor product $\otimes M_{n_i}(\mathbb{F})$ of matrix algebras over a field $\mathbb{F}$, and (2) the Clifford algebra of a nondegenerate quadratic form on an infinite-dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from $2$.
  We describe linear mappings $A \to B$ between unital locally matrix algebras that preserve the normalized rank. When $\mathbb{F}$ is a field of real or complex numbers, we also describe linear mappings $A \to A$ that preserve the normalized determinant.</description>

      <title>Idempotents and Powers of Ideals in Quandle Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses two central problems in the theory of quandle rings. First, motivated by Conjecture 3.10 in Internat. J. Math. 34 (2023), no. 3, Paper No. 2350011: for a semi-latin quandle $X$, every nonzero idempotent in the integral quandle ring $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ necessarily corresponds to an element of $X$, we investigate idempotents in quandle rings of semi-latin quandles. Precisely, we prove that if the ground ring is an integral domain with unity, then the quandle ring of Core($\mathbb{Z}$) admits only trivial idempotents. Second, powers of augmentation ideals in quandle rings have only been computed in few cases previously. We extend the computations to include dihedral quandles and commutative quandles. Finally, we examine idempotents in quandle rings of $2$-almost latin quandles and apply these results to compute the automorphism groups of their integral quandle rings.</description>

      <title>On Lie Groups Preserving Subspaces of Degenerate Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Lie groups in degenerate geometric (Clifford) algebras that preserve four fundamental subspaces determined by the grade involution and reversion under the adjoint and twisted adjoint representations. We prove that these Lie groups can be equivalently defined using norm functions of multivectors applied in the theory of spin groups. We also study the corresponding Lie algebras. Some of these Lie groups and algebras are closely related to Heisenberg Lie groups and algebras. The introduced groups are interesting for various applications in physics and computer science, in particular, for constructing equivariant neural networks.</description>

      <title>Central polynomials of minimal degree for matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formanek made the conjecture that the minimal degree of the central polynomials for the $n\times n$ matrix algebra over a field of characteristic 0 is $(n^2+3n-2)/2$ and this is true for $n\leq 3$. For $n=4$ there are examples of central polynomials of degree $13=(4^2+3\cdot 4-2)/2$ and we do not know whether there are central polynomials of lower degree. In this paper we discuss methods for searching for central polynomials of low degree and prove that the algebra of $4\times 4$ matrices does not have central polynomials in two variables of degree $\leq 12$. As a byproduct of our computations we obtain that this algebra does not have also polynomial identities in two variables of degree $\leq 12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A band is a semigroup in which each element is idempotent. In recent years, there has been a lot of activity on the representation theory of the subclass of left regular bands due to connections to Markov chains associated to hyperplane arrangements, oriented matroids, matroids and CAT(0) cube complexes. We prove here that the integral semigroup algebra of a band is isomorphic to the integral path algebra of a quiver modulo an admissible ideal. This leads to a uniform bound quiver presentation for band algebras over all fields. Also, we answer a question of Margolis, Saliola and Steinberg by proving that the integral semigroup algebra of a CW left regular band is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral path algebra of the Hasse diagram of its support semilattice modulo the ideal generated by the sum of all paths of length two. This includes, for example, hyperplane face semigroup algebras.</description>

      <title>On the Enumeration of Generalized Cospectral Mates of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the enumeration of generalized cospectral mates of simple graphs, where the generalized spectrum consists of the spectra of a graph and its complement. Moving beyond the classical problem of identifying graphs determined by their generalized spectrum, we address the more quantitative question of how many non-isomorphic graphs can share the same generalized spectrum. Our approach is based on arithmetic constraints derived from the Smith Normal Form (SNF) of the walk matrix $W(G)$, which lead to a tight upper bound on the number of generalized cospectral mates of a graph. Our upper bound applies to a much broader class of graphs than those previously shown to have no generalized cospectral mates (determined by generalized spectrum). Consequently, this work extends the family of graphs for which strong and informative spectral uniqueness</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. Given a restricted Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $p$ and a post-Lie operation over it, we prove the Jacobson identities for a $p$-structure built from the Lie bracket and the post-Lie operation, called sub-adjacent $p$-structure. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions for the sub-adjacent Lie algebra to be restricted if equipped with this sub-adjacent $p$-structure. This construction is ''axiomatized'' by introducing the notion of restricted post-Lie algebras, and we work out several examples.</description>

      <title>Skew Laurent Series and General Cyclic Convolutional Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional codes were originally conceived as vector subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of Laurent series having a polynomial basis. Piret and Roos modeled cyclic structures on them by adding a module structure over a finite-dimensional algebra skewed by an algebra automorphism. These cyclic convolutional codes turn out to be equivalent to some right ideals of a skew polynomial ring built from the automorphism. When a skew derivation is considered, serious difficulties arise in defining such a skewed module structure on Laurent series. We discuss some solutions to this problem which involve a purely algebraic treatment of the left skew Laurent series built from a left skew derivation of a general coefficient ring, when possible.</description>

      <title>Parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation: p-racks, solutions &amp; quantum algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is established from a purely algebraic point of view. The first step towards this objective is the introduction of certain generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks called parametric (p)-shelves and racks. These objects satisfy a parametric self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Novel, non-reversible solutions are obtained from p-shelf/rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all reversible set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the identity map via a parametric twist. The universal algebras associated to both p-rack and generic parametric, set-theoretic solutions are next presented and the corresponding universal R-matrices are derived. The admissible universal Drinfel'd twist is constructed allowing the derivation of the general set-theoretic universal R-matrix. By introducing the concept of a parametric coproduct we prove the existence of a parametric co-associativity. We show that the parametric coproduct is an algebra homomorphism and the universal R-matrices satisfy intertwining relations with the algebra coproducts</description>

      <title>On a minimal free resolution of the residue field over a local ring of codepth 3 of class $T$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be any noetherian local ring with residue field $k$, and $A$ the homology of the Koszul complex on a minimal set of generators of the maximal ideal of $R$. In this paper, we show that a minimal free resolution of $k$ over $R$ can be obtained from a graded minimal free resolution of $k$ over $A$. More precisely, this is done by the iterated mapping cone construction, introduced by the authors in a previous work, using specific choices of ingredients. As applications, using this general perspective, we exhibit a minimal free resolution of $k$ over a complete intersection ring of any codepth, and explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of $k$ over a noetherian local ring of codepth 3 of class $T$ in terms of Koszul blocks.</description>

      <title>Finite fields whose members are the sum of a potent and a 5-potent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there are only finitely many finite fields whose members are the sum of an $n$-potent element and a $5$-potent element. Combining this with the algorithmic results provided by S.D. Cohen {\it et al.}, we confirm in the affirmative the conjecture in \cite{Cohen} concerning all finite fields satisfying this condition. Furthermore, we obtain several elementary results for General problem, proving that the number of finite fields satisfying general condition is also finite.</description>

      <title>$SL_2$-tilings with translational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $SL_2$-tiling is a bi-infinite matrix in which all adjacent $2 \times 2$ minors are equal to $1$. Positive integral $SL_2$-tilings were introduced by Assem, Reutenauer and Smith as generalisations of classical Conway--Coxeter frieze patterns. We show that positive integral $SL_2$-tilings with translational symmetry are in bijection with triangulations of annuli. We use this correspondence to study the properties of periodic positive integral $SL_2$-tilings.</description>

      <title>Proof-Carrying Verification for ReLU Networks via Rational Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks are piecewise-linear (PWL), so universal linear safety properties can be reduced to reasoning about linear constraints. Modern verifiers rely on SMT(LRA) procedures or MILP encodings, but a safety claim is only as trustworthy as the evidence it produces. We develop a proof-carrying verification core for PWL neural constraints on an input domain $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. We formalize the exact PWL semantics as a union of polyhedra indexed by activation patterns, relate this model to standard exact SMT/MILP encodings and to the canonical convex-hull (ideal) relaxation of a bounded ReLU, and introduce a small certificate calculus whose proof objects live over $\mathbb{Q}$. Two certificate types suffice for the core reasoning steps: entailment certificates validate linear consequences (bound tightening and learned cuts), while Farkas certificates prove infeasibility of strengthened counterexample queries (branch-and-bound pruning). We give an exact proof kernel that checks these artifacts in rational arithmetic, prove soundness and completeness for linear entailment, and show that infeasibility certificates admit sparse representatives depending only on dimension. Worked examples illustrate end-to-end certified reasoning without trusting the solver beyond its exported witnesses.</description>
