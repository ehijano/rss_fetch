      <title>$(\mathfrak{gl}_{n},\mathfrak{gl}_{m})$-duality and Olshanski homomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the images of the Bethe subalgebras of the Yangians $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_{n})$ and $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_{m})$ under the homomorphisms to $U(\mathfrak{gl}_{n+m})$ given by the Olshanski centralizer construction coincide. We use this result to obtain the $(\mathfrak{gl}_{n},\mathfrak{gl}_{m})$-duality of the trigonometric Gaudin model and the XXX-spin chain. The duality is obtained in an explicit way relating the generating differential operator on one side and the generating difference operator on the other, thus agreeing with the result of Mukhin, Tarasov and Varchenko arXiv:math/0605172.</description>

      <title>4-dimensional Skein modules, Handle attachments, and Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skein lasagna modules are a recent tool developed for the study of 4-manifolds. We provide general formula for 1-, 2-, and 3-handle attachments for skein modules defined with any functorial link theory in $S^3 \times I$ generalizing existing formula of Chen, Manolescu-Neithalath, Manolescu-Walker-Wedrich, and Ren-Willis. These formula are derived from a complete description of the gluing homomorphism on skein modules. For this description, we introduce a variation of these skein modules in the presence of distinguished 3-manifolds in the boundary. A similar construction was recently introduced independently by Blackwell-Krushkal-Luo.</description>

      <title>Degenerations of CoHAs of 2-Calabi-Yau categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By work of Davison and Meinhardt, the cohomological Hall algebra of a symmetric quiver with potential admits a geometrically defined filtration (the perverse filtration) whose associated graded is a supercommutative algebra. In the case of the triple quiver of a quiver with the canonical cubic potential, which corresponds to the preprojective algebra of the quiver via dimensional reduction, there is an additional filtration (the less perverse filtration), which is defined more generally for cohomological Hall algebras of suitably geometric 2-Calabi-Yau categories in work of Davison. In this paper, we show that the degenerations of the cohomological Hall algebras of preprojective algebras and more generally 2-Calabi-Yau categories with respect to the less perverse filtration is isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of the current Lie algebra of the BPS Lie algebra. This result applies in particular to CoHAs of local systems on Riemann surfaces and Higgs bundles on smooth projective curves. We extend this description to deformations of the cohomological Hall algebra obtained via torus actions on the arrows of the quiver and deformed canonical cubic potentials via the deformed dimensional reduction of Davison-P\u{a}durariu. Last, we use our results to compare the less perverse filtration on CoHAs of preprojective algebras with the order filtration on the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, via the comparison isomorphism of Botta-Davison and Schiffmann-Vasserot.</description>

      <title>Stuck Knots: Rigidity, Invariants, and Unsticking Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A {\it stuck knot} is a knot diagram containing designated crossings, called {\it stuck crossings}, whose incident strands are required to remain locally non-separable. These rigidity constraints restrict the allowable ambient isotopies and introduce new geometric features into the study of knot embeddings. In this paper we develop a topological framework for knots governed by such constraints. We model stuck crossings as locally rigid configurations in spatial embeddings, placing stuck knots in close relation to rigid spatial graph theory while preserving the classical over-under information and orientation of crossings. We formalize the corresponding notion of isotopy and introduce the {\it unstick move}, which releases rigidity and allows classical simplifications to occur. To detect rigid structure algebraically, we construct polynomial invariants for stuck knots, including a HOMFLYPT-type invariant and a state-sum model extending the Kauffman bracket. These invariants show that rigidity contributes independent information even when the underlying classical knot type remains fixed. We further introduce a {\it relaxed isotopy} framework and define the {\it unsticking distance}, a geometric measure quantifying the minimal number of rigidity constraints that must be released in order to relate two stuck knots. This perspective interprets stuck crossings as barriers to isotopy and highlights the role of constraint release in diagrammatic simplification.</description>

      <title>Twisted symmetric exclusion processes and set-theoretical $R$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate periodic integrable Markov models, constructed from set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We first focus on the simplest class of solutions, called Lyubashenko solutions. We show that the resulting models are equivalent to some twisted Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP), which are usual periodic SSEP models where a twist is added on a bond of the ring. We also provide various possible interpretations for these Markov models. Then, we study the long time dynamics of the twisted SSEP, characterising its different stationary states and counting them. Allowing the twist to vary, we examine the possible transitions between the different stationary states. Finally, we extend our construction of Markov models to set-theoretical solutions that are more general than Lyubashenko solutions and show that such models are not equivalent to a twisted SSEP in general.</description>

      <title>Quantum relations in the general setting: composition and adjacency operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum relations in the sense of Weaver are $M'$-bimodules, for a von Neumann algebra $M$, these generalising actual relations on a set $X$ when $M=\ell^\infty(X)$. Similarly, relations between two sets can be generalised as bimodules over the commutants of two algebras. We make an explicit study of this idea, developing some tools to check that constructions are well-defined. Motivation comes from Kornell's concept of a Quantum Set (for algebras which are sums of matrix algebras), and we find that $*$-homomorphisms correspond to certain quantum relations, extending unpublished work of Kornell. We find a functor from completely positive maps to quantum relations, related to the idea of taking a noisy communication channel and reducing it to its underlying ``relation''. As with Quantum Graphs, at least in finite-dimensions, quantum relations correspond to ``adjacency operators'', certain CP maps depending on a choices of faithful functional on the algebras. We develop some tools to deal with the non-Schur-idempotent case, and show links with our functor from CP maps, and work of Verdon. We explicitly compute the adjacency operator of a $*$-homomorphism.</description>

      <title>The kernel of formal polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polylogarithmic functions (polylogs) in $n$ variables can be viewed as elements of $(U\mathfrak{p}_{m})^*$, the dual of the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{p}_{m}$ of infinitesimal spherical pure braids with $m=n+3$ strands. Polylogs with $m=4,5$ are used in the theory relating double shuffle relations and Drinfeld associators \cite{furusho_double_2011}. We give explicit formulas for elements of $(U\mathfrak{p}_{m})^*$ representing polylogs, and compute the left ideal $J_{m} \subset U\mathfrak{p}_{m}$ given by their joint kernel. We introduce Lie subalgebras $\mathfrak{k}_{m}=\mathfrak{p}_{m} \cap J_{m}$, and we compute them for $m=4, 5$.</description>
