      <title>Complex-time singular structure of the 1D Hou-Luo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from smooth initial data, we investigate the complex-time analytic structure of the one-dimensional Hou--Luo (HL) model, a wall approximation of the three-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations. While the finite-time blow-up in this setting has been already established, here we chart the entire singular landscape. This analysis is enabled by a novel formulation of the HL model in Lagrangian coordinates, in which the time-Taylor coefficients of the flow fields are evaluated symbolically to high truncation order. Our results are threefold. First, we show that the Lagrangian series for the vorticity converges within the complex-time disc of radius~$t_\star &gt;0$ and is free from (early-time) resonances that impede the Eulerian formulation. Second, applying asymptotic analysis on the series, we recover both the blow-up time and the singularity exponent with high accuracy. This also enables a quantitative assessment of the Beale--Kato--Majda criterion, which we find correctly identifies the blow-up time, but washes out the local singularity exponent, as it relies on a spatial supremum. Third, and most importantly, we develop a Lagrangian singularity theory that predicts the eye-shaped singularity profile observed in Eulerian coordinates by exploiting the driving mechanism of the blow-up: The accumulation of multiple fluid particles at the same Eulerian position. The employed techniques extend recently introduced methods for the inviscid Burgers equation [C. Rampf et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 7 (2022) 10, 104610], and can be further adapted to higher spatial dimensions or other hydrodynamical equations.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition to active nematic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded and defect-free active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.</description>
