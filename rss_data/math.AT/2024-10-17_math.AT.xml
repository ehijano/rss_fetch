      <title>Pathological Computations of Mackey Functor-valued Tor over Cyclic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute Mackey functor-valued Tor over certain free incomplete Tambara functors, generalizing the computation of Tor over a polynomial ring on one generator. In contrast with the classical situation where the resulting Tor groups vanish above degree one, we present examples where Tor is nonvanishing in almost every degree. We also discuss a 2-primary analogue of the odd-primary Koszul complexes defined in our other work \cite{MQS24a}.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Weiss Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an equivariant analog of Weiss calculus of functors for all finite group $\mathrm{G}$. In our theory, Taylor approximations and derivatives are index by finite dimensional $\mathrm{G}$-representations, and homogeneous layers are classified by orthogonal $\mathrm{G}$-spectra. Further, our framework permits a notion of restriction as well as a notion of fixed-point at the level of Weiss functors. We establish various results comparing Taylor approximations and derivatives of fixed-point (resp. restrictions) functors to that of the fixed-point (resp. restrictions) of Taylor approximations and derivatives.</description>

      <title>Deformation Quantization via Categorical Factorization Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an approach to categorical deformation quantization via factorization homology. We show that a quantization of the local coefficients for factorization homology is equivalent to consistent quantizations of its value on manifolds. To formulate our results we introduce the concepts of shifted almost Poisson and BD categories. Our main example is the character stack of flat principal bundles for a reductive algebraic group $G$, where we show that applying the general framework to the Drinfeld category reproduces deformations previously introduced by Li-Bland and \v{S}evera. As a direct consequence, we can conclude a precise relation between their quantization and those introduced by Alekseev, Grosse, and Schomerus. To arrive at our results we compute factorization homology with values in a ribbon category enriched over complete $\mathbb{C}[[\hbar]]$-modules. More generally, we define enriched skein categories which compute factorization homology for ribbon categories enriched over a general closed symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{V}$.</description>

      <title>A Hodge Theory for Entanglement Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>Computing the Dimension of a Bipartition Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05799v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dimension of a bipartition matrix (BPM) is the sum of the dimensions of its indecomposable factors. The dimension of an indecomposable BPM is the sum of its row, column, and entry dimensions. To compute these dimensions, we apply four routines of independent interest: (1) Factor a bipartition as a product of indecomposables; (2) recover a bipartition from its indecomposable factorization; (3) factor a BPM as a product of indecomposables; and (4) compute the ``transpose-rotation'' (the column dimension of a BPM is the row dimension of its transpose-rotation).</description>

      <title>Topology of matching complexes of complete graphs via discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02973v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bouc (1992) first studied the topological properties of $M_n$, the matching complex of the complete graph of order $n$, in connection with Brown complexes and Quillen complexes. Bj\"{o}rner et al. (1994) showed that $M_n$ is homotopically $(\nu_n-1)$-connected, where $\nu_n=\lfloor{\frac{n+1}{3}}\rfloor-1$, and conjectured that this connectivity bound is sharp. Shareshian and Wachs (2007) settled the conjecture by inductively showing that the $\nu_n$-dimensional homology group of $M_n$ is nontrivial, with Bouc's calculation of $H_1(M_7)$ serving as the pivotal base step. In general, the topology of $M_n$ is not very well-understood, even for a small $n$. In the present article, we look into the topology of $M_n$, and $M_7$ in particular, in the light of discrete Morse theory as developed by Forman (1998). We first construct a gradient vector field on $M_n$ (for $n \ge 5$) that doesn't admit any critical simplices of dimension up to $\nu_n-1$, except one unavoidable $0$-simplex, which also leads to the aforementioned $(\nu_n-1)$-connectedness of $M_n$ in a purely combinatorial way. However, for an efficient homology computation by discrete Morse theoretic techniques, we are required to work with a gradient vector field that admits a low number of critical simplices, and also allows an efficient enumeration of gradient paths. An optimal gradient vector field is one with the least number of critical simplices, but the problem of finding an optimal gradient vector field, in general, is an NP-hard problem (even for $2$-dimensional complexes). We improve the gradient vector field constructed on $M_7$ in particular to a much more efficient (near-optimal) one, and then with the help of this improved gradient vector field, compute the homology groups of $M_7$ in an efficient and algorithmic manner. We also augment this near-optimal gradient vector field to one that we conjecture to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Topological reconstruction of sampled surfaces via Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the perception problem for sampled surfaces (possibly with boundary) using tools from computational topology, specifically, how to identify their underlying topology starting from point-cloud samples in space, such as those obtained with 3D scanners. We present a reconstruction algorithm based on a careful topological study of the point sample that allows us to obtain a cellular decomposition of it using a Morse function. No triangulation or local implicit equations are used as intermediate steps, avoiding in this way reconstruction-induced artifices. The algorithm can be run without any prior knowledge of the surface topology, density or regularity of the point-sample. The results consist of a piece-wise decomposition of the given surface as a union of Morse cells (i.e. topological disks), suitable for tasks such as mesh-independent reparametrization or noise-filtering, and a small-rank cellular complex determining the topology of the surface. The algorithm, which we test with several real and synthetic surfaces, can be applied to smooth surfaces with or without boundary, embedded in an ambient space of any dimension.</description>
