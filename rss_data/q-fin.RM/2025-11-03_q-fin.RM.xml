      <title>Black-Scholes Model, comparison between Analytical Solution and Numerical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to give a general overview and understanding of the first widely used option-pricing model, the Black-Scholes model. The history and context are presented, with the usefulness and implications in the economics world. A brief review of fundamental calculus concepts is introduced to derive and solve the model. The equation is then resolved using both an analytical (variable separation) and a numerical method (finite differences). Conclusions are drawn in order to understand how Black-Scholes is employed nowadays. At the end a handy appendix (A) is written with some economics notions to ease the reader's comprehension of the paper; furthermore a second appendix (B) is given with some code scripts, to allow the reader to put in practice some concepts.</description>

      <title>Risk-constrained stochastic scheduling of multi-market energy storage systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy storage can promote the integration of renewables by operating with charge and discharge policies that balance an intermittent power supply. This study investigates the scheduling of energy storage assets under energy price uncertainty, with a focus on electricity markets. A two-stage stochastic risk-constrained approach is employed, whereby electricity price trajectories or specific power markets are observed, allowing for recourse in the schedule. Conditional value-at-risk is used to quantify tail risk in the optimization problems; this allows for the explicit specification of a probabilistic risk limit. The proposed approach is tested in an integrated hydrogen system (IHS) and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In the joint design and operation context for the IHS, the risk constraint results in larger installed unit capacities, increasing capital cost but enabling more energy inventory to buffer price uncertainty. As shown in both case studies, there is an operational trade-off between risk and expected reward; this is reflected in higher expected costs (or lower expected profits) with increasing levels of risk aversion. Despite the decrease in expected reward, both systems exhibit substantial benefits of increasing risk aversion. This work provides a general method to address uncertainties in energy storage scheduling, allowing operators to input their level of risk tolerance on asset decisions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quoting under Adverse Selection and Price Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, many dealers have implemented algorithmic models to automatically respond to RFQs and manage flows originating from their electronic platforms. In parallel, building on the foundational work of Ho and Stoll, and later Avellaneda and Stoikov, the academic literature on market making has expanded to address trade size distributions, client tiering, complex price dynamics, alpha signals, and the internalization versus externalization dilemma in markets with dealer-to-client and interdealer-broker segments. In this paper, we tackle two critical dimensions: adverse selection, arising from the presence of informed traders, and price reading, whereby the market maker's own quotes inadvertently reveal the direction of their inventory. These risks are well known to practitioners, who routinely face informed flows and algorithms capable of extracting signals from quoting behavior. Yet they have received limited attention in the quantitative finance literature, beyond stylized toy models with limited actionability. Extending the existing literature, we propose a tractable and implementable framework that enables market makers to adjust their quotes with greater awareness of informational risk.</description>
