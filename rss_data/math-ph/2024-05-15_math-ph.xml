      <title>On absolutely continuous spectrum for one-channel unitary operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the radial transfer matrix formalism for unitary one-channel operators. This generalizes previous formalisms for CMV matrices and scattering zippers. We establish an analog of Carmona's formula and deduce criteria for absolutely continuous spectrum which we apply to random Hilbert Schmidt perturbations of periodic scattering zippers.</description>

      <title>Construction of special Lagrangian submanifolds of the Taub-NUT manifold and the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct special Lagrangian submanifolds of the Taub-NUT manifold and the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold by combining the generalized Legendre transform approach and the moment map technique. The generalized Legendre transform approach provides a formulation to construct hyperk\"ahler manifolds and can make their Calabi-Yau structures manifest. In this approach, the K\"ahler $2$-forms and the holomorphic volume forms can be written in terms of holomorphic coordinates, which are convenient to employ the moment map technique. This technique derives the condition that a submanifold in the Calabi-Yau manifold is special Lagrangian. For the Taub-NUT manifold and the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold, by the moment map technique, special Lagrangian submanifolds are obtained as a one-parameter family of the orbits corresponding to Hamiltonian action with respect to their K\"ahler 2-forms. The resultant special Lagrangian submanifolds have cohomogeneity-one symmetry. To demonstrate that our method is useful, we recover the conditions for the special Lagrangian submanifold of the Taub-NUT manifold which is invariant under the tri-holomorphic $U(1)$ symmetry. As new applications of our method, we construct special Lagrangian submanifolds of the Taub-NUT manifold and the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold which are invariant under the action of a Lie subgroup of $SO(3)$. In these constructions, our conditions for being special Lagrangian are expressed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to the one-parameters. We numerically give solution curves for the ODEs which specify the special Lagrangian submanifolds for the above cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalized spectral zeta function of the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian is considered. It is shown that the renormalized spectral zeta function converges to the Riemann zeta function as the coupling constant goes to infinity. Moreover the path measure associated with the ground state of the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian
  is constructed on a discontinuous path space, and several applications are shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chynoweth and Sewell proposed a mathematical model for an atmospheric front based on the singularities of the Legendre transformation between different pairs of dual variables. Drawing inspiration from their work, we formalize the idea of a Chynoweth-Sewell front and illuminate its geometrical meaning from the viewpoint of Monge-Ampere geometry. This extends our previous work on the semigeostrophic model to dynamically-forming singularities. We use the notion of a Chynoweth-Sewell front to characterize the classical Eady problem and its known solutions in geometrical terms.</description>

      <title>Clustering of higher order connected correlations in C$^*$ dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of $C^*$ dynamical systems, we consider a locally compact group $G$ acting by $^*$-automorphisms on a C$^*$ algebra $\mathfrak{U}$ of observables, and assume a state of $\mathfrak{U}$ that satisfies the clustering property with respect to a net of group elements of $G$. That is, the two-point connected correlation function vanishes in the limit on the net, when one observable is translated under the group action. Then we show that all higher order connected correlation functions (Ursell functions, or classical cumulants) and all free correlation functions (free cumulants, from free probability) vanish at the same rate in that limit. Additionally, we show that mean clustering, also called ergodicity, extends to higher order correlations. We then apply those results to equilibrium states of quantum spin lattice models. Under certain assumptions on the range of the interaction, high temperature Gibbs states are known to be exponentially clustering w.r.t. space translations. Combined with the Lieb-Robinson bound, one obtains exponential clustering for space-time translations outside the Lieb-Robinson light-cone. Therefore, by our present results, all the higher order connected and free correlation functions will vanish exponentially under space-time translations outside the Lieb-Robinson light cone, in high temperature Gibbs states. Another consequence is that their long-time averaging over a space-time ray vanishes for almost every ray velocity.</description>

      <title>Is every triangle a trajectory of an elliptical billiard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Marden's Theorem from geometric theory of polynomials, we show that for every triangle there is a unique ellipse such that the triangle is a billiard trajectory within that ellipse. Since $3$-periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses are examples of the Poncelet polygons, our considerations provide a new insight into the relationship between Marden's Theorem and the Poncelet Porism, two gems of exceptional classical beauty. We also show that every parallelogram is a billiard trajectory within a unique ellipse. We prove a similar result for the self-intersecting polygonal lines consisting of two pairs of congruent sides, named ``Darboux butterflies". In each of three considered cases, we effectively calculate the foci of the boundary ellipses.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent discussions concerning the definition of a quantum field theory in a curved and noncommutative space, the Snyder--de Sitter space. For a quartic self-interacting scalar field in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension, we show how to perturbatively define the classical action in the small-deformation regime and give its explicit first-order expression. Afterwards, we compute the divergences of the one-loop effective action for the two- and four-dimensional cases. These are employed to calculate the beta functions of the couplings and to numerically analyze the corresponding renormalization group flow. Depending on the initial conditions of the couplings, in four dimensions it is possible to obtain an asymptotic-free theory or a flip in the sign of the cosmological constant as a consequence of the running.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Ginzburg--Landau model in a planar simply connected domain, with a local compactly supported applied magnetic field, we derive an effective model in the strong field limit, defined on a non-simply connected domain. The effective model features oscillations in the Little-Parks and Aharonov--Bohm spirit. We discuss also a similar question for the lowest eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>On the effect of derivative interactions in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist several good reasons why one may wish to add a total derivative to an interaction in quantum field theory, e.g., in order to improve the perturbative construction. Unlike in classical field theory, adding derivatives in general changes the theory. The analysis whether and how this can be prevented, is presently limited to perturbative orders $g^n$ , $n \leq 3$. We drastically simplify it by an all-orders formula, which also allows to answer some salient structural questions. The method is part of a larger program to (re)derive interactions of particles by quantum consistency conditions, rather than a classical principle of gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>Particle transport based study of nucleation in a ferromagnetic three-state spin system with conservative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pose the problem of metastability for a three--state spin system with conservative dynamics. We consider the Blume--Capel model with the Kawasaki dynamics, we prove that, in a particular region of the parameter plane, the metastable state is the unique homogeneous minus state, and we estimate the exit time. To achieve our goal we have to solve several variational problems in the configuration space which result to be particularly involved, due to complicated structure of the trajectories. They key ingredient is the control of the energy differences between the configurations crossed when a spin is transported from the boundary to an internal site of the lattice through a completely arbitrary mixture of the three--state spin species. To master these mechanisms we have introduced a new approach based on the transport of spins along nearest neighbor connected regions of the lattice with constant spin configuration. This novel approach goes beyond the Blume--Capel model and can be used for the study of more general multi--state spin models.</description>

      <title>Static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions in teleparallel F(T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate static spherically symmetric teleparallel F(T) gravity containing a perfect isotropic fluid. We first write the field equations and proceed to find new teleparallel F(T) solutions for perfect isotropic and linear fluids. By using a power-law ansatz for the coframe components, we find several classes of new non-trivial teleparallel F(T) solutions. We also find a new class of teleparallel F(T) solutions for a matter dust fluid. After we solve the field equations for a non-linear perfect fluid. Once again, there are several new exact teleparallel F(T) solutions and also some approximated teleparallel F(T) solutions. All these classes of new solutions may be relevant for future cosmological and astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of the two-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process with attachment and detachment of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a paradigmatic driven-diffusive system that describes the asymmetric diffusion of particles with hardcore interactions in a lattice. Although the ASEP is known as an exactly solvable model, most exact results are limited to one-dimensional systems. Recently, the exact steady state in the multi-dimensional ASEP has been proposed [1]. The research focused on the situation where the number of particles is conserved. In this paper, we consider the two-dimensional ASEP with the attachment and detachment of particles (ASEP-LK), where particle number conservation is violated. By employing the result in Ref. [1], we construct the exact steady state of the ASEP-LK and reveal its properties through the exact computation of physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

Abstract: We determine explicit expressions for the continuous two-sided gravitational wavefunctions in supersymmetric versions of JT gravity, focusing mainly on $\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity. Our approach is based on representation theory of the associated supergroup, for which we determine the relevant mixed parabolic matrix elements that implement asymptotic AdS boundary conditions at the quantum level. We match our expressions with those found by solving the energy-eigenvalue equation of arXiv:2207.00408. We discuss gravitational applications by computing several amplitudes of interest, and address how our framework can be generalized further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a series representation for the Virasoro fusion and modular kernels at any irrational central charge. Two distinct, yet closely related formulas are needed for the cases $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ and $c &lt;1$. We also conjecture that the formulas have a well-defined limit as the central charge approaches rational values. Our proposal for $c &lt;1$ agrees numerically with the fusion transformation of the four-point spherical conformal blocks, whereas our proposal for $c\in \mathbb C \backslash (-\infty,1]$ agrees numerically with Ponsot and Teschner's integral formula for the fusion kernel. The case of the modular kernel is studied as a special case of the fusion kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a semi-classical approximation to the dynamics of a point particle in a noncommutative space. In this approximation, the noncommutativity of space coordinates is described by a Poisson bracket. For linear Poisson brackets, the corresponding phase space is given by the cotangent bundle of a Lie group, with the Lie group playing the role of a curved momentum space. We show that the curvature of the momentum space may lead to rather unexpected physical phenomena such as an upper bound on the velocity of a free nonrelativistic particle, bounded motion for repulsive central force, and no-fall-into-the-centre for attractive Coulomb potential. We also present a superintegrable Hamiltonian for the Kepler problem in $3$-space with ${su}(2)$ noncommutativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insufficient reference data is ubiquitous in data-driven computational fluid dynamics, as it is usually too expensive to compute or impossible to observe over long enough times needed for data-driven methods to properly operate out of the sampled range. Ultimately, the lack of data can significantly compromise the fidelity of results computed with data-driven methods or make the data-driven approach inapplicable. In order to challenge this problem, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction method which enriches the hyper-parameterisation approach with ideas underlying the probabilistic-evolutionary approach. We offer to use Advection of the image point (a hyper-parameterisation method) on data sampled from the joint probability distribution of the reference dataset. The idea is to blend together the simplicity of the hyper-parameterisation (HP) method with an extra source of reference data provided through sampling from the joint probability distribution.
  The HP method has been tested on the sea surface temperature and surface relative vorticity computed with the global 1/4-degree and 1/12-degree resolution NEMO model. Our results show that the HP solution (the solution computed with the HP method) in the probabilistically-reconstructed and reduced (in terms of dimensionality) phase space at 1/4-degree resolution is more accurate compared to the 1/4-degree solution computed with NEMO and it is also several orders of magnitude faster to compute than the 1/4-degree run. The proposed method shows encouraging results for the NEMO model and the potential for the use in other operational ocean and ocean-atmospheric models for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin Interactions in General Relativity versus Linearized Massive Gravity: $N$-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulated spin-spin interactions of $N$-bodies in linearized General Relativity (GR) and linearized Massive Gravity of the Fierz-Pauli type (mGR). It was noted earlier that there is a discrete difference between the spin-spin interaction potential in GR and mGR for a $2$-body system, akin to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in the static Newton's potential. Specifically, at large distances, GR favors anti-parallel spin orientation with total spin pointing along the interaction axis, while mGR favors parallel spin orientation with total spin perpendicular to the axis between the sources. For an $N$-body system, a simulation in mGR hitherto has not been done and one would like to know the total spin of the system in both theories. Here we remedy this. In the simulations of GR, we observed that the total spin tends to decrease from a random initial configuration, while for mGR with a large distance, the total spin increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New one parameter family of exact solutions in General Relativity with a scalar field is found. The metric is of Liouville type which admits complete separation of variables in the geodesic Hamilton--Jacobi equation. This solution exists for the exponential potential for a scalar field and is invariant with respect to global Lorentz transformations. It describes, in particular, a black hole formation as well as a naked singularity. Solutions corresponding to the naked singularity describe accelerating expansion of the homogeneous and isotropic Universe, and can be smoothly continued along geodesics to infinite past without Big Bang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the idea of using Kuramoto models (including their higher-dimensional generalizations) for machine learning over non-Euclidean data sets. These models are systems of matrix ODE's describing collective motions (swarming dynamics) of abstract particles (generalized oscillators) on spheres, homogeneous spaces and Lie groups. Such models have been extensively studied from the beginning of XXI century both in statistical physics and control theory. They provide a suitable framework for encoding maps between various manifolds and are capable of learning over spherical and hyperbolic geometries. In addition, they can learn coupled actions of transformation groups (such as special orthogonal, unitary and Lorentz groups). Furthermore, we overview families of probability distributions that provide appropriate statistical models for probabilistic modeling and inference in Geometric Deep Learning. We argue in favor of using statistical models which arise in different Kuramoto models in the continuum limit of particles. The most convenient families of probability distributions are those which are invariant with respect to actions of certain symmetry groups.</description>

      <title>The OU$^2$ process: Characterising dissipative confinement in noisy traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process describes the dynamics of Brownian particles in a confining harmonic potential, thereby constituting the paradigmatic model of overdamped, mean-reverting Langevin dynamics. Despite its widespread applicability, this model falls short when describing physical systems where the confining potential is itself subjected to stochastic fluctuations. However, such stochastic fluctuations generically emerge in numerous situations, including in the context of colloidal manipulation by optical tweezers, leading to inherently out-of-equilibrium trapped dynamics. To explore the consequences of stochasticity at this level, we introduce a natural extension of the OU process, in which the stiffness of the harmonic potential is itself subjected to OU-like fluctuations. We call this model the OU$^2$ process. We examine its statistical, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties through a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Importantly, we show that the probability density for the particle position presents power-law tails, in contrast to the Gaussian decay of the standard OU process. In turn, this causes the trapping behavior, extreme value statistics, first passage statistics, and entropy production of the OU$^2$ process to differ qualitatively from their standard OU counterpart. Due to the wide applicability of the standard OU process and of the proposed OU$^2$ generalisation, our study sheds light on the peculiar properties of stochastic dynamics in random potentials and lays the foundation for the refined analysis of the dynamics and thermodynamics of numerous experimental systems.</description>

      <title>A geometric formulation to measure global and genuine entanglement in three-qubit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a purely geometric formulation for two different measures addressed to quantify the entanglement between different parts of a tripartite qubit system. Our approach considers the entanglement-polytope defined by the smallest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of the qubit-components. The measures identify global and genuine entanglement, and are respectively associated with the projection and rejection of a given point of the polytope on the corresponding biseparable segments. Solving the so called `inverse problem', we also discuss a way to force the system to behave in a particular form, which opens the possibility of controlling and manipulating entanglement for practical purposes.</description>

Abstract: The quantum dynamics of charged scalar bosons in a Bonnor-Melvin-$\Lambda$ universe is considered. In this study, the behavior of charged scalar bosons is explored within the framework of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) formalism. Adopting a conical approximation ($\Lambda\ll 1$), we are considered two scenarios for the vector potential: a linear and quadratic vector potentials. In particular, the effects of this background in the equation of motion, phase shift, $S$-matrix, energy spectrum and DKP spinor are analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Some 1d (Supersymmetric) Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dimensional reduction by spherical symmetry in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories with gauge groups $SU(2)$ and $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ (de Sitter gravity). We start with pure Chern-Simons theories and show that the reduced theory obtained by employing a spherically symmetric ansatz on the gauge field is similar to a fermionic theory in 1d coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field with a 1-dimensional Chern-Simons kinetic term. Furthermore, we carry out a semiclassical computation that demonstrates that in the large $\kappa$ limit, the path integral of the 3d pure Chern-Simons theory is equivalent to the path integral of the dimensionally reduced theory, which is a 1d QFT. Moreover, we argue that the Wilson loop operators in the large $\kappa$ limit should reduce to some observables of the 1-dimensional theory. This agreement hints at the existence of a duality at the quantum level between the 3d Chern-Simons theory and the 1d reduced theory. We then study Chern-Simons Higgs theories in the Euclidean formalism. We again employ the spherically symmetric ansatz\"e on the fields, and show that at the clasical level, the action of the reduced theory is a theory with some scalar fields $\mathsf{X}_i$ coupled to fermionic fields $\Psi_i$. To get an appropriate reduced action, we define the original theory on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ with the geometry of $\mathbb{R} \times S^2$. With a suitable choice of the potential of the Higgs field, we show that the reduced theory, which is the action that governs the spherically symmetric monopoles in the Chern-Simons Higgs theory, is equivalent to a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. The flux of the Chern-Simons Higgs monopole is shown to be related to the fermionic number operator $F = \overline{\Psi} \Psi$, which in turn is related to the Witten index.</description>

      <title>Interior solution of azimuthally symmetric case of Laplace equation in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curvilinear coordinate systems distinct from the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system are particularly valuable in the field calculations as they facilitate the expression of boundary conditions of differential equations in a reasonably simple way when the coordinate surfaces fit the physical boundaries of the problem. The recently finalized orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. Such shape is aproximating well objects investigated within astrophysics. The solution of the azimuthally symmetric case of the Laplace equation was found for the interior space in the orthogonal SOS coordinates. In the frame of the derivation of the harmonic functions, the Laplace equation was separated by a special separation procedure. A generalized Legendre equation was introduced as the equation for the angular part of the separated Laplace equation. The harmonic functions were determined as relations involving generalized Legendre functions of the first and of the second kind. Several lower-degree functions are reported. Recursion formula facilitating determination of the higher-degree harmonic functions was found. The general solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation for the interior space in the SOS coordinates is reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study some algebraic aspects of multicomplex numbers $\mathbb M_n$. For $n\geq 2$ a canonical representation is defined in terms of the multiplication of $n-1$ idempotent elements. This representation facilitates computations in this algebra and makes it possible to introduce a generalized conjugacy $\Lambda_n$, i.e. a composition of the $n$ multicomplex conjugates $\Lambda_n:=\dagger_1\cdots \dagger_n$, as well as a multicomplex norm. The multicomplex algebra equipped with this norm and $\Lambda_n$ as the involution forms a C$^*$-algebra. The ideals of the ring of multicomplex numbers are then studied in details. Free $\mathbb M_n$-modules and their linear operators are considered. Finally, we develop Hilbert spaces on the multicomplex algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.05477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative blow-up criteria below the scaling threshold for radially symmetric solutions to the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinearity $|u|^6u$. This provides to our knowledge the first generic results distinguishing potential blow-up solutions of the defocusing equation from many of the known examples of blow-up in the focusing case. Our main tool is a quantitative version of a result showing that uniform bounds on $L^2$-based critical Sobolev norms imply scattering estimates.
  As another application of our techniques, we establish a variant which allows for slow growth in the critical norm. We show that if the critical Sobolev norm on compact time intervals is controlled by a slowly growing quantity depending on the Stricharz norm, then the solution can be extended globally in time, with a corresponding scattering estimate.</description>

Abstract: We consider the quantum cat map - a toy model of a quantized chaotic system. We show that its eigenstates are fully delocalized on $\mathbb{T}^2$ in the semiclassical limit (or equivalently that each semiclassical measure is fully supported on $\mathbb{T}^2$). We adapt the proof of a similar result proved for the eigenstates of $-\Delta_g$ on compact hyperbolic surfaces from [arXiv:1705.05019], relying on the fractal uncertainty principle in [arXiv:1612.09040].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of mild solutions to the Boussinesq systems on the framework of non-compact Riemannian manifolds. We work on some manifolds satisfying some bounded and negative conditions on curvature tensors. We consider a couple of Stokes and heat semigroups associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. By using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup we establish the existence and uniqueness of the bounded-in-time mild solution for linear system. Next, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to obtain the well-posedness by utilizing fixed point arguments. Moreover, we will prove the exponential stability of such solutions by using Gronwall's inequality. Finally, we give an application of stability to study periodic mild solutions. Our results extend the ones in \cite{Pi,HuyHa2022} in the aspect of global-in-time well-posedness and the existence of periodic mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Global exterior stability of the Minkowski space: coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03167v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we prove a global gauge-invariant radiation estimates for the perturbations of the $3+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the presence of Yang-Mills sources. In particular, we obtain a novel gauge invariant estimate for the Yang-Mills fields coupled to gravity in a double null framework in the Causal complement of a compact set of a Cauchy slice. A consequence of our result is the global exterior stability of the Minkowski space under coupled Yang-Mills perturbations. A special structure present both in the null Bianchi equations and the null Yang-Mills equations is utilized crucially to obtain the dispersive estimates necessary to conclude the global existence property. Direct use of Bel-Robinson and Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor to obtain the energy estimates is avoided in favor of weighted integration by parts taking advantage of the manifestly symmetric hyperbolic characteristics of null Bianchi and null Yang-Mills equations. Our result holds for any compact semi-simple gauge group. This is the first stability result of Minkowski space including a non-linear source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How large is the Bessel potential, $G_{\alpha,\mu}f$, compared to the Riesz potential, $I_\alpha f$, of a given function? We prove that, for certain $f$ and $p$,
  \[\Vert G_{1,\mu} f\Vert_p\approx \omega(I_1f,1/\mu)_p,\] where $\omega(f,t)_p$ is the $L^p$ modulus of continuity. However, for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, \[\Vert G_{\alpha,\mu}f\Vert_p\leq C(\omega(I_\alpha f,1/\mu)_p)^\alpha\cdot\Vert I_\alpha f\Vert^{1-\alpha}_p.\] These estimates are obtained by studying the quotient of the two operators, $E_{\alpha,\mu}:=\frac{(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}}{(\mu^2-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}}$, and exploiting its approximation theoretic properties. Additionally, $G_{\alpha,\mu}f=\mathcal{O}(\mu^{-\frac\alpha2})$ if $I_\alpha f$ vanishes near a given point. This ``localization" result is derived from kernel estimates of $E_{\alpha,\mu}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we establish the asymptotic stability of steady solutions for the Boussinesq systems in the framework of Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n \geqslant 3$. In our strategy, we first establish the continuity for the long time of the bilinear terms associated with the mild solutions of the Boussinesq systems, i.e., the bilinear estimates by using only the norm of the present spaces. As a direct consequence, we obtain the existence of global small mild solutions and asymptotic stability of steady solutions of the Boussinesq systems in the class of continuous functions from $[0, \infty)$ to the Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces. Our techniques consist interpolation of operators, duality, heat semigroup estimates , Holder and Young inequalities in block spaces (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey-Lorentz spaces. Our results are generalized the previous ones of the steady Boussinesq systems in weak-$L^p$ spaces obtained by Hishida [T. Hishida, {\it On a class of Stable Steady flow to the Exterior Convection Problem}, Journal of Differential Equations, Vol. 141, Iss. 1 (1997), pages 54-85] and Ferreira et al. [L.C.F.

      <title>Jones polynomials from matrix elements of tangles in a pseudounitary representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17227</link>

Abstract: In these notes we review the calculation of Jones polynomials using a matrix representation of the braid group and Temperley-Lieb algebra. The pseudounitary representation that we consider allows constructing ``states'' from the group/algebra matrices and compute the knot invariants as matrix elements, rather than traces. In comparison with a more standard way of computing the invariants through traces, the matrix element method is more interesting and complete from the point of view of applications. As a byproduct of the discussion we prove a general formula for pretzel knots.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action having two contributions. The first contribution is proportional to the logarithm of the volume associated to the higher-order network by the metric. In the vacuum this contribution determines the entropy of the geometry. The second contribution is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime. The Weber number based on grid size is small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement using the Basilisk free-code platform, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveal a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze drop statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$ . This non-convergence arises from the numerical sheet breakup effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$ that is always larger than $6 \Delta$. This allows convergence of the droplet frequency above a certain critical diameter $d_c$ above and close to $h_c$. A unimodal distribution is observed in the converged range.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, plays a central role in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). The generators of such symmetries have a close connection to non-abelian anyonic objects in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we revisit the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion" which corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs. This is a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and can be interpreted as a version of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography has been expected to be applicable to the systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>
