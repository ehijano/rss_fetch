      <title>Impacts of Tempo and Mode of Environmental Fluctuations on Population Growth: Slow- and Fast-Limit Approximations of Lyapunov Exponents for Periodic and Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine to what extent the tempo and mode of environmental fluctuations matter for the growth of structured populations. The models are switching, linear ordinary differential equations $x'(t)=A(\sigma(\omega t))x(t)$ where $x(t)=(x_1(t),\dots,x_d(t))$ corresponds to the population densities in the $d$ individual states, $\sigma(t)$ is a piece-wise constant function representing the fluctuations in the environmental states $1,\dots,N$, $\omega$ is the frequency of the environmental fluctuations, and $A(1),\dots,A(n)$ are Metzler matrices. $\sigma(t)$ can either be a periodic function or correspond to a continuous-time Markov chain. Under suitable conditions, there is a Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda(\omega)$ such that $\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{t}\log\sum_i x_i(t)=\Lambda(\omega)$ for all non-negative, non-zero initial conditions $x(0)$ (with probability one in the random case). For both forms of switching, we derive analytical first-order and second-order approximations of $\Lambda(\omega)$ in the limits of slow ($\omega\to 0$) and fast ($\omega\to\infty$) environmental fluctuations. When the order of switching and the average switching times are equal, we show that the first-order approximations of $\Lambda(\omega)$ are equivalent in the slow-switching limit, but not in the fast-switching limit. We illustrate our results with applications to stage-structured and spatially-structured models. When dispersal rates are symmetric, the first order approximations suggest that population growth rates increase with the frequency of switching -- consistent with earlier work on periodic switching. In the absence of dispersal symmetry, we demonstrate that $\Lambda(\omega)$ can be non-monotonic in $\omega$. In conclusion, our results show how population growth rates depend on the tempo ($\omega$) and mode (random versus deterministic) of the environmental fluctuations.</description>

      <title>What you saw is what you got? -- Correcting reported incidence data for testing intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, different types of non-pharmaceutical interventions played an important role in the efforts to control outbreaks and to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In certain countries, large-scale voluntary testing of non-symptomatic individuals was done, with the aim of identifying asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections as well as gauging the prevalence in the general population. In this work, we present a mathematical model, used to investigate the dynamics of both observed and unobserved infections as a function of the rate of voluntary testing. The model indicate that increasing the rate of testing causes the observed prevalence to increase, despite a decrease in the true prevalence. For large testing rates, the observed prevalence also decrease. The non-monotonicity of observed prevalence explains some of the discrepancies seen when comparing uncorrected case-counts between countries. An example of such discrepancy is the COVID-19 epidemics observed in Denmark and Hungary during winter 2020/2021, for which the reported case-counts were comparable but the true prevalence were very different. The model provides a quantitative measure for the ascertainment rate between observed and true incidence, allowing for test-intensity correction of incidence data. By comparing the model to the country-wide epidemic of the Omicron variant (BA.1 and BA.2) in Denmark during the winter 2021/2022, we find a good agreement between the cumulative incidence as estimated by the model and as suggested by serology-studies. While the model does not capture the full complexity of epidemic outbreaks and the effect of different interventions, it provides a simple way to correct raw case-counts for differences in voluntary testing, making comparison across international borders and testing behaviour possible.</description>

      <title>Establishing incorruptible institutions by social contract and taxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a plausible mechanism for sustaining cooperation: people cooperate with those who have a good reputation, which can be acquired by helping others. However, this mechanism requires the population to agree on who has good or bad moral standing. Consensus can be provided by a central institution that monitors and broadcasts reputations. But how might such an institution be maintained, and how can a population ensure that it is effective and incorruptible? Here we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution of reputational judgment: a compulsory contribution from each member of the population, i.e., a tax. We analyze the maximum possible tax rate that individuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which provides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary conditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment. We also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and subject to bribery, and we analyze how often an institution must be audited to prevent bribery. Our analysis has implications for the establishment of robust public institutions that provide social information to support cooperation in large populations -- and the potential negative consequences associated with wealth or income inequality.</description>

      <title>Length-minimizing LED Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a specific type of Euclidean tree called LED (Leaves of Equal Depth) tree. LED trees can be used in computational phylogeny, since they are a natural representative of the time evolution of a set of species in a feature space. This work is focused on LED trees that are length minimizers for a given set of leaves (species) and a given isomorphism type (the hierarchical structure of ancestors). The underlying minimization problem can be seen as a variant of the classical Euclidean Steiner tree problem. Even though it has a convex objective function, it is rather non-trivial, since it has a non-convex feasible set. The main contribution of this paper is that we provide a uniqueness result for this problem. Moreover, we explore some geometrical and topological properties of the feasible set and we prove several geometrical characteristics of the length minimizers that are analogical to the properties of Steiner trees. At the end, we show a simple example of an application in historical linguistics.</description>
