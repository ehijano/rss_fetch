      <title>ZERNIPAX: A Fast and Accurate Zernike Polynomial Calculator in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zernike Polynomials serve as an orthogonal basis on the unit disc, and have been proven to be effective in optics simulations, astrophysics, and more recently in plasma simulations. Unlike Bessel functions, they maintain finite values at the disc center, ensuring inherent analyticity along the axis. We developed ZERNIPAX, an open-source Python package capable of utilizing CPU/GPUs, leveraging Google's JAX package and available on https://github.com/PlasmaControl/FastZernike.git as well as PyPI. Our implementation of the recursion relation between Jacobi polynomials significantly improves computation time compared to alternative methods by use of parallel computing while still preserving accuracy for mode numbers n&gt;100.</description>

      <title>How do Practitioners Perceive Energy Consumption on Stack Overflow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy consumption of software applications has emerged as a critical issue for practitioners to contemplate in their daily development processes. Previous studies have performed user surveys with a limited number of practitioners to comprehend practitioners' viewpoints on energy consumption. In this paper, we complement prior studies by conducting an empirical analysis of a meticulously curated dataset comprising 985 Stack Overflow (SO) questions concerning energy consumption. These questions reflect real-world energy-related predicaments faced by practitioners in their daily development activities. To understand practitioners' perception of energy consumption, we investigate the intentions behind these questions, their semantic topics, as well as the tag categories associated with these questions. Our empirical study results reveal that (i) the intentions that drive the questioners to initiate posts and ask questions are primarily associated with understanding a concept or how to use an API; (ii) the most prevalent topic related to energy consumption concerns computing resources; (iii) monitoring energy usage poses a challenging issue, and it takes the longest response time to receive a community response to the questions; and (iv) practitioners are apprehensive about energy consumption from different levels, i.e., hardware, operating systems, and programming languages, during the development of the applications. Our work furnishes insights into the issues related to energy consumption faced by practitioners. Our observations raise awareness among practitioners about the impact of energy consumption on developing software systems from different perspectives, such as coding efficiency and energy monitoring, and shed light on future research opportunities to assist practitioners in developing energy-efficient software systems.</description>
