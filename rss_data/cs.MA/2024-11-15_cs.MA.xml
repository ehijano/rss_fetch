      <title>Theory of Mind Enhances Collective Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective Intelligence plays a central role in a large variety of fields, from economics and evolutionary theory to neural networks and eusocial insects, and it is also core to much of the work on emergence and self-organisation in complex systems theory. However, in human collective intelligence there is still much more to be understood in the relationship between specific psychological processes at the individual level and the emergence of self-organised structures at the social level. Previously psychological factors have played a relatively minor role in the study of collective intelligence as the principles are often quite general and applicable to humans just as readily as insects or other agents without sophisticated psychologies. In this article we emphasise, with examples from other complex adaptive systems, the broad applicability of collective intelligence principles while the mechanisms and time-scales differ significantly between examples. We contend that flexible collective intelligence in human social settings is improved by our use of a specific cognitive tool: our Theory of Mind. We identify several key characteristics of psychologically mediated collective intelligence and show that the development of a Theory of Mind is a crucial factor distinguishing social collective intelligence from general collective intelligence. We then place these capabilities in the context of the next steps in artificial intelligence embedded in a future that includes an effective human-AI hybrid social ecology.</description>

      <title>Artificial Theory of Mind and Self-Guided Social Organisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the challenges artificial intelligence (AI) faces is how a collection of agents coordinate their behaviour to achieve goals that are not reachable by any single agent. In a recent article by Ozmen et al this was framed as one of six grand challenges: That AI needs to respect human cognitive processes at the human-AI interaction frontier. We suggest that this extends to the AI-AI frontier and that it should also reflect human psychology, as it is the only successful framework we have from which to build out. In this extended abstract we first make the case for collective intelligence in a general setting, drawing on recent work from single neuron complexity in neural networks and ant network adaptability in ant colonies. From there we introduce how species relate to one another in an ecological network via niche selection, niche choice, and niche conformity with the aim of forming an analogy with human social network development as new agents join together and coordinate. From there we show how our social structures are influenced by our neuro-physiology, our psychology, and our language. This emphasises how individual people within a social network influence the structure and performance of that network in complex tasks, and that cognitive faculties such as Theory of Mind play a central role. We finish by discussing the current state of the art in AI and where there is potential for further development of a socially embodied collective artificial intelligence that is capable of guiding its own social structures.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Control Barrier Function with Provably Safe Guarantees: Reducing Conservatism with Heading-Aware Safety Margin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a learning-based Control Barrier Function (CBF) to reduce conservatism in collision avoidance of car-like robots. Traditional CBFs often use Euclidean distance between robots' centers as safety margin, neglecting headings and simplifying geometries to circles. While this ensures smooth, differentiable safety functions required by CBFs, it can be overly conservative in tight environments. To address this limitation, we design a heading-aware safety margin that accounts for the robots' orientations, enabling a less conservative and more accurate estimation of safe regions. Since the function computing this safety margin is non-differentiable, we approximate it with a neural network to ensure differentiability and facilitate integration with CBFs. We describe how we achieve bounded learning error and incorporate the upper bound into the CBF to provide formal safety guarantees through forward invariance. We show that our CBF is a high-order CBF with relative degree two for a system with two robots whose dynamics are modeled by the nonlinear kinematic bicycle model. Experimental results in overtaking and bypassing scenarios reveal a 33.5 % reduction in conservatism compared to traditional methods, while maintaining safety.

      <title>Information-Optimal Multi-Spacecraft Positioning for Interstellar Object Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs), astronomical objects not gravitationally bound to the sun, could present valuable opportunities to advance our understanding of the universe's formation and composition. In response to the unpredictable nature of their discoveries that inherently come with large and rapidly changing uncertainty in their state, this paper proposes a novel multi-spacecraft framework for locally maximizing information to be gained through ISO encounters with formal probabilistic guarantees. Given some approximated control and estimation policies for fully autonomous spacecraft operations, we first construct an ellipsoid around its terminal position, where the ISO would be located with a finite probability. The large state uncertainty of the ISO is formally handled here through the hierarchical property in stochastically contracting nonlinear systems. We then propose a method to find the terminal positions of the multiple spacecraft optimally distributed around the ellipsoid, which locally maximizes the information we can get from all the points of interest (POIs). This utilizes a probabilistic information cost function that accounts for spacecraft positions, camera specifications, and ISO position uncertainty, where the information is defined as visual data collected by cameras. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using synthetic ISO candidates generated from quasi-realistic empirical populations. Our method allows each spacecraft to optimally select its terminal state and determine the ideal number of POIs to investigate, potentially enhancing the ability to study these rare and fleeting interstellar visitors while minimizing resource utilization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fully characterize how dynamic information should be provided to uniquely implement the largest equilibrium in dynamic binary-action supermodular games. The designer offers an informational put: she stays silent in good times, but injects asymmetric and inconclusive public information if players lose faith. There is (i) no multiplicity gap: the largest (partially) implementable equilibrium can be implemented uniquely; and (ii) no intertemporal commitment gap: the policy is sequentially optimal. Our results have sharp implications for the design of policy in coordination environments.</description>

      <title>Strategic Sacrifice: Self-Organized Robot Swarm Localization for Inspection Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot swarms offer significant potential for inspecting diverse infrastructure, ranging from bridges to space stations. However, effective inspection requires accurate robot localization, which demands substantial computational resources and limits productivity. Inspired by biological systems, we introduce a novel cooperative localization mechanism that minimizes collective computation expenditure through self-organized sacrifice. Here, a few agents bear the computational burden of localization; through local interactions, they improve the inspection productivity of the swarm. Our approach adaptively maximizes inspection productivity for unconstrained trajectories in dynamic interaction and environmental settings. We demonstrate the optimality and robustness using mean-field analytical models, multi-agent simulations, and hardware experiments with metal climbing robots inspecting a 3D cylinder.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibrium seeking for a class of quadratic-bilinear Wasserstein distributionally robust games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Wasserstein distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problems, where agents construct heterogeneous data-driven Wasserstein ambiguity sets using private samples and radii, in line with their individual risk-averse behaviour. By leveraging relevant properties of this class of games, we show that equilibria of the original seemingly infinite-dimensional problem can be obtained as a solution to a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We then reformulate the problem as a finite-dimensional variational inequality and establish the connection between the corresponding solution sets. Our reformulation has scalable behaviour with respect to the data size and maintains a fixed number of constraints, independently of the number of samples. To compute a solution, we leverage two algorithms, based on the golden ratio algorithm. The efficiency of both algorithmic schemes is corroborated through extensive simulation studies on an illustrative example and a stochastic portfolio allocation game, where behavioural coupling among investors is modeled.</description>

      <title>Choreographing the Rhythms of Observation: Dynamics for Ranged Observer Bipartite-Unipartite SpatioTemporal (ROBUST) Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing network analysis methods struggle to optimize observer placements in dynamic environments with limited visibility. This dissertation introduces the novel ROBUST (Ranged Observer Bipartite-Unipartite SpatioTemporal) framework, offering a significant advancement in modeling, analyzing, and optimizing observer networks within complex spatiotemporal domains. ROBUST leverages a unique bipartite-unipartite approach, distinguishing between observer and observable entities while incorporating spatial constraints and temporal dynamics.
  This research extends spatiotemporal network theory by introducing novel graph-based measures, including myopic degree, spatial closeness centrality, and edge length proportion. These measures, coupled with advanced clustering techniques like Proximal Recurrence, provide insights into network structure, resilience, and the effectiveness of observer placements. The ROBUST framework demonstrates superior resource allocation and strategic responsiveness compared to conventional models. Case studies in oceanographic monitoring, urban safety networks, and multi-agent path planning showcases its practical applicability and adaptability. Results demonstrate significant improvements in coverage, response times, and overall network efficiency.
  This work paves the way for future research in incorporating imperfect knowledge, refining temporal pathing methodologies, and expanding the scope of applications. By bridging theoretical advancements with practical solutions, ROBUST stands as a significant contribution to the field, promising to inform and inspire ongoing and future endeavors in network optimization and multi-agent system planning.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Social Influence Maximization via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fairness in social influence maximization, whereby one seeks to select seeds that spread a given information throughout a network, ensuring balanced outreach among different communities (e.g. demographic groups). In the literature, fairness is often quantified in terms of the expected outreach within individual communities. In this paper, we demonstrate that such fairness metrics can be misleading since they overlook the stochastic nature of information diffusion processes. When information diffusion occurs in a probabilistic manner, multiple outreach scenarios can occur. As such, outcomes such as ``In 50\% of the cases, no one in group 1 gets the information, while everyone in group 2 does, and in the other 50%, it is the opposite'', which always results in largely unfair outcomes, are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature. We tackle this problem by designing a new fairness metric, mutual fairness, that captures variability in outreach through optimal transport theory. We propose a new seed-selection algorithm that optimizes both outreach and mutual fairness, and we show its efficacy on several real datasets. We find that our algorithm increases fairness with only a minor decrease (and at times, even an increase) in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Agent Loco-Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</description>
