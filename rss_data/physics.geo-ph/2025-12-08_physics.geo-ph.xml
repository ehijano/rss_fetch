      <title>EA-ERT: a new ensemble approach to convert time-lapse ERT data to soil water content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is increasingly used to study subsurface hydrological processes. It shows promising potential for estimating soil water content, a key but challenging property to quantify. However, converting the resistivity signal into water content is complex. This encourages developing approaches to increase the robustness of estimates while facilitating the evaluation of uncertainties. In this paper, we propose an innovative method, called the Ensemble Approach ERT (EA-ERT), to build an ensemble model of electrical resistivity calibrated from field data and then to convert it into a spatial distribution of water content. This approach combines time-lapse ERT data with point-based in-situ soil water content measurements. It enables i) circumventing inversion parameter choice by evaluating the performance of a large number of models, ii) estimating uncertainty in the final model by calculating the coefficient of variation among the models composing the ensemble, and iii) converting electrical resistivity models to water content. The method was tested at two dissimilar field sites in southern France. For each site, an ensemble model, built from multiple inversions, was selected and converted into soil water content. The calculated values showed a good fit, with small differences compared to in-situ measurements. Areas of high uncertainty were identified, providing complementary information to the more classical indicators from the inversion code. EA-ERT provides a robust and automatable method to convert ERT data to related parameters, contributing to improved monitoring and understanding processes in the subsurface.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of neutrino oscillations to the Earth's interior properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the Earth s internal structure remains a major challenge, as traditional geophysical methods face ambiguities in linking seismic observations to temperature, composition, or mass density variations. Atmospheric neutrinos offer a complementary probe: while traversing the Earth, they undergo flavor oscillations that depend on the local electron density, which reflects both mass density and composition.</description>

      <title>Helicity controls the direction of fluxes in rotating turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence sustains out-of-equilibrium fluxes that are shaped by conservation laws. Three-dimensional flows conserve energy and sign-indefinite helicity, both being transferred to small scales. Here, we uncover a dual organization of energy fluxes in 3D rotating flows, shaped by helicity. When sufficiently-fast inertial waves interact with a large-scale 2D flow, they conserve their helicity separately by sign. This causes an inverse energy transfer, from 3D to 2D motions, which promotes self-organization and spectral condensation. In contrast, slower modes exchange helicity with modes of opposite helicity sign, similarly to non-rotating 3D turbulence. This generates a forward energy transfer, from the large-scale 2D flow to small 3D scales, coexisting with the inverse transfer. We determine analytically these bi-directional energy transfers to the 2D mean flow via a quasi-linear wave-kinetic theory. The theory captures the main Reynolds number and rotation rate dependence of the mean-flow amplitude in Navier-Stokes simulations from zero to infinite rotation rates.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Growth in Stably Stratified Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate uncertainty growth and chaotic dynamics in statistically steady, stably stratified three-dimensional turbulence. Using direct numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations, we quantify the divergence of initially infinitesimal perturbations via twin simulations and decorrelator diagnostics. At short times, perturbations exhibit exponential growth, allowing us to define a (largest) Lyapunov exponent. We systematically examine how this exponent depends on stratification strength, quantified by the Brunt--V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} frequency and the Froude number, in a parameter regime relevant to oceanic flows. We find that increasing stratification leads to a monotonic reduction of the Lyapunov exponent, indicating suppressed chaoticity. Despite this reduction, uncertainty growth retains the universal temporal sequence observed in homogeneous isotropic turbulence -- initial decay, exponential growth, and saturation. The growth phase is characterized by self-similar decorrelator spectra, but exhibits strong anisotropy: uncertainty spreads much more slowly along the stratification direction than horizontally, with the disparity increasing with stratification strength. An analysis of the decorrelator evolution equation reveals that the suppression of chaos arises primarily from strain-mediated alignment dynamics rather than direct buoyancy coupling. Our results provide a quantitative characterization of predictability and uncertainty growth in stratified turbulence and highlight the utility of decorrelator-based methods for anisotropic geophysical flows.</description>
