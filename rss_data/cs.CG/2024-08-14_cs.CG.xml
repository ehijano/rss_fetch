      <title>Polynomial 2D Green Coordinates for High-order Cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose conformal polynomial coordinates for 2D closed high-order cages, which consist of polynomial curves of any order. The coordinates enable the transformation of the input polynomial curves into polynomial curves of any order. We extend the classical 2D Green coordinates to define our coordinates, thereby leading to cage-aware conformal harmonic deformations. We extensively test our method on various 2D deformations, allowing users to manipulate the \Bezier control points to easily generate the desired deformation.</description>

      <title>Invariants of almost embeddings of graphs in the plane: results and problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph drawing in the plane is called an almost embedding if images of any two non-adjacent simplices (i.e. vertices or edges) are disjoint. We introduce integer invariants of almost embeddings: winding number, cyclic and triodic Wu numbers. We construct almost embeddings realizing some values of these invariants. We prove some relations between the invariants. We study values realizable as invariants of some almost embedding, but not of any embedding.
  This paper is expository and is accessible to mathematicians not specialized in the area (and to students). However elementary, this paper is motivated by frontline of research.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo Beyond Hardy-Krause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical approaches to numerically integrating a function $f$ are Monte Carlo (MC) and quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. MC methods use random samples to evaluate $f$ and have error $O(\sigma(f)/\sqrt{n})$, where $\sigma(f)$ is the standard deviation of $f$. QMC methods are based on evaluating $f$ at explicit point sets with low discrepancy, and as given by the classical Koksma-Hlawka inequality, they have error $\widetilde{O}(\sigma_{\mathsf{HK}}(f)/n)$, where $\sigma_{\mathsf{HK}}(f)$ is the variation of $f$ in the sense of Hardy and Krause. These two methods have distinctive advantages and shortcomings, and a fundamental question is to find a method that combines the advantages of both.
  In this work, we give a simple randomized algorithm that produces QMC point sets with the following desirable features: (1) It achieves substantially better error than given by the classical Koksma-Hlawka inequality. In particular, it has error $\widetilde{O}(\sigma_{\mathsf{SO}}(f)/n)$, where $\sigma_{\mathsf{SO}}(f)$ is a new measure of variation that we introduce, which is substantially smaller than the Hardy-Krause variation. (2) The algorithm only requires random samples from the underlying distribution, which makes it as flexible as MC. (3) It automatically achieves the best of both MC and QMC (and the above improvement over Hardy-Krause variation) in an optimal way. (4) The algorithm is extremely efficient, with an amortized $\widetilde{O}(1)$ runtime per sample.
  Our method is based on the classical transference principle in geometric discrepancy, combined with recent algorithmic innovations in combinatorial discrepancy that besides producing low-discrepancy colorings, also guarantee certain subgaussian properties. This allows us to bypass several limitations of previous works in bridging the gap between MC and QMC methods and go beyond the Hardy-Krause variation.</description>

      <title>DC3DO: Diffusion Classifier for 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Geoffrey Hinton emphasis on generative modeling, To recognize shapes, first learn to generate them, we explore the use of 3D diffusion models for object classification. Leveraging the density estimates from these models, our approach, the Diffusion Classifier for 3D Objects (DC3DO), enables zero-shot classification of 3D shapes without additional training. On average, our method achieves a 12.5 percent improvement compared to its multiview counterparts, demonstrating superior multimodal reasoning over discriminative approaches. DC3DO employs a class-conditional diffusion model trained on ShapeNet, and we run inferences on point clouds of chairs and cars. This work highlights the potential of generative models in 3D object classification.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving Planar Simplification for Indoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for structure-preserving planar simplification of indoor scene point clouds for both simulated and real-world environments. Initially, the scene point cloud undergoes preprocessing steps, including noise reduction and Manhattan world alignment, to ensure robustness and coherence in subsequent analyses. We segment each captured scene into structured (walls-ceiling-floor) and non-structured (indoor objects) scenes. Leveraging a RANSAC algorithm, we extract primitive planes from the input point cloud, facilitating the segmentation and simplification of the structured scene. The best-fitting wall meshes are then generated from the primitives, followed by adjacent mesh merging with the vertex-translation algorithm which preserves the mesh layout. To accurately represent ceilings and floors, we employ the mesh clipping algorithm which clips the ceiling and floor meshes with respect to wall normals. In the case of indoor scenes, we apply a surface reconstruction technique to enhance the fidelity. This paper focuses on the intricate steps of the proposed scene simplification methodology, addressing complex scenarios such as multi-story and slanted walls and ceilings. We also conduct qualitative and quantitative performance comparisons against popular surface reconstruction, shape approximation, and floorplan generation approaches.</description>

      <title>A Practical Solver for Scalar Data Topological Simplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a practical approach for the optimization of topological simplification, a central pre-processing step for the analysis and visualization of scalar data. Given an input scalar field f and a set of "signal" persistence pairs to maintain, our approach produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of "non-signal" pairs, while (ii) preserving the "signal" pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification algorithms, our approach is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our approach enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our approach can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation for reproducibility purposes.</description>
