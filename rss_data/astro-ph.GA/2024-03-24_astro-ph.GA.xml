      <title>A candidate supermassive black hole in a gravitationally-lensed galaxy at $z\approx10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While supermassive black holes (BHs) are widely observed in the nearby and distant universe, their origin remains debated with two viable formation scenarios with light and heavy seeds. In the light seeding model, the first BHs form from the collapse of massive stars with masses of $10-100 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, while the heavy seeding model posits the formation of $10^{4-5} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ seeds from direct collapse. The detection of BHs at redshifts $z\gtrsim10$, edging closer to their formation epoch, provides critical observational discrimination between these scenarios. Here, we focus on the JWST-detected galaxy, GHZ 9, at $z\approx10$ that is lensed by the foreground cluster, Abell 2744. Based on 2.1 Ms deep Chandra observations, we detect a candidate X-ray AGN, which is spatially coincident with the high-redshift galaxy, GHZ 9. The BH candidate is inferred to have a bolometric luminosity of $(1.0^{+0.5}_{-0.4})\times10^{46} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$, which corresponds to a BH mass of $(8.0^{+3.7}_{-3.2})\times10^7 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington-limited accretion. This extreme mass at such an early cosmic epoch suggests the heavy seed origin for this BH candidate. Based on the Chandra and JWST discoveries of extremely high-redshift quasars, we have constructed the first simple AGN luminosity function extending to $z\approx10$. Comparison of this luminosity function with theoretical models indicates an over-abundant $z\approx10$ BH population, consistent with a higher-than-expected seed formation efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Cosmic Rays on the Observational Properties of the CGM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains information on the cumulative effect of galactic outflows over time, generally thought to be caused by feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei. Observations of such outflows via absorption in CGM gas of quasar sightlines show a significant amount of cold ($\lesssim 10^4 \; \rm{K}$) gas which cosmological simulations struggle to reproduce. Here, we use the adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical code RAMSES to investigate the effect of cosmic rays (CR) on the cold gas content of the CGM using three zoom realizations of a $z=1$ star-forming galaxy with supernova mechanical feedback: one with no CR feedback (referred to as no-CR), one with a medium CR diffusion coefficient $\kappa = 10^{28} \; \rm{cm^{2}\; s^{-1}}$ (CR$-\kappa_{\rm med}$), and one with a high rate of diffusion of $\kappa = 3\times10^{29} \; \rm{cm^{2}\; s^{-1}}$ (CR$-\kappa_{\rm high}$). We find that, for CR$-\kappa_{\rm med}$, the effects of CRs are largely confined to the galaxy itself as CRs do not extend far into the CGM. However, for CR$-\kappa_{\rm high}$, the CGM temperature is lowered and the amount of outflowing gas is boosted. Our CR simulations fall short of the observed Mg II covering fraction, a tracer of gas at temperatures $\lesssim 10^4 \; \rm{K}$, but the CR$-\kappa_{\rm high}$ simulation is more in agreement with covering fractions of C IV and O VI, which trace higher temperature gas.</description>

      <title>Connection between galaxy morphology and dark-matter halo structure I: a running threshold for thin discs and size predictors from the dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of studies on the connection between galaxy morphology and the structure of host dark-matter (DM) haloes using cosmological simulations. In this work, we introduce a new kinematic decomposition scheme that features physical identification of morphological components, enabling robust separation of thin and thick discs; and measure a wide range of halo properties, including their locations in the cosmic web, internal structures, and assembly histories. Our analysis of the TNG50 simulation reveals that the orbital-circularity threshold for disc differentiation varies across galaxies, with systematic trends in mass and redshift, so the widely used decomposition method with constant circularity cuts is oversimplified and underestimates thin disc at JWST redshifts. The energy threshold between the stellar halo and the inner galaxy is also a function of mass and redshift, minimizing at the sub-Galactic halo mass, where the circularity threshold peaks. Revisiting the issue of galaxy size predictor, we show that disc sizes in TNG50 exhibit correlations with three structural parameters besides virial mass and redshift: 1) a positive correlation with halo spin $\lambda$ across redshifts -- stronger than previously reported for zoom-in simulations but still weaker than the simple $r_{1/2}/R_{\rm vir} \propto \lambda$ scaling; 2) an anti-correlation with DM concentration $c$ that is well described by $r_{1/2}/R_{\rm vir} \propto c^{-0.7}$ even when $c$ is measured in the DM only run; 3) more actively accreting haloes having slightly larger discs, as well as more significant stellar haloes and lower thin-to-thick ratio. Disc mass fraction is higher in rounder haloes and in cosmic knots and filaments, implying that disc development needs both stable halo conditions and continuous material supply. Our methodology is public and adaptable to other simulations.</description>

      <title>GOALS-JWST: The Warm Molecular Outflows of the Merging Starburst Galaxy NGC 3256</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Integral Field Spectrograph observations of NGC 3256, a local infrared-luminous late-stage merging system with two nuclei about 1 kpc apart, both of which have evidence of cold molecular outflows. Using JWST NIRSpec and MIRI datasets, we investigate this morphologically complex system on spatial scales of $&lt;$100 pc, where we focus on the warm molecular H$_2$ gas surrounding the nuclei. We detect collimated outflowing warm H$_2$ gas originating from the southern nucleus, though we do not find significant outflowing warm H$_2$ gas surrounding the northern nucleus. Within the observed region, the maximum intrinsic velocities of the outflow reach up to $\sim$1,000 km s$^{-1}$, and extend out to a distance of 0.7 kpc. Based on H$_2$ S(7)/S(1) line ratios, we find a larger fraction of warmer gas near the S nucleus, which decreases with increasing distance from the nucleus, signifying the S nucleus as a primary source of H$_2$ heating. The gas mass of the warm H$_2$ outflow component is estimated to be $M\rm{_{warm,out}}$ = 8.9$\times$10$^5\;M_{\odot}$, as much as 4$\%$ of the cold H$_2$ mass as estimated using ALMA CO data. The outflow time scale is about $7\times10^5$ yr, resulting in a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}\rm{_{warm,out}}$ = 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic power of $P\rm{_{warm,out}}\;\sim\;2\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Lastly, the regions where the outflowing gas reside show high [FeII]/Pa$\beta$ and H$_2$/Br$\gamma$ line ratios, indicating enhanced mechanical heating caused by the outflows. At the same time, the 3.3 $\mu$m and 6.2 $\mu$m Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon fluxes in these regions are not significantly suppressed compared to those outside the outflows, suggesting the outflows have no clear negative feedback effect on the local star formation.</description>

      <title>Modelling of surface brightness fluctuation measurements: Methodology, uncertainty, and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to scrutinise the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) calculation methodology. We analysed the SBF derivation procedure, measured the accuracy of the fitted SBF under controlled conditions, retrieved the uncertainty associated with the variability of a system that is inherently stochastic, and studied the SBF reliability under a wide range of conditions. Additionally, we address the possibility of an SBF gradient detection. We also examine the problems related with biased measurements of the SBF and low luminosity sources. All of this information allows us to put forward guidelines to ensure a valid SBF retrieval. To perform all these experiments, we carried out Monte Carlo simulations of mock galaxies as an ideal laboratory. Knowing its underlying properties, we attempted to retrieve SBFs under different conditions. We show how the SBF uncertainty can be obtained and we present a collection of qualitative recommendations for a safe SBF retrieval: it is important to model the instrumental noise, rather than fitting it; the target galaxies must be observed under appropriate observational conditions; in a traditional SBF derivation, one should avoid pixels with fluxes lower than ten times the SBF estimate to prevent biased results. We offer our computational implementation in the form of a simple code designed to estimate the uncertainty of the SBF measurement. This code can be used to predict the quality of future observations or to evaluate the reliability of those already conducted.</description>

      <title>The central black hole in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo I Not supermassive, at most an intermediate-mass candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently claimed that a surprisingly massive black hole (BH) is present in the core of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) Leo I. Based on integral field spectroscopy, this finding challenges the typical expectation of dSphs hosting BHs of intermediate-mass, since such a BH would better be classified as supermassive. Indeed, the analysis points toward Leo I harboring a BH with a lower mass limit exceeding a few $10^6M_\odot$ at $1\sigma$, and the no BH case excluded at 95\% significance. Such a value, comparable to the entire stellar mass of the galaxy, makes Leo I a unique system that warrants further investigations. Using equilibrium models based on distribution functions (DFs) depending on actions $f({\boldsymbol J})$ coupled with the same integral field spectroscopy data and an extensive exploration of a very large parameter space, we demonstrate, within a comprehensive Bayesian framework of model-data comparison, that the posterior on the BH mass is flat towards the low-mass end and, thus, that the kinematics of the central galaxy region only imposes an upper limit on the BH mass of few $10^5M_\odot$ (at $3\sigma$). Such an upper limit brings back the putative BH of Leo I under the category of intermediate-mass BHs, and it is also in line with formation scenarios and expectations from scaling relations at the mass regime of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>First detection of outflowing gas in the outskirts of the broad line region in 1H-0707-495</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy covering simultaneously the $zJHK$ bands to look for outflowing gas from the nuclear environment of 1H0707-495 taking advantage that this region is dominated by low-ionization broad line region (BLR) lines, most of them isolated. We detect broad components in HI, FeII and OI, at rest to the systemic velocity, displaying full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of ~500 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with its classification as a narrow-line Seyfert~1 AGN. Moreover, most lines display a conspicuous blue-asymmetric profile, modeled using a blueshifted component, whose velocity shift reaches up to ~826 km s$^{-1}$. This last feature can be interpreted in terms of outflowing gas already observed in X-ray and UV lines in 1H0707-495 but not detected before in the low-ionization lines. We discuss the relevance of our findings within the framework of the wind scenario already proposed for this source and suggest that the wind extends well into the narrow line region due to the observation of a blueshifted component in the forbidden line of [SIII] $\lambda$9531.</description>

      <title>NSCs from groups to clusters: A catalogue of dwarf galaxies in the Shapley Supercluster and the role of environment in galaxy nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are dense star clusters located at the centre of galaxies spanning a wide range of masses and morphologies. Analysing NSC occupation statistics in different environments provides an invaluable window into investigating early conditions of high-density star formation and mass assembly in clusters and group galaxies. We use HST/ACS deep imaging to obtain a catalogue of dwarf galaxies in two galaxy clusters in the Shapley Supercluster: the central cluster Abell 3558 and the northern Abell 1736a. The Shapley region is an ideal laboratory to study nucleation as it stands as the highest mass concentration in the nearby Universe. We investigate the NSC occurrence in quiescent dwarf galaxies as faint as $M_{I} = -10$ mag and compare it with all other environments where nucleation data is available. We use galaxy cluster/group halo mass as a proxy for the environment and employ a Bayesian logistic regression framework to model the nucleation fraction ($f_{n}$) as a function of galaxy luminosity and environment. We find a notably high $f_n$ in Abell 3558: at $M_{I} \approx -13.1$ mag, half the galaxies in the cluster host NSCs. This is higher than in the Virgo and Fornax clusters but comparable to the Coma Cluster. On the other hand, the $f_n$ in Abell 1736a is relatively lower, comparable to groups in the Local Volume. We find that the probability of nucleation varies with galaxy luminosity remarkably similarly in galaxy clusters. These results reinforce previous findings of the important role of the environment in NSC formation/growth.</description>

      <title>Origin of the correlation between stellar kinematics and globular cluster system richness in ultra-diffuse galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational surveys have found that the dynamical masses of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) correlate with the richness of their globular cluster (GC) system. This could be explained if GC-rich galaxies formed in more massive dark matter haloes. We use simulations of galaxies and their GC systems from the E-MOSAICS project to test whether the simulations reproduce such a trend. We find that GC-rich simulated galaxies in galaxy groups have enclosed masses that are consistent with the dynamical masses of observed GC-rich UDGs. However, simulated GC-poor galaxies in galaxy groups have higher enclosed masses than those observed. We argue that GC-poor UDGs with low stellar velocity dispersions are discs observed nearly face on, such that their true mass is underestimated by observations. Using the simulations, we show that galactic star-formation conditions resulting in dispersion-supported stellar systems also leads to efficient GC formation. Conversely, conditions leading to rotationally-supported discs leads to inefficient GC formation. This result may explain why early-type galaxies typically have richer GC systems than late-type galaxies. This is also supported by comparisons of stellar axis ratios and GC specific frequencies in observed dwarf galaxy samples, which show GC-rich systems are consistent with being spheroidal, while GC-poor systems are consistent with being discs. Therefore, particularly for GC-poor galaxies, rotation should be included in dynamical mass measurements from stellar dynamics.</description>

      <title>Radial Wave in the Galactic Disk: New Clues to Discriminate Different Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding the key dynamical processes that shape the Galactic disk structure is crucial for reconstructing the Milky Way's evolution history. The second Gaia data release unveils a novel wave pattern in the $L_Z-\langle V_R\rangle$ space, but its formation mechanism remains elusive due to the intricate nature of involved perturbations and the challenges in disentangling their effects. Utilizing the latest Gaia DR3 data, we find that the $L_Z-\langle V_R\rangle$ wave systematically shifts towards lower $L_Z$ for dynamically hotter stars. The amplitude of this phase shift between stars of different dynamical hotness ($\Delta L_Z$) peaks around $\mathrm{2300\,km\,s^{-1}\,kpc}$. To differentiate the role of different perturbations, we perform three sets of test particle simulations, wherein a satellite galaxy, corotating transient spiral arms, and a bar plus the corotating transient spiral arms act as the sole perturber, respectively. Under the satellite impact, the phase shift amplitude decreases towards higher $L_Z$, which we interpret through a toy model of radial phase mixing. While the corotating transient spiral arms do not generate an azimuthally universal phase shift variation pattern, combining the bar and spirals generates a characteristic $\Delta L_Z$ peak at 2:1 Outer Lindblad Resonance, qualitatively resembling the observed feature. Therefore, the $L_Z-\langle V_R\rangle$ is more likely of internal origin. Furthermore, linking the $\Delta L_Z$ peak to the 2:1 Lindblad resonance offers a novel approach to estimating the pattern speed of the Galactic Bar, supporting the long/slow bar model.</description>

      <title>Millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy of the deuterated molecular ion SD+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seven rotational and fine-structure transitions of the deuterated molecular ion SD+ in the X 3S- ground electronic state have been measured in the 271-863 GHz region in the laboratory. This ion has been produced by DC-glow discharge using a mixture of D2S and argon in a free space cell in a temperature range of -140 to -160C. The rotational, centrifugal distortion, spin-spin interaction, and hyperfine constants have been determined; the standard deviation of the residuals in the fitting is 109 kHz. The set of obtained spectroscopic parameters provides a list of accurate sub-millimeter rest frequencies of SD+ for astronomical detection. We have investigated lines of SD+ toward the quasar PKS 1830-211 using the ALMA archive, as the z = 0.89 molecular absorber exists in front of this quasar. A data set covering the 297 GHz region includes the N_J = 2_3-1_2 transition at 561 GHz due to redshift, providing an upper limit of the column density Ntot = 3 x 10^12 cm-2 for SD+.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington accretion in high-redshift black holes and the emergence of jetted AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the co-evolution of central black holes (BHs) and host galaxies by utilizing an advanced iteration of the DELPHI semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution. Based on dark matter halo merger trees spanning the redshift range from $z=20$ to $z=4$, it now incorporates essential components such as gas heating and cooling, cold and hot BH accretion, jet and radiative AGN feedback. We show how different BH growth models impact quasar and galaxy observables at $z \geq 5$, providing predictions that will help discriminate between super-Eddington and Eddington-limited accretion models: despite being both consistent with observed properties of SMBHs and their host galaxies at $z \sim 5-7$, they become very clearly distinguishable at higher redshift and in the intermediate mass regime. We find that the super-Eddington model, unlike the Eddington-limited scenario, predicts a gap in the BH mass function corresponding to the intermediate-mass range $10^4 \mathrm{M_\odot} &lt; M_\mathrm{bh} &lt; 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$. Additionally, it predicts black holes up to two orders of magnitude more massive for the same stellar mass at $z=9$. The resulting velocity dispersion - BH mass relation at $z \geq 5$ is consistent with local measurements, suggesting that its slope and normalisation are independent of redshift. Depending on the Eddington ratio, we also model the emergence of AGN jets, predicting their duty cycle across as a function of BH mass and their potential impact on the observed number density distribution of high-redshift AGN in the hard X-ray band.</description>

      <title>Galaxy merger challenge: A comparison study between machine learning-based detection methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various galaxy merger detection methods have been applied to diverse datasets. However, it is difficult to understand how they compare. We aim to benchmark the relative performance of machine learning (ML) merger detection methods. We explore six leading ML methods using three main datasets. The first one (the training data) consists of mock observations from the IllustrisTNG simulations and allows us to quantify the performance metrics of the detection methods. The second one consists of mock observations from the Horizon-AGN simulations, introduced to evaluate the performance of classifiers trained on different, but comparable data. The third one consists of real observations from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey. For the binary classification task (mergers vs. non-mergers), all methods perform reasonably well in the domain of the training data. At $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3$, precision and recall range between $\sim$70\% and 80\%, both of which decrease with increasing $z$ as expected (by $\sim$5\% for precision and $\sim$10\% for recall at $0.76&lt;z&lt;1.0$). When transferred to a different domain, the precision of all classifiers is only slightly reduced, but the recall is significantly worse (by $\sim$20-40\% depending on the method). Zoobot offers the best overall performance in terms of precision and F1 score. When applied to real HSC observations, all methods agree well with visual labels of clear mergers but can differ by more than an order of magnitude in predicting the overall fraction of major mergers. For the multi-class classification task to distinguish pre-, post- and non-mergers, none of the methods offer a good performance, which could be partly due to limitations in resolution and depth of the data. With the advent of better quality data (e.g. JWST and Euclid), it is important to improve our ability to detect mergers and distinguish between merger stages.</description>

      <title>Polarization Holes as an Indicator of Magnetic Field-Angular Momentum Alignment I. Initial Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of protostellar disks is still a mystery, largely due to the difficulties in observations that can constrain theories. For example, the 3D alignment between the rotation of the disk and the magnetic fields (B-fields) in the formation environment is critical in some models, but so far impossible to observe. Here, we study the possibility of probing the alignment between B-field and disk rotation using ``polarization holes'' (PHs). PHs are widely observed and are caused by unresolved B-field structures. With ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we demonstrate that different initial alignments between B-field and angular momentum (AM) can result in B-field structures that are distinct enough to produce distinguishable PHs. Thus PHs can potentially serve as probes for alignments between B-field and AM in disk formation.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested disks in FR I radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sample of 17 FR I radio galaxies constructed from the 3CR catalog, which is characterized by edge-darkened radio structures, is studied. The optical core luminosities derived from Hubble Space Telescope observation are used to estimate the Eddington ratios which are found to be below $10^{-3.4}$ for this sample. This is supported by the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich optical diagnostic diagrams derived with the spectroscopic observation of Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, suggesting that these sources are of low ionization nuclear Emission-line Regions (LINERs). It implies that the accretion in these FR I sources can be modeled as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). Given the low accretion rate, the predicted jet power with a fast-spinning black hole (BH) $a=0.95$ in the Blandford-Znajek mechanics is lower than the estimated one for almost all the sources in our sample. Such powerful jets indicate the presence of magnetically arrested disks (MAD) in the inner region of the ADAF, in the sense that the magnetic fields in the inner accretion zone are strong. Moreover, we show that, even in the MAD scenario, the BH spins in the sample are most likely moderate and/or fast with $a\gtrsim0.5$.</description>

      <title>Decaying turbulence in molecular clouds: how does it affect filament networks and star formation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fragmentation of gas to form stars in molecular clouds is intrinsically linked to the turbulence within them. These internal motions are set at the birth of the cloud and may vary with galactic environment and as the cloud evolves. In this paper, we introduce a new suite of 15 high-resolution 3D molecular cloud simulations using the moving mesh code AREPO to investigate the role of different decaying turbulent modes (mixed, compressive and solenoidal) and virial ratios on the evolution of a $10^4\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ molecular cloud. We find that diffuse regions maintain a strong relic of the initial turbulent mode, whereas the initial gravitational potential dominates dense regions. Solenoidal seeded models thus give rise to a diffuse cloud with filament-like morphology, and an excess of brown dwarf mass fragments. Compressive seeded models have an early onset of star-formation, centrally condensed morphologies and a higher accretion rate, along with overbound clouds. 3D filaments identified using DisPerSE and analyzed through a new Python toolkit we develop and make publicly available with this work called FIESTA, show no clear trend in lengths, masses and densities between initial turbulent modes. Overbound clouds, however, produce more filaments and thus have more mass in filaments. The hubs formed by converging filaments are found to favour star-formation, with surprisingly similar mass distributions independent of the number of filaments connecting the hub.</description>

      <title>Testing strengths, limitations and biases of current Pulsar Timing Arrays detection analyses on realistic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art searches for gravitational waves (GWs) in pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets model the signal as an isotropic, Gaussian and stationary process described by a power-law. In practice, none of these properties are expected to hold for an incoherent superposition of GWs generated by a cosmic ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which is expected to be the primary signal in the PTA band. We perform a systematic investigation of the performance of current search algorithms, using a simple power law model to characterize GW signals in realistic datasets. We use, as the baseline dataset, synthetic realisations of timing residuals mimicking the European PTA (EPTA) second data release (DR2). Thus, we include in the dataset uneven time stamps, achromatic and chromatic red noise and multi-frequency observations. We then inject timing residuals from an ideal isotropic, Gaussian, single power-law stochastic process and from a realistic population of SMBHBs, performing a methodical investigation of the recovered signal. We find that current search models are efficient at recovering the GW signal, but several biases can be identified due to the signal-template mismatch, which we identify via probability-probability (P-P) plots and quantify using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics. We discuss our findings in light of the signal observed in the EPTA DR2 and corroborate its consistency with an SMBHB origin.</description>

      <title>High mass function ellipsoidal variables in the Gaia Focused Product Release: searching for black hole candidates in the binary zoo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent Gaia Focused Product Release contains radial velocity time-series for more than 9,000 Gaia long-period photometric variables. Here we search for binary systems with large radial velocity amplitudes to identify candidates with massive, unseen companions. Eight targets have binary mass function $f(M)&gt;1\ M_\odot$, three of which are eclipsing binaries. The remaining five show evidence of ellipsoidal modulations. We fit spectroscopic orbit models to the Gaia radial velocities, and fit the spectral energy distributions of three targets. For the two systems most likely to host dark companions, J0946 and J1640, we use PHOEBE to fit the ASAS-SN light curves and Gaia radial velocities. The derived companion masses are $&gt;3 M_\odot$, but the high Galactic dust extinctions towards these objects limit our ability to rule out main sequence companions or subgiants hotter than the photometric primaries. These systems are similar to other stellar-mass black hole impostors, notably the Unicorn (V723 Mon) and the Giraffe (2M04123153$+$6738486). While it is possible that J1640 and J0946 are similar examples of stripped giant star binaries, high-resolution spectra can be used to determine the nature of their companions.</description>

      <title>Establishing a mass-loss rate relation for red supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high mass-loss rates of red supergiants (RSGs) drastically affect their evolution and final fate, but their mass-loss mechanism remains poorly understood. Various empirical prescriptions scaled with luminosity have been derived in the literature, yielding results with a dispersion of 2-3 orders of magnitude. We determine an accurate mass-loss rate relation with luminosity and other parameters using a large, clean sample of RSGs and explain the discrepancy between previous works. We assembled a sample of 2,219 RSG candidates in the Large Magellanic Cloud, with ultraviolet to mid-infrared photometry in up to 49 filters. We determined the luminosity of each RSG by integrating the spectral energy distribution and the mass-loss rate using the radiative transfer code DUSTY. Our derived RSG mass-loss rates range from $10^{-9} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ to $10^{-5} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, mainly depending on the luminosity. The average mass-loss rate is $9.3\times 10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for $\log{(L/L_\odot)}&gt;4$. We established a mass-loss rate relation as a function of luminosity and effective temperature. Furthermore, we found a turning point in the relation of mass-loss rate versus luminosity relation at approximately $\log{(L/L_\odot)} = 4.4$, indicating enhanced rates beyond this limit. We show that this enhancement correlates with photometric variability. Moreover, we compared our results with prescriptions from the literature, finding an agreement with works assuming steady-state winds. Additionally, we examined the effect of different assumptions on our models and found that radiatively driven winds result in mass-loss rates higher by 2-3 orders of magnitude, which are unrealistically high for RSGs. Finally, we found that 21% of our sample constitute current binary candidates. This has a minor effect on our mass-loss relation.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Stability of Spherical Systems in MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the non-linear stability of a large class of spherically symmetric equilibrium solutions of both the collisonless Boltzmann equation and of the Euler equations in MOND. This is the first such stability result that is proven with mathematical rigour in MOND. While we strive to prove our stability theorems, we develop new, genuinely Mondian ideas how arising mathematical difficulties can be solved. At some points it was necessary to restrict our analysis to spherical symmetry. We discuss every point where this extra assumption was necessary and outline which efforts must be undertaken to get along without it in future works. In the end we show on the example of a polytropic model how our stability result can be applied.</description>

      <title>Moving Towards Automated Interstellar Boundary Explorer Data Selection with LOTUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite collects data on energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that provide insight into the heliosphere, the region surrounding our solar system and separating it from interstellar space. IBEX collects information on these particles and on extraneous ``background'' particles. While IBEX records how and when the different particles are observed, it does not distinguish between heliospheric ENA particles and incidental background particles. To address this issue, all IBEX data has historically been manually labeled as ``good'' ENA data, or ``bad'' background data. This manual culling process is incredibly time-intensive and contingent on subjective, manually-induced decision thresholds. In this paper, we develop a three-stage automated culling process, called LOTUS, that uses random forests to expedite and standardize the labelling process. In Stage 1, LOTUS uses random forests to obtain probabilities of observing true ENA particles on a per-observation basis. In Stage 2, LOTUS aggregates these probabilities to obtain predictions within small windows of time. In Stage 3, LOTUS refines these predictions. We compare the labels generated by LOTUS to those manually generated by the subject matter expert. We use various metrics to demonstrate that LOTUS is a useful automated process for supplementing and standardizing the manual culling process.</description>
