      <title>Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Landscape of Non-Equilibrium Memories with Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized. Interactive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available at https://memorynca.github.io/2D.</description>

      <title>Dominant vertices and attractors' landscape for Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous works, we introduced the notion of dominant vertices. This is a set of nodes in the underlying network whose evolution determines the whole network's dynamics after a transient time. In this paper, we focus on the case of Boolean networks. We define a reduced graph on the dominant vertices and an induced automata network on this graph, which we prove is asymptotically equivalent to the original Boolean dynamics. Asymptotic conjugacy ensures that the systems, restricted to their respective attractors, are dynamically equivalent. For a significant class of networks, the induced automata network is indeed a reduction of the original system. In these cases, the reduction, which is obtained from the structure of dominant vertices, supplies a more tractable system with the same structure of attractors as the original one. Furthermore, the structure of the induced system allows us to establish bounds on the number and period of the attractors, as well as on the reduction of the basin's sizes and transient lengths. We illustrate this reduction by considering a class of networks, which we call clover networks, whose dominant set is a singleton. To get insight into the structure of the basins of attraction of Boolean networks with a single dominant vertex, we complement this work with a numerical exploration of the behavior of a parametrized ensemble of systems of this kind.</description>
