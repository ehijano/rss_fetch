      <title>Portfolio Analysis Based on Markowitz Stochastic Dominance Criteria: A Behavioral Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops stochastic optimization problems for describing and analyzing behavioral investors with Markowitz Stochastic Dominance (MSD) preferences. Specifically, we establish dominance conditions in a discrete state-space to capture all reverse S-shaped MSD preferences as well as all subjective decision weights generated by inverse S-shaped probability weighting functions. We demonstrate that these dominance conditions can be admitted as linear constraints into the stochastic optimization problems to formulate computationally tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models. We then employ the developed MILP models in financial portfolio analysis and examine classic behavioral factors such as reference point and subjective probability distortion in behavioral investors' portfolio decisions.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Portfolio Risk: Forecasting Volatility Through Cointegrated Asset Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Historical and Dynamic Volatility Ratios (HVR/DVR) and show that equity and index volatilities are cointegrated at intraday and daily horizons. This allows us to construct a VECM to forecast portfolio volatility by exploiting volatility cointegration. On S&amp;P 500 data, HVR is generally stationary and cointegration with the index is frequent; the VECM implementation yields substantially lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) than covariance-based forecasts at short- to medium-term horizons across portfolio sizes. The approach is interpretable and readily implementable, factorizing covariance into market volatility, relative-volatility ratios, and correlations.</description>

      <title>From Headlines to Holdings: Deep Learning for Smarter Portfolio Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning offers new tools for portfolio optimization. We present an end-to-end framework that directly learns portfolio weights by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model temporal patterns, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture evolving inter-stock relationships, and sentiment analysis of financial news to reflect market psychology. Unlike prior approaches, our model unifies these elements in a single pipeline that produces daily allocations. It avoids the traditional two-step process of forecasting asset returns and then applying mean--variance optimization (MVO), a sequence that can introduce instability. We evaluate the framework on nine U.S. stocks spanning six sectors, chosen to balance sector diversity and news coverage. In this setting, the model delivers higher cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios than equal-weighted and CAPM-based MVO benchmarks. Although the stock universe is limited, the results underscore the value of integrating price, relational, and sentiment signals for portfolio management and suggest promising directions for scaling the approach to larger, more diverse asset sets.</description>

      <title>Conditional Risk Minimization with Side Information: A Tractable, Universal Optimal Transport Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional risk minimization arises in high-stakes decisions where risk must be assessed in light of side information, such as stressed economic conditions, specific customer profiles, or other contextual covariates. Constructing reliable conditional distributions from limited data is notoriously difficult, motivating a series of optimal-transport-based proposals that address this uncertainty in a distributionally robust manner. Yet these approaches remain fragmented, each constrained by its own limitations: some rely on point estimates or restrictive structural assumptions, others apply only to narrow classes of risk measures, and their structural connections are unclear. We introduce a universal framework for distributionally robust conditional risk minimization, built on a novel union-ball formulation in optimal transport. This framework offers three key advantages: interpretability, by subsuming existing methods as special cases and revealing their deep structural links; tractability, by yielding convex reformulations for virtually all major risk functionals studied in the literature; and scalability, by supporting cutting-plane algorithms for large-scale conditional risk problems. Applications to portfolio optimization with rank-dependent expected utility highlight the practical effectiveness of the framework, with conditional models converging to optimal solutions where unconditional ones clearly do not.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Approach to (Meta)Relational Models Theory, and its Application to Triple Bottom Line (Profit, People, Planet) - Towards Social Relations Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the optimal nature of social interactions among actors (e.g., people or firms), who seek to achieve certain mutually-agreed objectives, has been the subject of extensive academic research. Using the relational models theory (describing all social interactions as combinations of four basic sociality ingredients: Communal Sharing, Authority Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing), the common approach revolves around qualitative arguments for determining sociality configurations most effective in realizing specific purposes, at times supplemented by empirical data. In the current treatment, we formulate this question as a mathematical optimization problem, in order to quantitatively derive the most suitable combination of sociality forms for dyadic actors, which optimizes their mutually-agreed objective. For this purpose, we develop an analytical framework of the (meta)relational models theory, and demonstrate that combining the four sociality forms to define a specific meaningful social situation inevitably prompts an inherent tension among them, codified by a single elementary and universal metarelation. In analogy with financial portfolio management, we subsequently introduce the concept of Social Relations Portfolio (SRP) management, and propose a generalizable methodology capable of quantitatively identifying the efficient SRP, which, in turn, enables effective stakeholder and change management initiatives. As an important illustration, the methodology is applied to the Triple Bottom Line (Profit, People, Planet) paradigm to derive its efficient SRP. This serves as a guide to practitioners for precisely measuring, monitoring, reporting and steering stakeholder and change management efforts concerning Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) within and / or across organizations.</description>
