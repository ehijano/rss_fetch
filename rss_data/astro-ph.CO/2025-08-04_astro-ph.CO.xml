      <title>Segmenting proto-halos with vision transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of dark-matter halos from small cosmological perturbations generated in the early universe is a highly non-linear process typically modeled through N-body simulations. In this work, we explore the use of deep learning to segment and classify proto-halo regions in the initial density field according to their final halo mass at redshift $z=0$. We compare two architectures: a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the V-Net design and a U-Net transformer. We find that the transformer-based network significantly outperforms the CNN across all metrics, achieving sub-percent error in the total segmented mass per halo class. Both networks deliver much higher accuracy than the perturbation-theory-based model \textsc{pinocchio}, especially at low halo masses and in the detailed reconstruction of proto-halo boundaries. We also investigate the impact of different input features by training models on the density field, the tidal shear, and their combination. Finally, we use Grad-CAM to generate class-activation heatmaps for the CNN, providing preliminary yet suggestive insights into how the network exploits the input fields.</description>

      <title>Effective Theories of Redshift-Space Galaxy Peculiar Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present predictions for redshift-space peculiar velocity statistics in the Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations of the effective field theory (EFT) of large-scale structure. We compute 2-point pairwise velocity statistics up to the second moment at next-to-leading (1-loop) order, showing that they can be modeled together with redshift-space galaxy densities with a consistent set of EFT coefficients. We show that peculiar velocity statistics have a distinct dependence on long-wavelength bulk flows that necessitates a variation on the usual infrared (IR) resummation procedure used to model baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy clustering. This can be implemented recursively in powers of the velocity in both the Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks. We validate our analytic calculations against fully nonlinear N-body simulations, demonstrating that they can be used to recover the growth rate at better than percent level precision, well beyond the statistical requirements of upcoming peculiar velocity surveys and measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. As part of this work, we release $\texttt{velocisaurus}$, a fast $\texttt{Python}$ code for computing EFT predictions of peculiar velocity statistics.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Assessing the Impact of Dust Complexity on the Recovery of Primordial $B$-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how dust foreground complexity can affect measurements of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, in the context of the Simons Observatory, using a cross-spectrum component separation analysis. Employing a suite of simulations with realistic Galactic dust emission, we find that spatial variation in the dust frequency spectrum, parametrized by $\beta_d$, can bias the estimate for $r$ when modeled using a low-order moment expansion to capture this spatial variation. While this approach performs well across a broad range of dust complexity, the bias increases with more extreme spatial variation in dust frequency spectrum, reaching as high as $r\sim0.03$ for simulations with no primordial tensors and a spatial dispersion of $\sigma(\beta_d)\simeq0.3$ -- the most extreme case considered, yet still consistent with current observational constraints. This bias is driven by changes in the $\ell$-dependence of the dust power spectrum as a function of frequency that can mimic a primordial $B$-mode tensor signal. Although low-order moment expansions fail to capture the full effect when the spatial variations of $\beta_d$ become large and highly non-Gaussian, our results show that extended parametric methods can still recover unbiased estimates of $r$ under a wide range of dust complexities. We further find that the bias in $r$, at the highest degrees of dust complexity, is largely insensitive to the spatial structure of the dust amplitude and is instead dominated by spatial correlations between $\beta_d$ and dust amplitude, particularly at higher orders. If $\beta_d$ does spatially vary at the highest levels investigated here, we would expect to use more flexible foreground models to achieve an unbiased constraint on $r$ for the noise levels anticipated from the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>An investigation of a varying G through Strong Lensing and SNe Ia observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the potential variation of the gravitational constant $G$ using data from strong gravitational lensing systems and Type Ia supernovae. Testing $G(z)$ parameterizations where $G(z) = G_0(1 + G_1z)$ and $G(z) = G_0(1 + z)^{G_1}$, we also account for the influence of $G$ on the luminosity of SNe Ia through the Chandrasekhar mass-luminosity relation. Only the flat universe hypothesis is considered. Constraints from 158 lensing systems and the Pantheon+ sample show no significant evidence of $G$ variation. However, although the results are compatible with no variation, the errors are not yet sufficiently restrictive to rule out any variation of $G$ with high statistical confidence. This study highlights the viability of using combined astrophysical data to probe variations in fundamental constants, suggesting that future surveys could refine these constraints.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Trajectories calculation with state of the art lattice QCD equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the full cosmic trajectories of the early Universe across the QCD phase diagram as the plasma cools from $T\simeq500\,$MeV to $30\,$MeV, assuming $\beta$-equilibrated matter. The trajectories are obtained by simultaneously solving baryon-number, electric-charge, and lepton-asymmetry conservation, closed by a state-of-the-art lattice-QCD equation of state: a fourth-order Taylor expansion in the chemical potentials that merges the latest $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor susceptibilities with charm-quark contributions, thus delivering a consistent $(2\!+\!1\!+\!1)$-flavor equation of state. Results are compared with an ideal quark-gluon plasma and with a hadron-resonance gas to highlight interaction effects. Two cases of primordial lepton asymmetries are analyzed: a symmetric configuration $(\ell_e=\ell_\mu=\ell_\tau=\ell/3)$ and an asymmetric one $(\ell_e=0,\;\ell_\mu=-\ell_\tau)$. Increasing $|\ell|$ systematically drives the trajectories toward larger values of $\mu_B$ and more negative $\mu_Q$. In the asymmetric case, a non-monotonic bounce develops when the $\tau$ chemical potential reaches $m_\tau$, generating a maximum in $\mu_B(T)$, the position of which depends on $\ell_\tau$. Assuming a modest $\mu_{Q}$-dependence of the lattice-QCD critical end point estimates (obtained at $\mu_{Q} = 0$), the trajectories for all lepton asymmetries explored ($|\ell|\lesssim 0.1$) lie to their left, implying that in a standard cosmological scenario the QCD transition is almost certainly a smooth crossover. Nevertheless, we estimate the magnitude of baryon and lepton asymmetries needed to obtain a cosmic trajectory closer to the QCD critical point, providing inputs for future studies of the strong-interaction epoch.</description>

      <title>Rapid cosmological inference with the two-loop matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop effective field theory (EFT) power spectrum of dark matter density fluctuations in $\Lambda$CDM using the recently proposed COBRA method (Bakx. et al, 2025). With COBRA, we are able to evaluate the two-loop matter power spectrum in $\sim 1$ millisecond at $ \sim 0.1 \%$ precision on one CPU for arbitrary redshifts and on scales where perturbation theory applies. As an application, we use the nonlinear matter power spectrum from the Dark Sky simulation to assess the performance of the two-loop EFT power spectrum compared to the one-loop EFT power spectrum at $z=0$. We find that, for volumes typical for Stage IV galaxy surveys, $V = 25 \,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$, the two-loop EFT can provide unbiased cosmological constraints on $\Omega_m,H_0$ and $A_s$ using scales up to $k_\text{max}=0.26\, h/\text{Mpc}$, thereby outperforming the constraints from the one-loop EFT ($k_\text{max}=0.11\, h/\text{Mpc}$). The Figure of Merit on these three parameters increases by a factor $\sim 1.9$ and the one-dimensional marginalized constraints improve by $\sim35\%$ for $\Omega_m$, $\sim20\%$ for $H_0$ and $\sim 15\%$ for $A_s$.</description>

      <title>Effective Phantom Divide Crossing with Standard and Negative Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this Letter, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at a $3.27\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dependence of halo properties on central-satellite magnitude gaps through weak lensing measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnitude gap between the central and satellite galaxies encodes information about the mass accretion history of a dark matter halo, and serves as a useful observational probe for the mass distribution in a halo. In this work, we perform the first weak lensing test of the connections between the magnitude gap and the halo profile. We measure the halo profiles of isolated central galaxies (ICGs) selected primarily from the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. Halo mass and concentration are inferred by fitting stacked lensing profiles in bins of central luminosity, $L_\mathrm{c}$, and the central-satellite magnitude gap, $L_\mathrm{gap}$. We detect dependence on the magnitude gap in both halo properties. The dependence is the strongest in the ICG luminosity range of $10^{10.3}&lt;L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot]\leq 10^{10.7}$, where halos with smaller gaps have higher masses and lower concentrations. When $10^{10.7} &lt;L_c[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{11.1}$, however, no significant gap dependence is detected. In the range of $10^{9.9}&lt;L_\mathrm{c}[h^{-2}L_\odot] \leq 10^{10.3}$, a disordering of the gap dependence is marginally observable. We compare the observational results with predictions by two lightcone catalogs built from the Illustris TNG300 and the Millennium simulations. The gap dependence in the two mock samples show overall consistency with observations, but neither matches them in all $L_\mathrm{c}$ bins to a quantitative level. We also compare the significance of the gap dependence on halo mass and concentration and find that our measurement prefers gap dependence in both parameters, while the halo mass dependence is preferred over the concentration if only one of the two dependencies is allowed.</description>

      <title>Forward cascade of large-scale primordial magnetic fields during structure formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of large scale magnetic fields in the Universe is widely thought to be from early Universe processes, like inflation or phase transitions. These magnetic fields evolve via magnetohydrodynamic processes until the epoch of recombination. When structures begin to form in the later Universe, the conservation of magnetic flux amplifies the magnetic fields via the adiabatic collapse of gravitationally bound gas clouds hosting the magnetic fields and moves them to smaller scales. In this work, we have semi-analytically studied this forward cascade effect, considering simple models of gravitational collapse of structures. We find that this simple model is able to reproduce the general qualitative features of the evolution of the magnetic field spectrum as seen from magnetized cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Can cosmic rotation resolve the Hubble tension? Constraints from CMB and large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a relativistic cosmological model with background rotation, sourced by a non-perfect fluid with anisotropic stress. A modified version of the CLASS Boltzmann code is employed to perform MCMC analyses against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and late-time datasets. The results show that current CMB data constrain the present-day rotation parameter to be negligible. As a consequence, the derived cosmological parameters remain consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM values. In contrast, late-time probes such as Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) allow for a higher level of rotation and yield an increased Hubble constant. However, this comes at the cost of a higher $\sigma_8$, which remains in tension with DES-Y3 measurement. Combining CMB, SNe and BAO data confirms the preference for non-rotation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism I: Pure axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF benchmark.</description>

      <title>Dark wounds on icy moons: Ganymede's subsurface ocean as a dark matter detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter in the form of macroscopic composites is largely unconstrained at masses of $\sim 10^{11}- 10^{17}$ g. In this mass range, dark matter may collide with planetary bodies, depositing an immense amount of energy and leaving dramatic surface features that remain detectable on geological timescales. In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon, provides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its differentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark matter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in a large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's conductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface material may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key observable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by dark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of dark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss potential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the Jovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have the ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs of dark matter as well.</description>

      <title>Accretion disc reverberation mapping in a high-redshift quasar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powered by supermassive black holes at their centers, quasars are among the most luminous objects in the Universe, serving as important probes of cosmic history and galaxy evolution. The size of the accretion disc surrounding the black hole is a critical parameter for understanding quasar physics and their potential use as standard candles in cosmology. However, direct measurements of accretion disc sizes have so far been confined to the Local Universe ($z&lt;0.2$), limiting our understanding of quasars during the peak of cosmic activity. Here, we report the first direct measurement of the accretion disc size in the quasar QSO J0455-4216 at $z=2.66$, when the Universe was only $\sim2$ Gyrs old. Medium-band filters mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory were used to isolate continuum emission regions during a six-month monitoring campaign. The light curves exhibit pronounced variability features and enabled the detection of inter-band time delays from different parts of the disc. We mapped the disc and located its ultraviolet-emitting outermost region at $3.02^{+0.33}_{-0.57}$ light-days from the black hole ($\sim 500$ AU). Given a supermassive black hole 900 million times the mass of the Sun, these measurements validate accretion disc theory at an unprecedented redshift and pave the way for efficient black hole mass estimates, reducing decades-long spectroscopic reverberation campaigns to just a few years or less.</description>

      <title>On the gravitational waves from super massive RHNs produced at preheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The post-inflationary production of supermassive particles can have profound implications for the thermal history of the universe and may leave observable imprints in the gravitational wave (GW) background. In scenarios where the inflaton couples predominantly to heavy fields, say right-handed neutrino (RHN), non-perturbative mechanisms such as parametric resonance can lead to their efficient production, even when their masses exceed the inflaton mass. Once produced, the RHNs emit gravitons through bremsstrahlung as they decay into the Standard Model (SM) particles via $N\rightarrow \ell + H$, enabled by the unavoidable minimal coupling to gravity, sourcing a stochastic GW background. We study this mechanism within the framework of $\alpha-$attractor inflationary models, highlighting how the resulting GW spectrum carries indirect imprints of the heavy sector and the post-inflationary dynamics. This offers an observational window into otherwise inaccessible supermassive particles and provides a powerful probe of high-scale physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like LISA and Taiji promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole astrophysics. However, the complex, non-convex likelihood landscapes of EMRI signals (compounded by instrumental noises) have long hindered reliable parameter estimation based on traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which often fail to escape local optima or require impractical computational costs. To address this critical bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering EMRI intrinsic parameters. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC unlocks the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>An Observed Evidence for the Primordial Origin of Galaxy Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an observational evidence supporting the scenario that the protogalactic angular momenta play the most decisive role in molding the optical sizes of present galaxies. Analyzing the NASA-Sloan Atlas catalog in the redshift range of $0.02\le z&lt;0.09$, we observationally determine the probability density distributions, $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$, where $r_{50}$ and $r_{90}$ denote the galaxy sizes enclosing $50\%$ and $90\%$ of their $r$-band luminosities, respectively. Both of the distributions are found to be well described by a bimodal Gamma mixture model, which is consistent with the recent numerical results. Classifying the local galaxies by their ratios, $r_{50}/r_{90}$, we also show that for the case of late-type galaxies with $r_{50}/r_{90}\ge 0.45$ both of $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ exhibit no bimodal feature, following a unimodal Gamma model. Assuming the existence of a linear causal correlation between $\{r_{50},r_{90}\}$ of the late-type galaxies and the primordial spin factor, $\tau$, defined as the degree of misalignments between the initial tidal and protogalaxy inertia tensors, we reconstruct the probability density distributions, $p(\tau)$, directly from the observationally determined $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ of the late-type galaxies, and show excellent agreements with the real distributions of $\tau$ which were determined at the protogalactic stages by numerical experiments. A critical implication of our result on reconstructing the initial conditions from observable galaxy sizes is discussed.</description>

      <title>A sample of giant radio sources from the NVGRC catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for megaparsec-scale sources in the NVGRC catalog of candidates of giant radio source (GRS) based on the NVSS sky survey. We visually inspected 370 NVGRC sources, as well as radio sources falling within a neighborhood of about one square degree around the target object. In the studied sample, 48% of objects were classified as giant radio sources, 14% as sources with a projected linear size of less than 0.72 Mpc, and 38\% as physically unrelated objects combined by the recognition algorithm into one radio source. We identified 197 gaints, of which 72 radio sources are known GRGs or GRQs, and 125 sources were identified by us as GRS for the first time. Comparing the proportion of FRI giants in four redshift bins, we found that for z&lt;0.05, the proportions of FRI and FRII sources were approximately equal, but already at z&gt;0.15 the proportion of FRI giants decreases sharply. The predominance of FRII giants in the GRS lists is most likely due to observational selection due to the sensitivity limit of existing radio surveys. Comparing the NVSS and VLASS cutouts, we found that 33% of sources can be classified as fadded. 25% of the sources show a restart of the radio source phase. 38% of the sources have deformed radio lobes. Our GRS sample includes 74% of galaxies, 15% of IR-excess galaxies, which, according to the WISE photometric data, can be attributed to quasars, and 11% of quasars. When visually examining the optical survey cutouts, we noted the presence of close neighbors for the hosts and/or their belonging to known groups or clusters of galaxies. Close neighbors at a distance of less than 50 kpc were found for 39% of radio sources, and 28% of sources are part of groups or clusters of galaxies. Thus, about 70% of gaints are in a fairly dense environment, and this proportion may be higher.</description>

      <title>The X-ray$-$UV Luminosity Relation of eROSITA Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has been studied for decades. However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.</description>

      <title>A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{\rm b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{\rm b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshift $z\sim 10-20$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH--DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining high-$z$ sources such as Little Red Dots, and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin, bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.</description>

      <title>Testing f (R) gravity models with DESI-BAO and other cosmological data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a statistical analysis of various cosmological models within the framework of f (R) gravity theories, motivated by persistent challenges in modern cosmology, such as the unknown mechanisms driving the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. We begin by presenting a comprehensive formulation of these theories and discussing their potential to resolve the outstanding issues. Following this, we perform a detailed statistical examination in a cosmological context, leveraging a wide array of observational data. Special attention is given to the incorporation of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and of the Pantheon++SH0ES compilation, which play a critical role in constraining these models. Our results show an increase in the values of the distortion parameter b and of the Hubble parameter H0 estimates, due to the use of this new compilation of SnIa data. However, no major changes are perceived when using the DESI data set instead of the previous BAO observations.</description>

      <title>Comparison of dynamical dark energy with {\Lambda}CDM in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state, $w(a)$, using the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data in combination with Pantheon+ and DES5Y Type Ia supernovae measurements, respectively. Building on our previous analysis in arXiv:2503.08658, which employed a nonparametric flexknot reconstruction approach, we examine whether the evidence for dynamical dark energy persists with the improved precision of the DESI DR2 dataset. We find that while the overall qualitative structure of $w(a)$ remains consistent with our earlier findings, the statistical support for dynamical dark energy is reduced when considering DESI DR2 data alone, particularly for more complex flexknot models with higher numbers of knots. However, the evidence for simpler dynamical models, such as $w$CDM and CPL (which correspond to $n=1$ and $n=2$ knots respectively), increases relative to $\Lambda$CDM with DESI DR2 alone, with CPL being the preferred dynamical model, consistent with previous DESI analyses. When combined with Pantheon+ data, the conclusions remain broadly consistent with our earlier work, but when instead combined with DES5Y supernovae data, there is an increased preference for flexknot models for all values of $n$ considered. This results in all such models being preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, with the CPL model being the most favoured by a Bayes factor of $\sim 2.3$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmic Birefringence and DESI Data with Evolving Axion in $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Do Pulsar Timing Datasets Favor Massive Gravity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several observational phenomena suggest that the standard model of cosmology and particle physics requires revision. To address this, we consider the extension of general relativity known as massive gravity (MG). In this Letter, we explore the imprints of MG on the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs): their modified dispersion relation and their additional (two vector and one scalar) polarization modes on the stochastic GW background (SGWB) detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We analyze the effects of massive GWs on the Hellings-Downs curve induced by modification of the overlap reduction function. Our study consists of analyzing observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the Chinese PTA Data Release I, and is independent of the origin of the SGWB (astrophysical or cosmological). By considering the bound on the graviton mass imposed through the dispersion relation, we scrutinize the possibility of detecting traces of MG in the PTA observational data. We find that massive GWs predict better fits for the observed pulsar correlations. Future PTA missions with more precise data will hopefully be able to detect the GW additional polarization modes and might be effectively used to constrain the graviton mass.</description>

      <title>The formation and disruption of globular cluster populations in simulations of present-day $L^\ast$ galaxies with controlled assembly histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are sensitive tracers of galaxy assembly histories but interpreting the information they encode is challenging because mergers are thought to promote both the formation and disruption of GCs. We use simulations with controlled merger histories to examine the influence of merger mass ratio on the GC population of a present-day $L^\ast$ galaxy, using the genetic modification technique to adjust the initial conditions of a galaxy that experiences major mergers at $z = 1.7$ and $0.77$ (ORGANIC case), so the later merger has twice its original mass ratio (ENHANCED case), or is prevented from occurring (SUPPRESSED case). We evolve the three realizations with E-MOSAICS (MOdelling Star cluster population Assembly In Cosmological Simulations with EAGLE), which couples subgrid star cluster formation and evolution models to the EAGLE (Evolution and assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) galaxy formation model. Relative to the ORGANIC case, the mass of surviving GCs is elevated (reduced) in the ENHANCED (SUPPRESSED) case, indicating that major mergers promote a net boost to the GC population. The boost is clearly quantified by the GC specific mass because it is sensitive to the number of the most massive GCs, whose long characteristic disruption time-scales enable them to survive their hostile natal environments. In contrast, the specific frequency is insensitive to assembly history because it primarily traces low-mass GCs that tend to be disrupted soon after their formation. The promotion of GC formation and disruption by major mergers imprints a lasting and potentially observable signature: an elevated mass fraction of field stars in the galaxy's stellar halo that were born in star clusters.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions that lie between the web of galaxies, filaments and walls, and are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out over-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block cells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void structures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's spatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed points around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's performance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio M\"ah\"onen method to the same test dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their luminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features such as sphericity. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological scalar fields coupled to the Standard Model drive temporal variations in the fundamental constants that grow with redshift, positioning the early Universe as a powerful tool to study such models. We investigate the dynamics and phenomenology of coupled scalars from the early Universe to the present to consistently leverage the myriad searches for time-varying constants and the cosmological signatures of scalars' gravitational effects. We compute the in-medium contribution from Standard Model particles to the scalar's dynamics and identify only a limited range of couplings for which the scalar has an observable impact on the fundamental constants without either evolving before recombination or gravitating nonnegligibly. We then extend existing laboratory and astrophysical bounds to the hyperlight scalar regime. We present joint limits from the early and late Universe, specializing to hyperlight, quadratically coupled scalars that modulate the mass of the electron or the strength of electromagnetism and make up a subcomponent of the dark matter today. Our dedicated analysis of observations of the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae provides the most stringent constraints on quadratically coupled scalars with masses from $10^{-28.5}$ to $\sim 10^{-31}~\mathrm{eV}$, below which quasar absorption spectra yield stronger bounds. These results jointly limit hyperlight scalars that comprise a few percent of the current dark matter density to near- or subgravitational couplings to electrons or photons.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently announced the detection of a neutrino with energy 220 PeV. One possible source of such ultra-high-energy particles is the rapid emission of energetic Hawking radiation from a primordial black hole (PBH) near the end of its evaporation lifetime. The mass distribution for PBHs features a power-law tail for small masses; a small subset of PBHs would be undergoing late-stage evaporation today. We find that recent high-energy neutrino events detected by the IceCube and KM3NeT Collaborations, with energies ${\cal O} (1 - 10^2) \, {\rm PeV}$, are consistent with event-rate expectations if a significant fraction of the dark matter consists of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Little Red Dots from the Core-collapse of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23710v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical study of black hole (BH) formation and growth seeded by gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos at high redshift, using a cosmological semi-analytical framework based on Monte Carlo merger trees. We demonstrate that gravothermal collapse naturally leads to BH formation in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass scale set by the SIDM cross section, and occurs predominantly in the early Universe. This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of the little red dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process with simple models of BH growth and assuming a 100% duty cycle, we reproduce the observed LRD mass function for velocity-dependent cross sections of $\sigma_{0m} \sim 30\,\mathrm{cm}^2\,\mathrm{g}^{-1}$ and $\omega \sim 80\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which are consistent with independent constraints from local galaxies. While higher values of $\sigma_{0m}$ (or $\omega$) would overpredict the low-mass (or high-mass) end of the BH mass function, such deviations could be reconciled by invoking a reduced duty cycle or lower Eddington ratio. Our results suggest that the demographics of high-redshift BHs can serve as a novel and complementary probe of SIDM physics.</description>

      <title>How Many Times Should We Matched Filter Gravitational Wave Data? A Comparison of GstLAL's Online and Offline Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences employ a process called matched filtering, in which gravitational wave strain data is cross-correlated against a bank of waveform templates. Data from every observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration is typically analyzed in this way twice, first in a low-latency mode in which gravitational wave candidates are identified in near-real time, and later in a high-latency mode. Such high-latency analyses have traditionally been considered more sensitive, since background data from the full observing run is available for assigning significance to all candidates, as well as more robust, since they do not need to worry about keeping up with live data. In this work, we present a novel technique to use the matched filtering data products from a low-latency analysis and re-process them by assigning significances in a high-latency way, effectively removing the need to perform matched filtering a second time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we analyze 38 days of LIGO and Virgo data from the third observing run (O3) using the GstLAL pipeline, and show that our method is as sensitive and reliable as a traditional high-latency analysis. Since matched filtering represents the vast majority of computing time for a traditional analysis, our method greatly reduces the time and computational burden required to produce the same results as a traditional high-latency analysis. Consequently, it has already been adopted by GstLAL for the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Extensive and Intensive Aspects of Astrophysical Systems and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most astrophysical systems in our Universe are characterized by shallow gravitational potentials, with dimensionless compactness $|\Phi| \equiv r_s / R \ll 1$, where $r_{s}$ and $R$ are their Schwarzschild radius and typical size, respectively. While the existence and characteristic scales of such virialized systems depend on gravity, we demonstrate that the value of $|\Phi|$ -- and thus the non-relativistic nature of most astrophysical objects -- arises from microphysical parameters, specifically the fine structure constant and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and is fundamentally independent of the gravitational constant $G$. It then follows that peak rms values of large-scale astrophysical velocities and escape velocities associated with naturally formed astrophysical systems are determined by electromagnetic and atomic physics, not by gravitation, and that the compactness $|\Phi|$ is always set by microphysical scales -- even for the most compact objects, such as neutron stars, where $|\Phi|$ is determined by quantities like the pion-to-proton mass ratio. Our results emphasize the central but underappreciated role played by dimensionless microphysical constants in shaping the macroscopic gravitational landscape of the Universe. In particular, we clarify that this independence of the compactness $|\Phi|$ from $G$ applies specifically to entire, virialized or degeneracy pressure-supported systems, naturally formed astrophysical systems -- such as stars, galaxies, and planets -- that have reached equilibrium between self-gravity and microphysical processes. Finally, we point out that a clear distinction between intensive and extensive astrophysical/cosmological properties could potentially shed a new light on the mass hierarchy and the cosmological constant problems; both may be related to the large complexity of our Universe.

      <title>Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. By providing an analytical expression, even if it is mathematically redundant, we believe that $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ will be studied across a broader range of WI models in the future. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</description>
