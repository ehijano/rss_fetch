      <title>Stress Engineering of Thermal Fluctuation of Magnetization and Noise Spectra in Low Barrier Nanomagnets Used as Analog and Binary Stochastic Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single-domain nanomagnet, shaped like a thin elliptical disk with small eccentricity, has a double well potential profile with two degenerate energy minima separated by a small barrier of a few kT (k = Boltzmann constant and T = absolute temperature). The two minima correspond to the magnetization pointing along the two mutually anti-parallel directions along the major axis. At room temperature, the magnetization fluctuates between the two minima mimicking telegraph noise. This makes the nanomagnet act as a "binary" stochastic neuron (BSN) with the neuronal state encoded in the magnetization orientation. If the nanomagnet is magnetostrictive, then the barrier can be depressed further by applying (electrically generated) uniaxial stress along the ellipse's major axis, thereby gradually eroding the double well shape. When the barrier almost vanishes, the magnetization begins to randomly assume any arbitrary orientation (not just along the major axis), making the nanomagnet act as an "analog" stochastic neuron (ASN). The magnetization fluctuation then begins to increasingly resemble white noise. The full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the noise auto-correlation function decreases with increasing stress, as the fluctuation gradually transforms from telegraph noise to white noise. The noise spectral density exhibits a 1/f^(beta) spectrum (at high frequencies) with "beta" decreasing with increasing stress, which is again characteristic of the transition from telegraph to white noise. Stress can thus not only reconfigure a BSN to an ASN, which has its own applications, but it can also perform "noise engineering", i.e., tune the auto-correlation function and power spectral density. That can have applications in signal processing.</description>

      <title>Theory of electric polarization induced by magnon transport in two-dimensional honeycomb antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum mechanical formalism for computing the electric polarization arising in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets (AFMs) as a result of {\bf both} spin and orbital transport effect of magnons. We first show that an applied temperature gradient in a 2D collinear honeycomb AFM gives rise to accumulations of magnons having both orbital moment and spin moment at the edges of the 2D AFM as the manifestation of the magnon Nernst effects. We then use our formalism to show that such magnon Nernst effects, in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI), induce electric polarization that can be measured experimentally. Finally, we demonstrate the value of this formalism by using it to predict the properties of two 2D honeycomb AFMs, one each with N\'eel and zigzag order. These results integrate advances in magnonics, spinorbitronics, and orbitronics to create a unified framework that can be used to understand and control the manipulation of magnetic states in 2D AFMs through the magnon spin and orbital degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Increased Gilbert damping in Yttrium Iron Garnet by low temperature vacuum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of thermal surface cleaning on the Gilbert damping, $\alpha$, of yttrium iron garnet (YIG), before capping with a metallic layer, has been investigated. Our results show that $\alpha$ is strongly effected by relatively mild annealing conditions (T = 300 C) when performed in a vacuum. This increase needs to be taken into account when obtaining the spin mixing conductance from spin pumping measurements. We measure an increase in $\alpha$ by a factor of 8 when the YIG is vacuum annealed at 300 C. No such changes in $\alpha$ are observed when annealed at the same temperature in 0.1 mbar of oxygen.</description>

      <title>Magnetochiral anisotropy on a quantum spin Hall edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of nonlinear low-magnetic-field magnetotransport on a helical edge of a quantum spin Hall insulator due to the edge state coupling to bulk midgap states. We focus on the part of the nonlinear I-V characteristic that is odd in the applied magnetic field, and quadratic in the applied bias voltage. This part of the I-V characteristic corresponds to the resistance of the sample being dependent on the relative orientation of the current and an external magnetic field, hence represents a type of edge magnetochiral anisotropy. We identify two mechanisms of the magnetochiral anisotropy. One is related to the Hubbard interaction on the midgap state, which leads to the dependence of the scattering characteristics on the current flowing on the edge, which results in bias-voltage-dependent resistance, or equivalently conductance, hence a nonlinear I-V. The other is related to the modification of the edge dispersion by a magnetic field, and requires nonlinearity in the edge dispersion. We compare the developed theory to the experiments on monolayer $\mathrm{WTe}_{2}$, and find good agreement with the developed theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Generation and Stabilization by Coherent Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision is a useful tool for revealing quantum effects and realizing quantum informational tasks. We demonstrate that repeated collisions by itinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an entangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange with either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with proper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most collision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for the two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled state. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists in the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the decoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using single-electron sources.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in magic-strain graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive investigations on the Moir\'e magic-angle have been conducted in twisted bilayer graphene, unlocking the mystery of unconventional superconductivity and insulating states. In analog to magic angle, here we demonstrate the new concept of magic-strain in graphene systems by judiciously tailoring mechanical relaxation (stretch and compression) which is easier to implement in practice. We elucidate the interplay of strain-induced effects and delve into the resulting unconventional superconductivity or semimetal-insulator transition in relaxation-strained graphene, going beyond the traditional twisting approach. Our findings reveal how relaxation strain can trigger superconducting transitions (with an ultra-flat band at the Fermi level) or the semimetal-insulator transition (with a gap opening at the $K$ point of $0.39\rm{~eV}$) in both monolayer and bilayer graphene. These discoveries open up a new branch for correlated phenomena and provide deeper insights into the underlying physics of superconductors, which positions graphene as a highly tunable platform for novel electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Origin of interlayer exciton-phonon coupling in 2D heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between excitons and phonons across adjacent layers has been experimentally observed in various heterostructures of layered materials. Yet the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains elusive. Using the WSe$_2$@hBN heterostructure as an example, we study the origin of the interlayer exciton-phonon coupling and its signature in resonant Raman scattering through first-principles calculations. Our study emphasizes the central role of crystal symmetries in the interlayer exciton-phonon scattering processes, which are responsible for the anomalous resonant Raman intensities of the in-plane and the out-of-plane hBN phonon modes. We find that the deformation potential induced by the hBN phonon interacts with the hybridized hole density of WSe$_2$ excitons near the hBN interface, leading to interlayer exciton-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Engineering high Chern number insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Chern insulators is one of the most important buliding block of topological physics, enabling the quantum Hall effect without external magnetic fields. The construction of Chern insulators has been typically through an guess-and-confirm approach, which can be inefficient and unpredictable. In this paper, we introduce a systematic method to directly construct two-dimensional Chern insulators that can provide any nontrivial Chern number. Our method is built upon the one-dimensional Rice-Mele model, which is well known for its adjustable polarization properties, providing a reliable framework for manipulation. By extending this model into two dimensions, we are able to engineer lattice structures that demonstrate predetermined topological quantities effectively. This research not only contributes the development of Chern insulators but also paves the way for designing a variety of lattice structures with significant topological implications, potentially impacting quantum computing and materials science. With this approach, we are to shed light on the pathways for designing more complex and functional topological phases in synthetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review is devoted to the different techniques that have been developed to compute the coherent transport properties of quantum nanoelectronic systems connected to electrodes. Beside a review of the different algorithms proposed in the literature, we provide a comprehensive and pedagogical derivation of the two formalisms on which these techniques are based: the scattering approach and the Green's function approach. We show that the scattering problem can be formulated as a system of linear equations and that different existing algorithms for solving this scattering problem amount to different sequences of Gaussian elimination. We explicitly prove the equivalence of the two formalisms. We discuss the stability and numerical complexity of the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Lasing of Quantum-Dot Micropillar Lasers under Elevated Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive numerical modelling of microcavity parameters for micropillar lasers with optical pumping was presented. The structure with a hybrid dielectric-semiconductor top mirror has a significantly higher calculated quality-factor (~65000 for 5 $\mu$m pillar) due to better vertical mode confinement. The minimum laser threshold (~370 $\mu$W for 5 $\mu$m pillar) coincided with a temperature of 130 K, which is close to zero gain to cavity detuning. Lasing up to 220 K was demonstrated with a laser threshold of about 2.2 mW.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of the [110] SnTe nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SnTe materials are know to be a platform for realization of various strong and symmetry protected topological phases in one, two and three spatial dimensions. We study symmetry-protected topological states in $[110]$ SnTe nanowires in the presence of various combinations of Zeeman field, $s-$wave superconductivity, inversion-symmetry-breaking field and the thickness of the wire. In the normal state we find a Weyl semimetal phase protected by a twofold screw axis symmetry and a topological insulating phase characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant protected by a mirror symmetry. In the presence of superconductivity, we find inversion-symmetry-protected gapless phase which becomes fully gapped and topologically non-trivial by introducing an inversion-symmetry-breaking field. Consequently, we find topologically protected localized Majorana zero modes appear at the ends of the wire. We find that this Majorana phase is much easier to achieve in a $[110]$ SnTe nanowire than in a $[001]$ one.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signatures of Topological Superconductivity in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions provide a platform to host topological superconductivity which, through manipulating Majorana bound states (MBS), could enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, what constitutes experimental signatures of topological superconductivity and how MBS can be detected remains strongly debated. In addition to spurious effects that mimic MBS, there is a challenge to discern the inherent topological signals in realistic systems with many topologically-trivial Andreev bound states, determining the transport properties of Josephson junctions. Guided by the advances in microwave spectroscopy, we theoretically study Al/InAs-based planar Josephson junction embedded into a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device to identify microwave signatures of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, by exploring the closing and reopening of a topological gap, we show that even in a wide planar Josephson junction with many Andreev bound states, such a topological signature is distinguishable in the resonance frequency shift of a microwave drive and the ``half-slope'' feature of the microwave absorption spectrum. Our findings provide an important step towards experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics and implementing scalable topological quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear screening in periodically doped Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The screening problem for Coulomb potential of a charge located in a two-dimensional system has an intriguing solution with power-law screening factor decreasing with distance, which is crucially different from a 3D case with common exponential screening law. This stems from the outplane electrical fields leading to the long-range action on charge distribution. An effective screening length controlling the power law of potential drop far from the charge depends on material parameters of a 2D semiconductor, although it does not prevent from electron flooding of low-doped regions of a heterostructure. In Graphene and other materials with linear energy spectrum for electrons this flooding effects also occur, but the effective screening length is doping-level-dependent now. We built the theory for electronic potential and electrons concentration in a 1D-periodically doped Graphene sheet taking into account all effects of a long-range 2D screening and linear spectrum influence. We show that due to linear spectrum such problem results in a substantially nonlinear integro-differential equation, which can be solved numerically. Similar nonlinear problems arise in a wide range of doped structures using 2D linear spectrum materials.</description>

Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at avoided crossing near exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <title>Residue imaginary velocity induces many-body delocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization and delocalization are historic topics central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. Interestingly, a disorder field contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may allow strong-disorder-limit delocalization when $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ prevails over the Anderson localization. We demonstrate such delocalization with correlation and entanglement behaviors, as well as its many-body nature and generalizability to finite temperatures and interactions. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and breeds useful applications, e.g., in quantum adiabatic processes.</description>

Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in nuclear-spin transitions of $^{14}$N within nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond. It is shown that the STIRAP technique suppresses the occupation of the intermediate state, which is a crucial factor for improvements in quantum sensing technology. Building on that advantage, we develop and implement a generalized version of the Ramsey interferometric scheme, employing half-STIRAP pulses to perform the necessary quantum-state manipulation with high fidelity. The enhanced robustness of the STIRAP-based Ramsey scheme to variations in the pulse parameters is experimentally demonstrated, showing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results pave the way for improving the long-term stability of diamond-based sensors, such as gyroscopes and frequency standards.</description>

      <title>Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology in active matter</title>

Abstract: Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.</description>

      <title>Self-Reasoning Assistant Learning for non-Abelian Gauge Fields Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian braiding has attracted substantial attention because of its pivotal role in describing the exchange behaviour of anyons, in which the input and outcome of non-Abelian braiding are connected by a unitary matrix. Implementing braiding in a classical system can assist the experimental investigation of non-Abelian physics. However, the design of non-Abelian gauge fields faces numerous challenges stemmed from the intricate interplay of group structures, Lie algebra properties, representation theory, topology, and symmetry breaking. The extreme diversity makes it a powerful tool for the study of condensed matter physics. Whereas the widely used artificial intelligence with data-driven approaches has greatly promoted the development of physics, most works are limited on the data-to-data design. Here we propose a self-reasoning assistant learning framework capable of directly generating non-Abelian gauge fields. This framework utilizes the forward diffusion process to capture and reproduce the complex patterns and details inherent in the target distribution through continuous transformation. Then the reverse diffusion process is used to make the generated data closer to the distribution of the original situation. Thus, it owns strong self-reasoning capabilities, allowing to automatically discover the feature representation and capture more subtle relationships from the dataset. Moreover, the self-reasoning eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and simplifies the process of model building. Our framework offers a disruptive paradigm shift to parse complex physical processes, automatically uncovering patterns from massive datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing complex experimental data with multiple parameters is challenging. We propose using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an effective solution. This method, demonstrated through real experimental data analysis, surpasses conventional approaches in understanding complex physics data. Singular values and vectors distinguish and highlight various physical mechanisms and scales, revealing previously challenging elements. SVD emerges as a powerful tool for navigating complex experimental landscapes, showing promise for diverse experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>When Knots are Plectonemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of DNA polymers through nanoscale pores is central to many biological processes, from bacterial gene exchange to viral infection. In single-molecule nanopore sensing, the detection of nucleic acid and protein analytes relies on the passage of a long biopolymer through a nanoscale aperture. Understanding the dynamics of polymer translocation through nanopores, especially the relation between ionic current signal and polymer conformations is thus essential for the successful identification of targets. Here, by analyzing ionic current traces of dsDNA translocation, we reveal that features up to now uniquely associated with knots are instead different structural motifs: plectonemes. By combining experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that such plectonemes form because of the solvent flow that induces rotation of the helical DNA fragment in the nanopore, causing torsion propagation outwards from the pore. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that plectoneme initialization is dominated by the applied torque while the translocation time and size of the plectonemes depend on the coupling of torque and pulling force, a mechanism that might also be relevant for in vivo DNA organization. Experiments with nicked DNA constructs show that the number of plectonemes depends on the rotational constraints of the translocating molecules. Thus, our work introduces plectonemes as essential structural features that must be considered for accurate analysis of polymer transport in the nanopore.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Control of Ordering Kinetics and Vacancy Behavior in Fe-Al Thin Films Quenched by Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of issues arising in materials science is a behavior of non-equilibrium point defects in the atomic lattice, which defines the rates of chemical reactions and relaxation processes as well as affects the physical properties of solids. It was previously predicted that melting and rapid solidification of metals and alloys provides a vacancy concentration in the quenched material, which can be comparable to that quantity at the point of melting. Here, we experimentally explore the vacancy behavior in thin films of the quasi-equiatomic Fe-Al alloy subjected to nanosecond laser annealing with intensities up to film ablation. The effects of laser irradiation are studied by monitoring magneto-optically the ordering kinetics in the alloy at the very ablation edge, within a narrow (micron-scale) ring-shaped region around the ablation zone. Quantitatively, the vacancy supersaturation in the quenched alloy has been estimated by fitting a simulated temporal evolution of the long-range chemical order to the obtained experimental data. Laser quenching (LQ) of alloys and single-element materials would be a tool for obtaining novel phase states within a small volume of the crystal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of fast and efficient quantum batteries is crucial for the prospects of quantum technologies. We show that both requirements are accomplished in the paradigmatic model of a harmonic oscillator strongly coupled to a highly non-Markovian thermal reservoir. At short times, a dynamical blockade of the reservoir prevents the leakage of energy towards its degrees of freedom, promoting a significant accumulation of energy in the battery with high efficiency. The possibility of implementing these conditions in $LC$ quantum circuits opens up new avenues for solid-state quantum batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonics has been revolutionized by breakthroughs in optical metasurfaces and layered two-dimensional materials. Yet, integrating these two fields in a singular system has remained challenging. Here, we introduce the concept of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure metasurfaces, where ultrathin multilayer vdW material stacks are shaped into precisely engineered resonant nanostructures for boosting light-matter interactions. By leveraging quasi-bound states in the continuum to create intrinsic cavities from WS$_2$ monolayers encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride, we observe room-temperature strong coupling and polaritonic luminescence, which further unveils a saturation of the strong-coupling regime at ultralow fluences &lt;1 nJ/cm2, more than three orders of magnitude smaller than in previous 2D-cavity systems. Our approach, seamlessly merging metasurfaces and vdW materials, unlocks new avenues for ultrathin optical devices with atomic-scale precision and control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the transition rates, dephasing rates, and Lamb shifts for a system consisting of many molecules collectively coupled to a resonant cavity mode. Using a variational polaron master equation, we show that strong vibrational interactions inherent to molecules give rise to multi phonon processes and suppress the light--matter coupling. In the strong light--matter coupling limit, multi-phonon contributions to the transition and dephasing rates strongly dominate over single phonon contributions for typical molecular parameters. This leads to novel dependencies of the rates and spectral line widths on the number of molecules in the cavity. We also find that vibrational Lamb shifts can substantially modify the polariton energies in the strong light--matter coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topology and bulk-boundary correspondence in a two-dimensional SSH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the 1D SSH chain into two dimensions using inter-chain hopping $t$ with two specific pairs of edges produced with two different atoms. The extension retains all of the 1D SSH model's symmetries on the global level. We discovered that when individual SSH chains are in a non-trivial topological phase and introduce a staggering amplitude between chains with a scenario $t&lt; v+w/2$, the system exhibits four zero energy modes that are confined to two of the four corners of the system. Interestingly, two out of the four zero modes are found to be associated with trimmers. No zero energy modes arise when the chains are in the trivial topological phase with $t&lt; v+w/2$. Further with a critical look at the phase evolution of the Bloch states of the system we identified a set of closed paths to define a winding number to characterize the topological nature of the system. The Bulk-Corner correspondence is established by calculating the winding number, varying between 2 and 1 in non-trivial topological phase and found to be 0 in the trivial topological phase. Based of this study we characterize the system with four localized corner modes and a bulk winding number 2 appears to be a Second-order topological insulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials with Janus structure host novel physical properties due to their inversional symmetry breaking. However, it remains elusive to synthesize Janus monolayer crystals with tailored long-range magnetic orders. Here, we have developed a general method to fabricate uniform Janus CrTeSe monolayers by selective selenization of preformed CrTe2 monolayers with molecular beam epitaxy. The uniform Janus structure of CrTeSe with high crystal quality is confirmed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements unveil that the Janus CrTeSe undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) transition and a robust antiferromagnetic order. The magnetic anisotropy of CrTeSe is drastically altered compared to monolayer CrTe2 by the breaking symmetries induced from the Janus structure and the CDW transition, as is substantiated with first principles calculations. Our research achieves the construction of large-area Janus structures, and artificially tailors the electronic and magnetic properties of Janus systems at the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Water Behavior and Its Impact on Adsorption: A case study with CNTs and Diclofenac</title>

Abstract: Water is a fundamental component of life, playing a critical role in regulating metabolic processes and facilitating the dissolution and transport of essential molecules. However, the presence of emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, poses significant challenges to water quality and safety. Nanomaterials-based technologies arise as a promising tool to remove those contaminants from water. Nevertheless, interfacial water plays a major role in the adsorption of chemical compounds in the nanomaterials - as it plays in biological processes such as protein folding, enzyme activity, and drug delivery. To understand this role, in this study we employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the adsorption dynamics of potassium diclofenac (K-DCF) on single-walled (SWCNT) and double-walled (DWCNT) carbon nanotubes, considering both dry and wet conditions. Our findings reveal that the structuring of water molecules around CNTs creates hydration layers that significantly influence the accessibility of active sites and the interaction strength between contaminants and adsorbents. Our analysis indicates higher energy barriers for adsorption in DWCNTs compared to SWCNTs, which is attributed to stronger water-surface interactions. This research highlights the importance of understanding nanoscale water behavior for optimizing the design and functionality of nanomaterials for water purification. These findings can guide the development of more efficient and selective nanomaterials, enhancing contaminant removal and ensuring safer water resources, while also contributing to a deeper understanding of fundamental biological interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions in many-body systems are often associated with the emergence of spatial inhomogeneities. Such features may develop at microscopic lengthscales and are not necessarily evident in measurements of macroscopic quantities. In this work, we address the topic of distribution of current paths in superconducting films. Typical lengthscales associated with superconductivity are in the range of nanometres. Accordingly, measurements of electrical resistance over much larger distances are supposed to be insensitive to details of spatial inhomogeneities of electronic properties. We observe that, contrary to expectations, current paths adopt a highly non-uniform distribution at the onset of the superconducting transition which is manifested in the development of a finite transverse resistance. The anisotropic distribution of current density is unrelated to the structural properties of the superconducting films, and indicates the emergence of electronic inhomogeneities perceivable over macroscopic distances. Our experiments reveal the ubiquitous nature of this phenomenon in conventional superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional insulator, when subjected to an external superlattice potential forms a new paradigm for electrostatically tunable excitons in the near- and mid-ultraviolet (UV). The imposed potential has three consequences: (i) it renormalizes the effective mass tensor, leading to anisotropic effective masses; (ii) it renormalizes the band gap, eventually reducing it; (iii) it reduces the exciton binding energies. All these consequences depend on a single dimensionless parameter, which includes the product of strength of the external potential with its period. In addition to the excitonic energy levels, we compute the optical conductivity along two orthogonal directions, and from it the absorption spectrum. The results for the latter show that our system is able to mimic a grid polarizer. These characteristics make one-dimensional hBN superlattices a viable and unexplored platform for fine-tuned polaritonics in the UV to visible spectral range.</description>

Abstract: Macroscopic-scale nanostructures, situated at the interface of nanostructures and bulk materials, hold significant promise in the realm of thermoelectric materials. Nanostructuring presents a compelling avenue for enhancing material thermoelectric performance as well as unlocking intriguing nanoscale phenomena, including spin-dependent thermoelectric effects. This is achieved while preserving high power output capabilities and ease of measurements related to the overall macroscopic dimensions. Within this framework, the recently developed three-dimensional interconnected nanowire and nanotube networks, integrated into a flexible polymer membrane, emerge as promising candidates for macroscopic nanostructures. The flexibility of these composites also paves the way for advances in the burgeoning field of flexible thermoelectrics. In this study, we demonstrate that the three-dimensional nanowire networks made of ferromagnetic metals maintain the intrinsic bulk thermoelectric power of their bulk constituent even for a diameter reduced to approximately 23 nm. Furthermore, we showcase the pioneering magneto-thermoelectric measurements of three-dimensional interconnected nickel nanotube networks. These macroscopic materials, comprising interconnected nanotubes, enable the development of large-area devices that exhibit efficient thermoelectric performance, while their nanoscale tubular structures provide distinctive magneto-transport properties. This research represents a significant step toward harnessing the potential of macroscopic nanostructured materials in the field of thermoelectrics.</description>

Abstract: The coherent control of interacting spins in semiconductor quantum dots is of strong interest for quantum information processing as well as for studying quantum magnetism from the bottom up. Here, we present a $2\times4$ germanium quantum dot array with full and controllable interactions between nearest-neighbor spins. As a demonstration of the level of control, we define four singlet-triplet qubits in this system and show two-axis single-qubit control of each qubit and SWAP-style two-qubit gates between all neighbouring qubit pairs, yielding average single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.49(8)-99.84(1)% and Bell state fidelities of 73(1)-90(1)%. Combining these operations, we experimentally implement a circuit designed to generate and distribute entanglement across the array. A remote Bell state with a fidelity of 75(2)% and concurrence of 22(4)% is achieved. These results highlight the potential of singlet-triplet qubits as a competing platform for quantum computing and indicate that scaling up the control of quantum dot spins in extended bilinear arrays can be feasible.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic response and anisotropic hydrodynamics in Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study viscoelastic response in Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry. The principal finding is that topology and anisotropy of the Fermi surface are manifested in the viscoelasticity tensor of the electron fluid. In the dynamic (interband) part of this tensor, the anisotropy leads to a qualitatively different, compared with isotropic models, scaling with frequency and the Fermi energy. The components of the viscosity tensor determined by the Fermi-surface properties agree in the Kubo and kinetic formalisms; the latter, however, misses the anomalous Hall viscosity originating from filled states below the Fermi surface. The anisotropy of the dispersion relation is also manifested in the acceleration and relaxation terms of the hydrodynamic equations providing means to probe the anisotropy in transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Helical trilayer graphene in magnetic field: Chern mosaic and higher Chern number ideal flat bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Helical trilayer graphene (hTG) exhibits a supermoir\'e pattern with large domains centered around stacking points ABA and BAB, where two well-separated low-energy bands appear with different total Chern numbers at each valley, forming a Chern mosaic pattern. In the chiral limit, the low-energy bands become exactly flat at zero energy for magic-angle twists. Here we investigate these zero-energy flat bands and their topological properties in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. We show that hTG retains the precise flatness of the zero-energy bands, even at finite magnetic fields. We find topological phase transitions at fields corresponding to unit and half magnetic flux leading to an emergence of higher Chern number flat bands. Consequently the Chern mosaic gets modified for finite magnetic fields. We further find the analytical forms of zero-energy wave functions and identify a set of hidden wave functions, which gives crucial insights into both the topological transitions and enhancement of Chern numbers across them. We also find topological transitions away from the chiral limit with finite corrugations and at different magic angles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Schwinger effect and non-perturbative light detection in lead halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dielectric breakdown of physical vacuum (Schwinger effect) is the textbook demonstration of compatibility of Relativity and Quantum theory. Although, the observation of this effect in its original static formulation is practically unachievable, it has been shown that the requirements on field strengths can be significantly reduced for dynamical generalizations of Schwinger effect. Here, we report on observation of an analog dynamical Schwinger effect in gapped Dirac semiconductor lead-halide perovskite MAPbBr$_3$. Specifically, we observe strong photoluminescence of a lead-halide perovskite driven by deep sub-gap irradiation, and use the quasi-adiabatic Landau-Dykhne approach to interpret our data in terms of the dynamical Schwinger effect. Further, the exponential sensitivity of the Schwinger effect to driving fields allows us to measure the local frozen-in fields in a nominally cubic single perovskite crystal at room temperature. Finally, we demonstrate an AC analogue of biasing in our system -- the non-perturbative cooperation between two time-dependent fields simultaneously driving the sample. Our results establish lead-halide perovskites as an excellent platform for simulating effects of strong fields on Dirac fields. In addition, they contribute to the on-going discussion about inversion-breaking in MAPbBr$_3$ single crystal and pave the way for a mid-infrared light detection with lead-halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Coulomb drag by motion of a monolayer polar crystal through graphene nano-constriction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict theoretically that the motion of a polar crystalline layer between two graphene planes exerts Coulomb drag on electrons in graphene, inducing a DC-drag current. The physical mechanism of this drag relies on the intervalley scattering of charge carriers in graphene by the time-dependent potential of the moving crystalline layer. The drag current exhibits a nonlinear Hall effect, which can be used for the experimental measurement of the Berry curvature. In turn, the drag of electrons in graphene exerts a back-action on the crystalline layer, which can be expressed in terms of increased dynamic viscosity.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a room temperature, all-electric device that reaches a strong coupling regime where external environmental coupling dominates over internal mechanical dissipation. The device has four orders of magnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal, and achieves a position imprecision rivaling an optical interferometer. With the help of a back-action isolation scheme, we observe radiative cooling of mechanical motion by a remote cryogenic load.</description>

      <title>Reduction for one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in the relativistic quantum field theories at finite temperature and/or finite density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.11314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{conventional} Passarino-Veltman reduction is a systematic procedure based on the Lorentz covariance, which can efficiently reduce the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in the relativistic quantum field theories (QFTs) at zero temperature and zero density. However, the Lorentz covariance is explicitly broken when either of the temperature and density is finite, due to a rest reference frame of the many-body system in which the temperature and density are measured, rendering the \emph{conventional} Passarino-Veltman reduction not applicable anymore to reduce the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals therein. In this paper, we report a \emph{generalized} Passarino-Veltman reduction which can efficiently simplify the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in the relativistic QFTs at finite temperature and/or finite density. The \emph{generalized} Passarino-Veltman reduction can analyze the one-loop tensor Feynman integrals in a wide range of physical systems described by the relativistic QFTs at finite temperature and/or finite density, such as quark-gluon plasma in nuclear physics.</description>

Abstract: The spectrum consistency of the three fermion family $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124 (2020) 131601] is analyzed. It has been verified that the originally proposed action violates the unitarity consistency condition in the gauge field sector by exhibiting negative norm states in the spectrum. However, the cure came through the fundamental gauge fields properly settled, consequently, the action rewritten in terms of those fundamental fields shows to be free from any spurious degrees of freedom, and the model now becomes safe for further quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relaxation of holographic superfluids after quenches, when the end state is either tuned to be exactly at the critical point, or very close to it. By solving the bulk equations of motion numerically, we demonstrate that in the former case the system exhibits a power law falloff as well as an emergent discrete scale invariance. The later case is in the regime dominated by critical slowing down, and we show that there is an intermediate time-range before the onset of late time exponential falloff, where the system behaves similarly to the critical point with its power law falloff. We further postulate a phenomenological Gross-Pitaevskii-like equation that is able to make quantitative predictions for the behavior of the holographic superfluid after near-critical quenches. Intriguingly, all parameters of our phenomenological equation which describes the non-linear time evolution may be fixed with information from the static equilibrium solutions and linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Extensive Long-Range Entanglement at Finite Temperatures from a Nonequilibrium Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal equilibrium states of local quantum many-body systems are notorious for their spatially decaying correlations, which place severe restrictions on the types of many-body entanglement structures that may be observed at finite temperatures. These restrictions may however be defied when an out-of-equilibrium steady state is considered instead. In this paper, we study the entanglement properties of free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice that contains a generic charge- and energy-conserving noninteracting impurity, and that is connected at its edges to two reservoirs with different equilibrium energy distributions. These distributions may differ in either temperature, chemical potential, or both, thereby inducing an external bias. We analytically derive exact asymptotic expressions for several quantum information measures -- the mutual information, its R\'enyi generalizations, and the fermionic negativity -- that quantify the correlation and entanglement between two subsystems located on opposite sides of the impurity. We show that all these measures scale (to a leading order) linearly with the overlap between one subsystem and the mirror image of the other (upon reflection of the latter about the impurity), independently of the distance between the subsystems. While a simple proportionality relation between the negativity and R\'enyi versions of the mutual information is observed to hold at zero temperature, it breaks down at finite temperatures, suggesting that these quantities represent strong long-range correlations of different origins. Our results generalize previous findings that were limited to the case of a chemical-potential bias at zero temperature, rigorously demonstrating that the effect of long-range volume-law entanglement is robust at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Crystalline invariants of fractional Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of crystalline symmetry, topologically ordered states can acquire a host of symmetry-protected invariants. These determine the patterns of crystalline symmetry fractionalization of the anyons in addition to fractionally quantized responses to lattice defects. Here we show how ground state expectation values of partial rotations centered at high symmetry points can be used to extract crystalline invariants. Using methods from conformal field theory and G-crossed braided tensor categories, we develop a theory of invariants obtained from partial rotations, which apply to both Abelian and non-Abelian topological orders. We then perform numerical Monte Carlo calculations for projected parton wave functions of fractional Chern insulators, demonstrating remarkable agreement between theory and numerics. For the topological orders we consider, we show that the Hall conductivity, filling fraction, and partial rotation invariants fully characterize the crystalline invariants of the system. Our results also yield invariants of continuum fractional quantum Hall states protected by spatial rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>MPSDynamics.jl: Tensor network simulations for finite-temperature (non-Markovian) open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.</description>
