      <title>Metastable phase separation and information retrieval in multicomponent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fixed lines of $S=1/2$ XXZ chain with next-nearest neighbor interaction and $sl_2$ loop algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin systems are important to understand various physical properties in quantum many-body systems. We numerically study the Gaussian fixed lines (GFLs) of the $S=1/2$ XXZ chain with next-nearest neighbor (NNN) interaction in the XY phase. The GFLs are the set of points where the coefficient of the umklapp scattering vanishes. We show that the GFLs pass through the ``special points'', which are defined as the points where the $sl_2$ loop algebra symmetry governs in low-energy physics. In addition, we have discussed the Tomonaga-Luttinger parameter K, and the metamagnetism influences the shape of the GFLs.</description>

      <title>Frustration-Enhanced Quantum Annealing Correction Models with Additional Inter-replica Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing correction (QAC) models provide a promising approach for mitigating errors in quantum annealers. Previous studies have established that QAC models are crucial for ensuring the robustness of the ground state of the Ising model on hardware. In this work, the effects of QAC models incorporating replicas with additional interactions, specifically, the penalty spin model and the stacked model, are investigated for problems characterized by a small energy gap between the ground and first excited states during quantum annealing, a well-known bottleneck to reaching the ground state. The results demonstrate that these QAC models can obtain the optimal solution within short annealing times by exploiting diabatic transitions, even for problems with a small energy gap. These findings highlight the potential of QAC models as practical near-term algorithms for hardware subject to runtime limitations and control noise.</description>

      <title>Mean first-passage time of a run-and-tumble particle with exponentially-distributed tumble duration in the presence of a drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a finite interval $[a,b]$ with two absorbing end points. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between three values $v,0,-v$ at exponential times, thus incorporating positive tumble times. Moreover, a constant drift is added to the run-and-tumble motion at all times. The combination of these two features constitutes the main novelty of our model. The densities of the first-passage time through $a$ (given the initial position and velocity states) satisfy certain forward Fokker--Planck equations. The Laplace transforms of these equations induce evolution equations for the exit probabilities and the mean first-passage times of the particle. We solve these equations explicitly for all possible initial states. We consider the limiting regimes of instantaneous tumble and/or the limit of large $b$ tend to infinity to confirm consistency with existing results in the literature. In particular, in the limit of a half-line (large $b$), the mean first-passage time conditioned on the exit through $a$ is an affine function of the initial position if the drift is positive, as in the case of instantaneous tumble.</description>

      <title>Optimizing optimal transport: Role of final distributions in finite-time thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing thermodynamic tasks within finite time while minimizing thermodynamic costs is a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics. Here, we develop a unified framework for optimizing the thermodynamic cost of performing various tasks in finite time for overdamped Langevin systems. Conventional optimization of thermodynamic cost based on optimal transport theory leaves room for varying the final distributions according to the intended task, enabling further optimization. Taking advantage of this freedom, we use Lagrange multipliers to derive the optimal final distribution that minimizes the thermodynamic cost. Our framework applies to a wide range of thermodynamic tasks, including particle transport, thermal squeezing, and information processing such as information erasure, measurement, and feedback. Our results are expected to provide design principles for information-processing devices and thermodynamic machines that operate at high speed with low energetic costs.</description>

      <title>Resetting Induces Memory Loss in Non-Markovian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a powerful strategy known to accelerate the first-passage time statistics of stochastic processes. While its effects on Markovian systems are well understood, a general framework for non-Markovian dynamics is still lacking, mostly due to its mathematical complexity. Here, we present an analytical and numerical framework to study non-Markovian processes under resetting, focusing on the first-passage properties of escape kinetics from metastable states. We show that resetting disrupts the inherent time correlation, inducing Markovianity, thereby leading to an efficient escape mechanism. This work, therefore, provides a much needed theoretical approach for incorporating resetting into complex chemical and biological processes, which follow non-Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger-invariance in the voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact single-time and two-time correlations and the two-time response function are found for the order-parameter in the voter model with nearest-neighbour interactions. Their explicit dynamical scaling functions are shown to be continuous functions of the space dimension $d&gt;0$. Their form reproduces the predictions of non-equilibrium representations of the Schr\"odinger algebra for models with dynamical exponent $\mathpzc{z}=2$ and with the dominant noise-source coming from the heat bath. Hence the ageing in the voter model is a paradigm for relaxations in non-equilibrium critical dynamics, without detailed balance, and with the upper critical dimension $d^*=2$.</description>

      <title>Improving the efficiency of finite-time memory erasure with potential barrier shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erasure of the binary memory, 0 or 1, is an essential step for digital computation as it involves irreversible logic operations. In the classical case, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a minimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved in the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed within a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is observed that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat released, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this is a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time memory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the field of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to the two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However, the potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover, the two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in structure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the success rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released associated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier partitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving the efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the thermodynamic costs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic restarting with multiple restart conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a diffusive particle in a potential landscape with the extra condition that the particle is reset to its original position with some rate r. We study non-smooth and non-convex potentials and focus on the case where the restart rate depends on the space coordinate. There, we show that it is beneficial to restart at a lower rate once you are closer to your intended target.</description>

      <title>A shortcut through the macroscopic fluctuation theory: a generalised Fick law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic fluctuation theory is a powerful tool to characterise the large scale dynamical properties of diffusive systems, both in- and out-of-equilibrium. It relies on an action formalism in which, at large scales, the dynamics is fully determined by the minimum of the action. Within this formalism, the analysis of the statistical properties of a given observable reduces to solving the Euler-Lagrange equations with the appropriate boundary conditions. One must then compute the action at its minimum to deduce the cumulant generating function of the observable. This typically involves computing multiple integrals of cumbersome expressions. Recently, a simple formula has been conjectured to shortcut this last step, and compute the cumulant generating function of different observables (integrated current or position of a tracer) without the need to compute any integral. In this work, we prove this simple formula, and extend it to more general observables. We then illustrate the efficiency of this approach by applying it to compute the variance of a generalised current in the semi-infinite symmetric exclusion process and the joint properties of two occupation times in any diffusive system. In the case of the integrated current, our formula can be interpreted as a generalisation of Fick's law to obtain all the cumulants of the current beyond the average value.</description>

      <title>A complex scalar field theory for charged fluids, superfluids, and fracton fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a field-theoretic framework for ideal hydrodynamics of charged relativistic fluids formulated in terms of a complex scalar field defined on a spacelike hypersurface comoving with the fluid. In the normal phase, the dynamics of charge-carrying fluids is constrained by the restrictive chemical shift symmetry, which locks charges to fixed positions in the comoving plane as they are transported through space by the fluid's motion. On the other hand, in the superfluid phase, the chemical shift symmetry is relaxed to a constant shift, allowing charges to redistribute freely across the comoving hypersurface. We demonstrate that both models recover the respective nonlinear hydrodynamic equations and provide explicit expressions for the collective variables of hydrodynamics in terms of the theory's fields. Introduced models provide a UV completion to the effective field theories of hydrodynamics constructed in terms of the Goldstone fields. Finally, we propose a relativistic fracton fluid phase as a natural interpolation between the normal and superfluid phases, in which the mobility of elementary charges is constrained by a linear shift symmetry in the comoving space.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Shannon Renyi Equivalence: Exact Results for Quantum Critical Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shannon-Renyi and stabilizer entropies are key diagnostics of structure, non-stabilizerness, phase transitions, and universality in quantum many-body states. We establish an exact correspondence for quadratic fermions: for any nondegenerate Gaussian eigenstate, the stabilizer Renyi entropy equals the Shannon-Renyi entropy of a number-conserving free-fermion eigenstate on a doubled system, evaluated in the computational basis. Specializing to the transverse-field Ising (TFI) chain, the TFI ground state stabilizer entropies maps to the Shannon-Renyi entropies of the XX-chain ground state of length $2L$. Building on this correspondence, together with other exact identities we prove, closed expressions for the stabilizer entropy at indices $\alpha=\frac{1}{2},2,4$ for a broad class of critical closed free-fermion systems were derived. Each of these can be written with respect to the universal functions of the TFI chain. We further obtain conformal-field-theory scaling laws for the stabilizer entropy under both periodic and open boundaries at arbitrary Renyi index for these critical systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Phase of Stochastic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several definitions of phase have been proposed for stochastic oscillators, among which the mean-return-time phase and the stochastic asymptotic phase have drawn particular attention. Quantitative comparisons between these two definitions have been done in previous studies, but physical interpretations of such a relation are still missing. In this work, we illustrate this relation using the geometric phase, which is an essential concept in both classical and quantum mechanics. We use properties of probability currents and the generalized Doob's h-transform to explain how the geometric phase arises in stochastic oscillators. Such an analogy is also reminiscent of the noise-induced phase shift in oscillatory systems with deterministic perturbation, allowing us to compare the phase responses in deterministic and stochastic oscillators. The resulting framework unifies these distinct phase definitions and reveals that their difference is governed by a geometric drift term analogous to curvature. This interpretation bridges spectral theory, stochastic dynamics, and geometric phase, and provides new insight into how noise reshapes oscillatory behavior. Our results suggest broader applications of geometric-phase concepts to coupled stochastic oscillators and neural models.</description>

      <title>Erasing Classical Memory with Quantum Fluctuations: Shannon Information Entropy of Reverse Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealers can provide non-local optimization by tunneling between states in a process that ideally eliminates memory of the initial configuration. We study the crossover between memory loss and retention due to quantum fluctuations, in a transverse Ising model on odd numbered antiferromagnetic rings of thousands of spins with periodic boundary conditions, by performing reverse quantum annealing experiments on three programmable superconducting flux qubit quantum annealers. After initializing the spins to contain a single domain wall, we then expose it to quantum fluctuations by turning on the transverse Zeeman energy. We characterize the crossover between memory retention at low transverse field, and memory loss at high transverse field by extracting the Shannon information entropy of magnetic domain wall distributions. We demonstrate a clear crossover in memory retention, and its dependence on hardware platform and simulation time. Our approach establishes a general probe of the interplay between quantum fluctuations and memory.</description>

      <title>Entropic active particle transport in pulsating 3D geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transport of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in three-dimensional (3D) oscillatory geometries, which are spatially periodic. We establish a generalized Fick-Jacobs approach, which reduces a 3D system to an effective 1D system based on the assumption that a fast equilibration of particles along the transversal directions of the geometry. The transport characteristics of ABPs are computed semi-analytically and corroborated by numerical simulations. At the optimal frequency of the geometry oscillation, particles exhibit higher average velocity $\langle v \rangle$ and effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{eff}}$, resembling the phenomena of stochastic resonance. This effect is further enhanced by the self-propelled velocity of ABPs and the amplitude of geometry oscillations. These findings have significant implications for the development of micro- and nanofluidic devices with enhanced control over particle transport and precise manipulation of small-scale biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>The phase transitions of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phase transitions of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice using the non-perturbative first principle Monte Carlo simulations. Here $J_1 &lt; 0$ and $J_2 &gt; 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest couplings, respectively. In particular, the values of $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8,$ and 1.0 are considered in our study. Based on the numerical outcomes, we find that the phase transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.20, 0.22, 0.23,$ and 0.24 are second order and are governed by the 2D Ising universality class. In addition, we find evidence to support the facts that there are transitions for $J_2/|J_1| = 0.5, 0.8$ and 1.0 and these phase transitions are second order. Our results also indicate phase transition is unlikely to take place for $g=0.3$. We are not able to obtain results for $J_2/|J_1|$ $\in$ (0.24, 0.3) because the associated integrated autocorrelation times or (and) the equilibrium times are extremely large at the low-temperature region. A comparison between the outcomes presented here and the available results in the literature is briefly conducted as well.</description>

      <title>Quantum hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations with U(1) gauge fields: Application to the Aharonov-Bohm ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional subsystem under a time-dependent U(1) gauge field coupled to rotationally invariant environments. To capture the dynamic behavior of the subsystem under thermal excitations and dissipations, it is imperative to treat the bath in a non-Markovian and nonperturbative manner. This is because quantum noise is constrained by the uncertainty principle, which dictates the relationship between the noise correlation time and the amplitude of the energy fluctuation. To this end, we derive the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) incorporating the gauge field, enabling a rigorous investigation of the dynamics of the reduced subsystem. Transforming the HEOM into the Wigner representation yields quantum hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations [U(1)-QHFPE] with U(1) gauge fields. These equations incorporate vector fields into the damping operators while preserving both gauge invariance and rotational symmetry. To demonstrate the practical use of the formalism, the effects of a heat bath in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring. Our investigation includes simulations of the equilibrium distribution, linear absorption spectra, and AB currents under thermal conditions. Within a rotationally invariant system-bath (RISB) model, we predict the emergence of a persistent current even in dissipative environments, provided the bath is non-Markovian and the temperature is sufficiently low. We also assessed the validity of the Caldeira-Leggett model in this context.</description>

      <title>A dynamical approach to studying the Lee-Yang zeros for the Potts Model on the Cayley Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T &gt; 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J &gt; 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J &lt; 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two.
  These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by M\"uller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki Model for Quantum Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model to a spin-\(S\) ferromagnetic model with exactly-written ground states, known as the partially-magnetized valence bond solid (VBS) states with magnetization $m=(S-1)/S$.
  We find that the VBS state and an antiferromagnetic ground state with magnetization $m=0$ are degenerate for $S=3/2$ and $S=2$ by using the Lanczos method and the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG).
  However, increasing $S$, the magnetization of the ground states is uniquely determined as the fraction $m=(S-1)/S$.
  This is not just a ferromagnet, but a quantum ferromagnet due to quantum entanglement inherent in VBS states.
  In the low-energy excitation spectrum, we find the coexistence of the Haldane gap and Goldstone-like ferromagnetic magnon excitation.
  This ``magnetic chimera'' clearly appears under a finite magnetic field.
  Finally, we discuss an application to the measurement-based quantum computation and an extension of the Haldane's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Emergent order from mixed chaos at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel connection between a thermodynamic and a dynamical systems perspective on emergent dynamical order. We provide evidence for a conjecture that Hamiltonian systems with mixed chaos spontaneously find regular behavior when minimally coupled to a thermal bath at sufficiently low temperature. Numerical evidence across a diverse set of five dynamical systems supports this conjecture, and allows us to quantify corollaries about the organization timescales and disruption of order at higher temperatures. Balancing the damping-induced phase-space contraction against thermal exploration, we are able to predict the transition temperatures in terms of the relaxation timescales, indicating a novel nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation, and formally connecting the thermodynamic and dynamical systems views. Our findings suggest that for a wide range of real-world systems, coupling to a cold thermal bath leads to emergence of robust, non-trivial dynamical order, rather than a mere reduction of motion as in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The threshold and quasi-stationary distribution for the SIS model on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model on arbitrary networks. The well-established pair approximation treats neighboring pairs of nodes exactly while making a mean field approximation for the rest of the network. We improve the method by expanding the state space dynamically, giving nodes a memory of when they last became susceptible. The resulting approximation is simple to implement and appears to be highly accurate, both in locating the epidemic threshold and in computing the quasi-stationary fraction of infected individuals above the threshold, for both finite graphs and infinite random graphs.</description>

      <title>Fusion in the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra: general definition of a bifunctor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states.
  We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the work of Belliard, Pimenta and Slavnov (2024) studying the modified rational six vertex model. We find another formula of the partition function for the inhomogeneous model, in terms of a determinant that mix the modified Izergin one and a Vandermonde one. This expression enables us to compute the partition function in the homogeneous limit for the rectangular lattice, and then to study the thermodynamic limit. It leads to a new result, we obtain the first order of free energy with boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Spectral Small-Incremental-Entangling: Breaking Quasi-Polynomial Complexity Barriers in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in quantum complexity is how entanglement structure emerges from dynamics, highlighted by advances in simulators and information processing. The Lieb--Robinson bound sets a locality-based speed limit on information propagation, while the Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem gives a universal constraint on entanglement growth. Yet, SIE bounds only total entanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for R\'enyi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling R\'enyi entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend SIE and provide a unified framework that reveals the detailed structure of quantum complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of a strongly interacting dissipative quantum Ising spin chain that is driven by a slowly varying time-dependent transverse field. This system possesses an extensive number of instantaneous (adiabatic) stationary states which are coupled through non-adiabatic transitions. We analytically calculate the generator of the ensuing slow dynamics and analyze the creation of coherences through non-adiabatic processes. For a certain choice of the transverse field shape, we show that the system solely undergoes transitions among classical basis states after each pulse. The concatenation of many of such pulses leads to an evolution of the spin chain under a many-body dynamics that features kinetic constraints. Our setting not only allows for a quantitative investigation of adiabatic theorems and non-adiabatic corrections in a many-body scenario. It also directly connects to many-body systems in the focus of current research, such as ensembles of interacting Rydberg atoms which are resonantly excited by a slowly varying laser pulse and subject to dephasing noise.</description>

      <title>Predicting Structural Relaxation in Supercooled Small Molecules via Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Microscopic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of small organic molecules is critical for applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to energy and food preservation. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that combines molecular dynamics simulations and Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the structural relaxation behavior of small organic glass-formers. By using propanol, glucose, fructose, and trehalose as model systems, we estimate the glass transition temperature (Tg) from stepwise cooling simulations and volume-temperature analysis. These computed Tg values are then inserted into the ECNLE theory to calculate temperature-dependent relaxation times and diffusion coefficients. Numerical results agree well with experimental data in prior works. This approach provides a predictive and experimentally-independent route for characterizing glassy dynamics in molecular materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a theoretical study of the scaling properties of the kinetic energy spectrum in compressible turbulence. From the fundamental symmetries and linear transformations of the microscopic action, we derive exact relations between the correlation functions and their generators. These relations put strong constraints on the possible scaling relations in the system as a function of scale. One of the main results of this study is that the action can be split between an incompressible part, which is the same as in the usual stochastic Navier-Stokes theory whatever the value of the Mach number, and a longitudinal part, whose behavior is to be compared to the three dimensional Burgers equation, which presents a much richer phase diagram as its usually discussed one dimensionalcounterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield model describes a neural network that stores memories using all-to-all-coupled spins. Memory patterns are recalled under equilibrium dynamics. Storing too many patterns breaks the associative recall process because frustration causes an exponential number of spurious patterns to arise as the network becomes a spin glass. Despite this, memory recall in a spin glass can be restored, and even enhanced, under quantum-optical nonequilibrium dynamics because spurious patterns can now serve as reliable memories. We experimentally observe associative memory with high storage capacity in a driven-dissipative spin glass made of atoms and photons. The capacity surpasses the Hopfield limit by up to seven-fold in a sixteen-spin network. Atomic motion boosts capacity by dynamically modifying connectivity akin to short-term synaptic plasticity in neural networks, realizing a precursor to learning in a quantum-optical system.</description>

      <title>Data-Induced Interactions of Sparse Sensors Using Statistical Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-dimensional empirical data in science and engineering frequently have a low-rank structure and can be represented as a combination of just a few eigenmodes. Because of this structure, we can use just a few spatially localized sensor measurements to reconstruct the full state of a complex system. The quality of this reconstruction, especially in the presence of sensor noise, depends significantly on the spatial configuration of the sensors. Multiple algorithms based on gappy interpolation and QR factorization have been proposed to optimize sensor placement. Here, instead of an algorithm that outputs a single "optimal" sensor configuration, we take a statistical mechanics view to compute the full landscape of sensor interactions induced by the training data. The two key advances of this paper are the recasting of the sensor placement landscape in an Ising model form and a regularized reconstruction that significantly decreases reconstruction error for few sensors. In addition, we provide first uncertainty quantification of the sparse sensing reconstruction and open questions about the shape of reconstruction risk curve. Mapping out these data-induced sensor interactions allows combining them with external selection criteria and anticipating sensor replacement impacts.</description>

Abstract: We set out to explore the possibility of investigating the critical behavior of systems with first-order phase transition using deep machine learning. We propose a machine learning protocol with ternary classification of instantaneous spin configurations using known values of disordered phase energy and ordered phase energy. The trained neural network is used to predict whether a given sample belong to one or another phase of matter. This allows us to estimate for the first time the probability that configurations with a certain energy belong to the ordered phase, coexistence phase, and disordered phase. Based on these probabilities, we obtained estimates of the values of the critical energies and latent heat for the Potts model with 10 and 20 components, which undergoes a strong discontinuous transition. We also found that the probabilities may reflect geometric transitions in the coexistence phase.</description>

      <title>Analog of the Carnot engine for fluctuating diffusivity in living cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a formal analogy between the fluctuating diffusivity and thermodynamics has been proposed based on phenomena of heterogeneous diffusion observed in living cells. This not only offers the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also achieves that of the Clausius inequality for the entropy concerning diffusivity fluctuations. Here, a discussion is developed about constructing a heat-like engine in terms of the fluctuating diffusivity. The engine constitutes two kinds of processes with the average diffusivity or the average local temperature being kept fixed, along which the fluctuation distribution obeys an exponential law. The efficiency of the engine in a cycle, which quantifies how much the diffusivity change as the analog of work can be extracted, is found to formally coincide with that of Carnot's. During the cycle, the total change of the entropy is also shown to vanish.</description>

      <title>Accelerated first-passage dynamics in a non-Markovian feedback Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the first-passage dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the particle drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we calculate the leading order asymptotics of the time-dependent distribution of the particle position, derive the most probable paths that reach the specified position at a given time and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean first-passage time, and show that the feedback accelerates dynamics by storing finite-time fluctuations, thereby lowering the effective energy barrier and shifting the optimal first-passage time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate the dynamics. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control first-passage dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Systems that are driven by a randomly timed, external protocol can seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. We show that this thermodynamic paradox is resolved if the outcome of the random time is stored in a memory device. Specifically, we show that the average work required to erase the memory is always larger than the average work gained from the protocol. We also discuss concrete setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols.</description>

      <title>Heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of time-delayed dynamics remain largely unexplored, especially for systems that exhibit asymptotically non-stationary behavior. Here, we investigate heat dissipation in two classes of marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin dynamics: (i) diffusive criticality, which asymptotically manifests as scaled Brownian diffusion, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, which shows oscillation with diffusive amplitude. By analytical derivations, we find fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: the average heat dissipation rate asymptotically approaches a constant for diffusive criticality but diverges linearly with oscillations for oscillatory criticality, despite both showing linearly growing variance over time. We further numerically study the probability distributions of heat dissipation rates for both types of critical dynamics. Our results demonstrate that non-stationary time-delayed dynamics with similar scaling can yield qualitatively distinct heat dissipation behaviors, depending on the underlying dynamical details. This work provides a concrete foundation for future investigations into thermodynamic properties of general nonlinear time-delayed systems.</description>

      <title>Coarse Graining Photo-Isomerization Reactions: Thermodynamic Consistency and Implications for Molecular Ratchets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate thermodynamically consistent coarse-graining procedures for molecular systems undergoing thermally and photo-induced transitions: starting from elementary vibronic transitions, we derive effective photo-isomerization reactions interconverting ground-state species. Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, that constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, like chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals that their design and optimization should prioritize molecular properties governing the information ratchet mechanism, rather than those influencing energetic bias.</description>

      <title>Markov dualities via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of Markov duality between two Markov processes that can live in two different configurations spaces $(x,{\tilde x})$ is revisited via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. In this formulation, the two generators should have the same eigenvalues $(-E)$ that may be complex, while the duality function $\Omega(x,{\tilde x})$ can be considered as a mapping between the right and the left eigenvectors of the two models. We describe how this spectral perspective is useful to better understand two well-known dualities between processes defined in the same configuration space: the Time-Reversal duality corresponds to an exchange between the right and the left eigenvectors that involves the steady state, while in the Siegmund duality, the left eigenvectors correspond to integrals of the dual right eigenvectors. We then focus on the famous Moment-Duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion on the interval $x \in [0,1] $ and the Kingman Markov jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$ in order to analyze the relations between their eigenvectors living in two different configuration spaces. Finally, we discuss how the spectral perspective can be used to construct new dualities and we give an example for the case of non-degenerate real eigenvalues, where one can always construct a dual Directed Jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$, whose transitions rates are the opposite-eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a self-consistent methodology for determining the work involved in an adiabatic process where the dynamics of a Brownian particle is trapped in an optical tweezers. Instead of varying the frequency of the trap, it is displaced through a defined protocol. Assuming the dynamics follow a modified generalized Langevin equation previously proposed by the author, it is found that the external adiabatic driving is uniquely derived in terms of the system's dynamical properties, and unlike isothermal processes, does not require optimization. There is no need to include other parameters than those characterizing the model.</description>

Abstract: We adapt statistical models of the physics of complex fluids to study the rheology of granular liquids. This allows us to provide laws of granular rheology based on first principles, which compare well with previously established phenomenological laws. In particular, the very successful law of mu(I) rheology can be understood within our model as the lowest order non trivial Pade approximant of the macroscopic laws of rheology. Our model's ability to describe granular physics outside of the Bagnold scaling regime allows for a natural extension to the rheology of granular suspensions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations for spin systems and point processes: near-optimal rates via quantitative Marcinkiewicz's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.08469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations for functionals of a large class of spin models and strongly correlated random point fields, achieving near-optimal rates. For spin models, we demonstrate Gaussian asymptotics for the magnetization for a wide class of ferromagnetic spin systems on Euclidean lattices, in particular those with continuous spins. Specific applications include, in particular, the celebrated XY and Heisenberg models under ferromagnetic conditions, and more broadly, systems with very general rotationally invariant spins in arbitrary dimensions. We address both the setting of free boundary conditions and a large class of ferromagnetic boundary conditions, and our CLTs are endowed with near-optimal rate. Our approach leverages the classical Lee-Yang theory for the zeros of partition functions, and subsumes as a special case results of Lebowitz, Ruelle, Pittel and Speer on CLTs in discrete statistical mechanical models for which we obtain sharper convergence rates. In a different direction, we obtain CLTs for linear statistics of a wide class of point processes known as $\alpha$-determinantal point processes which interpolate between negatively and positively associated random point fields. We contribute a unified approach to CLTs in such models; significantly, our approach is able to analyse such processes in dimensions $\ge 3$, where structural alternatives such as connections to random matrix theory are not available. A key ingredient of our approach is a broad, quantitative extension of the classical Marcinkiewicz Theorem that holds under the limited condition that the characteristic function is non-vanishing only on a bounded disk. In spite of the general applicability of the results, our rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen bounds for independent sums up to a log factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate why, in quantum many-body systems, the adiabatic fidelity and the overlap between the initial state and instantaneous ground states often yield nearly identical values. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon results from an interplay between two intrinsic limits of many-body systems: the limit of small evolution parameters and the limit of large system sizes. In the former case, conventional perturbation theory provides a straightforward explanation. In the latter case, a key insight is that pairs of vectors in the Hilbert space orthogonal to the initial state tend to become nearly orthogonal as the system size increases. We illustrate these general findings with two representative models of driven many-body systems: the driven Rice-Mele model and the driven interacting Kitaev chain model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity; despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this study, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate the emergence of negative energetic elasticity in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fixing Quantum Density Operators At Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into global incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings, beyond qubit engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: The study of spin-glass dynamics, long considered the paradigmatic complex system, has reached important milestones. The availability of single crystals has allowed the experimental measurement of spin-glass coherence lengths of almost macroscopic dimensions, while the advent of special-purpose computers enables dynamical simulations that approach experimental scales. This review provides an account of the quantitative convergence of these two avenues of research, with precise experimental measurements of the expected scaling laws and numerical reproduction of classic experimental results, such as memory and rejuvenation. The article opens with a brief review of the defining spin-glass properties, randomness and frustration, and their experimental consequences. These apparently simple characteristics are shown to generate rich and complex physics. Models are introduced that enable quantitative dynamical descriptions. After a summary of the main numerical results in equilibrium, paying particular attention to temperature chaos, this review examines off-equilibrium dynamics in the absence of a magnetic field and shows how it can be related to equilibrium structures through the fluctuation-dissipation relations. The nonlinear response at a given temperature is then developed, including experiments and scaling in the vicinity of the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{g}$. The consequences of temperature change $\unicode{x2013}$including temperature chaos, rejuvenation, and memory$\unicode{x2013}$ are reviewed. The interpretation of these phenomena requires identifying several length scales relevant to dynamics, which, in turn, generate new insights. Finally, issues for future investigations are introduced, including what is to be nailed down theoretically, why the Ising Edwards-Anderson model is so successful at modeling spin-glass dynamics, and experiments yet to be undertaken.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration in Clifford Circuits and Beyond: From Random Tensor Networks to Pseudo-Magic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anticoncentration describes how an ensemble of quantum states spreads over the allowed Hilbert space, leading to statistically uniform output probability distributions. In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth, namely higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic-state injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling, many-body quantum physics, and the benchmarking of quantum computational advantage.</description>

      <title>Local Information Flow in Quantum Quench Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities -- termed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Theory of the Anderson transition in three-dimensional chiral symmetry classes: Connection to type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions governed by topological defects constitute a cornerstone of modern physics. Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional (3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an external magnetic field, respectively.</description>

      <title>DNA Unzipping Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review focuses on the force-induced unzipping transition of double-stranded DNA. It begins with a brief history of DNA melting, which emerged alongside the growth of the field of molecular biology, juxtaposed with the advancements in physics during the same post-World War II period. The earlier theories of melting of DNA were based on the Ising model and its modifications, but gradually moved towards polymer-based models. The idea of force-induced unzipping was first introduced in 1999 as a cooperative mechanism for breaking base pairs without the need for temperature changes. The paper discusses several subsequent developments addressing different aspects of the unzipping transition.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.</description>

      <title>How to simulate L\'evy flights in a steep potential: An explicit splitting numerical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
  In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
  This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of L\'evy flights in steep potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>Infinite temperature at zero energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.</description>
