      <title>PSF quality metrics in the problem of revealing Intermediate-Mass Black Holes using MICADO@ELT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, astronomers perform point spread function (PSF) fitting for most types of observational data. Interpolation of the PSF is often an intermediate step in such algorithms. In the case of the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) at the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), PSF interpolation will play a crucial role in high-precision astrometry for stellar clusters and confirmation of the Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) presence. Significant PSF variations across the field of view invalidate the approach of deconvolution with a mean PSF or on-axis PSF. The ignoring of PSF variations can be especially unsatisfactory in the case of Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) observations, as these sophisticated and expensive systems are designed to achieve high resolution with ground-based telescopes by correcting for atmospheric turbulence in the direction of one reference star. In plenty of tasks, you face the question: How can I establish the quality of PSF fitting or interpolation? Our study aims to demonstrate the variety of PSF quality metrics, including the problem of revealing IMBHs in stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Confusion Noise with Hyperspectral Imaging from PRIMAger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) concept aims to perform mapping with spectral coverage and sensitivities inaccessible to previous FIR space telescopes. PRIMA's imaging instrument, PRIMAger, provides unique hyperspectral imaging simultaneously covering 25-235 $\mu$m. We synthesise images representing a deep, 1500 hr deg$^{-2}$ PRIMAger survey, with realistic instrumental and confusion noise. We demonstrate that we can construct catalogues of galaxies with a high purity ($&gt;95$ per cent) at a source density of 42k deg$^{-2}$ using PRIMAger data alone. Using the XID+ deblending tool we show that we measure fluxes with an accuracy better than 20 per cent to flux levels of 0.16, 0.80, 9.7 and 15 mJy at 47.4, 79.7, 172, 235 $\mu$m respectively. These are a factor of $\sim$2 and $\sim$3 fainter than the classical confusion limits for 72-96 $\mu$m and 126-235 $\mu$m, respectively. At $1.5 \leq z \leq 2$, we detect and accurately measure fluxes in 8-10 of the 10 channels covering 47-235 $\mu$m for sources with $2 \leq$ log(SFR) $\leq 2.5$, a 0.5 dex improvement on what might be expected from the classical confusion limit. Recognising that PRIMager will operate in a context where high quality data will be available at other wavelengths, we investigate the benefits of introducing additional prior information. We show that by introducing even weak prior flux information when employing a higher source density catalogue (more than one source per beam) we can obtain accurate fluxes an order of magnitude below the classical confusion limit for 96-235 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Tianyu: search for the second solar system and explore the dynamic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V &lt; 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement of mixed interference fringes in optical interferometers: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical interferometric imaging enables astronomical observation at extremely high angular resolution. The necessary optical information for imaging, such as the optical path differences and visibilities, is easy to extract from fringes generated by the combination of two beams. With more than two apertures, the image-plane interference pattern becomes an increasingly indistinguishable mixture of fringe spacings and directions. For decades, the state-of-the-art approaches for obtaining two-aperture fringes from an interferometer array composed of many apertures are limited to pairwise combinations using bulk optics. Here, we derive and demonstrate a fringe disentanglement theory that can digitally transform the interference pattern of N apertures to N(N-1)/2 pairwise fringes without any optics, thus providing straightforward methods of information acquisition for interferometers. We demonstrate applications of our technique by both simulation and experiment, showing that this theory can be used for simultaneously sensing pistons and determining the individual visibilities of all combining apertures. Furthermore, we use the proposed theory to phase a 1.5-meter segmented flat telescope, demonstrating its validity for engineering implementation. This theory may not only benefit optical imaging but also interferometry-based measurements, by providing an exceptional capability to simplify the interferometric output generated by a system of many apertures.</description>

      <title>Polluting White Dwarfs with Oort Cloud Comets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations point to old white dwarfs (WDs) accreting metals at a relatively constant rate over 8~Gyrs. Exo-Oort clouds around WDs have been proposed as potential reservoirs of materials, with galactic tide as a mechanism to deliver distant comets to the WD's Roche limit. In this work, we characterise the dynamics of comets around a WD with a companion having semi-major axes on the orders of 10 - 100 AU. We develop simulation techniques capable of integrating a large number ($10^8$) of objects over a 1 Gyr timescale. Our simulations include galactic tide and are capable of resolving close-interactions with a massive companion. Through simulations, we study the accretion rate of exo-Oort cloud comets into a WD's Roche limit. We also characterise the dynamics of precession and scattering induced on a comet by a massive companion. We find that (i) WD pollution by an exo-Oort cloud can be sustained over a Gyr timescale, (ii) an exo-Oort cloud with structure like our own Solar System's is capable of delivering materials into an isolated WD with pollution rate $\sim 10^8 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, (iii) adding a planetary-mass companion reduces the pollution rate to $\sim 10^7 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, and (iv) if the companion is stellar-mass, with $M_p \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot$, the pollution rate reduces to $\sim 3 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$ due to a combination of precession induced on a comet by the companion, a strong scattering barrier, and low-likelihood of direct collisions of comets with the companion.</description>

      <title>Reduced-resolution beamforming: lowering the computational cost for pulsar and technosignature surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In radio astronomy, the science output of a telescope is often limited by computational resources. This is especially true for transient and technosignature surveys that need to search high-resolution data across a large parameter space. The tremendous data volumes produced by modern radio array telescopes exacerbate these processing challenges. Here, we introduce a 'reduced-resolution' beamforming approach to alleviate downstream processing requirements. Our approach, based on post-correlation beamforming, allows sensitivity to be traded against the number of beams needed to cover a given survey area. Using the MeerKAT and Murchison Widefield Array telescopes as examples, we show that survey speed can be vastly increased, and downstream signal processing requirements vastly decreased, if a moderate sacrifice to sensitivity is allowed. We show the reduced-resolution beamforming technique is intimately related to standard techniques used in synthesis imaging. We suggest that reduced-resolution beamforming should be considered to ease data processing challenges in current and planned searches; further, reduced-resolution beamforming may provide a path toward computationally-expensive search strategies previously considered infeasible.</description>

      <title>Source Confusion from Neutron Star Binaries in Ground-Based Gravitational Wave Detectors is Minimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upgrades beyond the current second generation of ground-based gravitational wave detectors will allow them to observe tens of thousands neutron star and black hole binaries. Given the typical minute-to-hour duration of neutron star signals in the detector frequency band, a number of them will overlap in the time-frequency plane resulting in a nonzero cross-correlation. We examine source confusion arising from overlapping signals whose time-frequency tracks cross. Adopting the median observed merger rate of $100$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, each neutron star binary signal overlaps with an average of 42(4)[0.5] other signals when observed from 2(5)[10] Hz. The vast majority of overlaps occur at low frequencies where the inspiral evolution is slow: 91% of time-frequency overlaps occur in band below 5 Hz. The combined effect of overlapping signals does not satisfy the central limit theorem and source confusion cannot be treated as stationary, Gaussian noise: on average 0.91(0.17)[0.05] signals are present in a single adaptive time-frequency bin centered at 2(5)[10] Hz. We quantify source confusion under a realistic neutron star binary population and find that parameter uncertainty typically increases by less than 1% unless there are overlapping signals whose detector-frame chirp mass difference is $\lesssim 0.01 M_{\odot}$ and the overlap frequency is $\gtrsim$ 40 Hz. Out of $1\times10^6$ simulated signals, 0.14% fall within this region of detector-frame chirp mass differences, but their overlap frequencies are typically lower than 40 Hz. Source confusion for ground-based detectors, where events overlap instantaneously is significantly milder than the equivalent LISA problem, where many classes of events overlap for the lifetime of the mission.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitationally lensed interstellar transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider interstellar light transmission facilitated by gravitational lensing. We study axially-symmetric lensing configurations where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. With the transmitter positioned in the focal region of the lens, we investigate the caustic formed by a diffraction-limited beam of light emitted by the transmitter. We evaluated the impact of the lens's point spread function (PSF) on the received beam. We estimate the power delivered to a receiver at interstellar distances, evaluate the major noise sources, and determine the detection sensitivity in both the noise- and signal-dominated regimes. Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of the received beam, a result of the PSF from the transmitting lens. We find that detection of the lensed optical signals from nearby stars may be done relying on established optical engineering technologies. Furthermore, a network of astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple narrow spectral bands will benefit the search. Our results support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to the ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>
