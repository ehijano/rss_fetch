      <title>D-branes and the planar limit of Chern-Simons theory I: Link invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Holographic duality between $SU(N)_\kappa$ Chern-Simons theory and the A-model Topological String Theory. We develop a strategy to systematically compute the large $N$ saddles for correlation functions of Wilson lines in antisymmetric powers $\Lambda^\bullet \mathbb{C}^N$ of the fundamental representation. The mathematical structures which appear in the calculation match in detail the data of dual A-model D-branes.</description>

      <title>Dirac brackets for classical radiative observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new coherent state expansion of the exponential representation of the S-matrix for the classical gravitational two-body problem. By combining the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism with the Dirac bracket structure emerging in the classical limit, we derive compact and gauge-invariant expressions for scattering observables in the presence of radiation. This causal formulation bypasses the calculation of KMOC cuts and provides a direct link between observables and a minimal set of classical matrix elements extracted from amplitudes. We illustrate our method with several examples, including the impulse, spin kick, angular momentum, waveform and the related radiative fluxes. Finally, using our formalism we evaluate for the first time the spin kick and the change in angular momentum of each particle up to $\mathcal{O}(G^2 s_1^{j_1} s_2^{j_2})$ with $j_1+ j_2 \leq 11$.</description>

      <title>Wall crossing structure from quantum phenomena to Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing body of evidence suggests that the complexity of Feynman integrals is best understood through geometry. Recent mathematical developments [Kontsevich and Soibelman, arXiv:2402.07343] have illuminated the role of exponential integrals as periods of twisted de Rham cocycles over Betti cycles, providing a structured approach to tackle this problem in many situations. In this paper, we apply these concepts to show how families of physically relevant integrals, ranging from exponentials to logarithmic multivalued functions, can be recast as twisted periods of differential forms over homology cycles. In the case of holomorphic exponents, we provide explicit decompositions as thimble expansions and reveal a geometric wall-crossing structure behind the analytic continuation in parameters. We then show that the generalization to multivalued functions provides the right framework to describe Feynman integrals in the Baikov representation, where the multivaluedness is governed by the logarithm of the Baikov polynomial. In this context, the thimble decomposition aligns with the decomposition into Master Integrals. We highlight how the wall-crossing structure allows for a sharp count of independent Master Integrals (or periods), circumventing complications arising from Stokes phenomena. Additionally, we study the large-parameter expansions of these integrals, whose coefficients correspond to periods of standard (co-)homology associated with families of algebraic varieties, and which reveal the dominant basis elements in different sectors of the wall crossing structure. This unifies perturbative expansions and geometric representation theory under a single cohomological framework.</description>

      <title>Laplacians in Various Dimensions and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The species cutoff is a moduli-dependent quantity signaling the onset of quantum gravitational phenomena, whose form can be oftentimes determined from higher-derivative and higher-curvature corrections within low-energy gravitational EFTs. In this work, we point out that these Wilson coefficients are eigenfunctions of an appropriate second-order elliptic operator defined over moduli space in theories with more than four supercharges. This was already known to be the case for the leading $\mathcal{R}^4$-correction to the two-derivative (bosonic) action of maximal supergravity in $d\leq 10$. Here, we reconsider this fact from the Swampland point of view and show how, in $d=10,9,8$, solving a Laplace equation imposes non-trivial restrictions on the species hull vectors. We further argue that this property is also satisfied in settings with less supersymmetry. In particular, we focus on the $\mathcal{R}^4$-operator in minimal supergravity theories in $d=10,9$, and on the leading $\mathcal{R}^2$-term in setups with 8 supercharges in $d=6,5,4$. Finally, we provide a symmetry-based criterion for determining when the relevant elliptic operator should be the Laplacian. A bottom-up rationale for this constraint remains to be fully understood, and we conclude by outlining some compelling possibilities.</description>

      <title>Krylov operator complexity in holographic CFTs: Smeared boundary reconstruction and the dual proper radial momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by bulk reconstruction of smeared boundary operators, we study the Krylov complexity of local and non-local primary CFT$_d$ operators from the local bulk-to-bulk propagator of a minimally-coupled massive scalar field in Rindler-AdS$_{d+1}$ space. We derive analytic and numerical evidence on how the degree of non-locality in the dual CFT$_d$ observable affects the evolution of Krylov complexity and the Lanczos coefficients. Curiously, the near-horizon limit matches with the same observable for conformally-coupled probe scalar fields inserted at the asymptotic boundary of AdS$_{d+1}$ space. Our results also show that the evolution of the growth rate of Krylov operator complexity in the CFT$_d$ takes the same form as to the proper radial momentum of a probe particle inside the bulk to a good approximation. The exact equality only occurs when the probe particle is inserted in the asymptotic boundary or in the horizon limit. Our results capture a prosperous interplay between Krylov complexity in the CFT, thermal ensembles at finite bulk locations and their role in the holographic dictionary.</description>

      <title>Backtracking AdS flux vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm (dubbed "flux backtracking") to reverse-engineer the brane picture from an AdS flux vacuum. Given an AdS flux vacuum as input, the algorithm outputs a singularity in 10 or 11 dimensions. This singularity has the property that when probed with the appropriate stack of branes (and after taking the near-horizon limit), one recovers the initial AdS vacuum. After testing the procedure on a number of known AdS/CFT pairs, we apply it to AdS flux vacua without known holographic dual, notably the scale-separated DGKT solution. In this case, flux backtracking produces a certain strongly coupled singularity in massive IIA; we conjecture that the worldvolume CFT of D4-branes probing this singularity should be the holographic CFT dual to DGKT (if it exists). Applying the procedure to the DGKT-related scale-separated AdS$_4$ solutions without Romans mass, we find instead a conical and weakly coupled singularity. We also comment on the results and limitations of applying the procedure to KKLT.</description>

      <title>Essential Renormalization Group Equation for Gravity coupled to a Scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the essential renormalization group equation, in which inessential couplings are removed via field redefinitions, for Einstein gravity coupled to a massive scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant. Our results indicate that perturbatively nonrenormalizable terms can be eliminated due to the cosmological term, in contrast to the case of perturbation around flat spacetime. We find a nontrivial fixed point for the Newton coupling and the cosmological term.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Classical BPS M5-brane on the plane wave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the bosonic theory for a single M5-brane on the plane-wave background and derive a family of BPS solutions with non-zero components of the angular momentum. By explicit construction of a BPS solution, we find the solution describes an ellipsoidal five-brane rotating without changing its shape. The methodology developed in this paper is expected to provide a strategy for obtaining the BPS solutions that correspond to a BPS sector in the dual gauge theory, such as the BMN matrix model.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric localisation of $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories on a spindle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmteric field theories living on a weighted projective space $\mathbb{WCP}_{[n_1,n_2]}^1$, often referred to as a spindle. Starting from the spindle solution of five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity, we construct a two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theory on a spindle, preserving supersymmetry via the anti-twist mechanism and admitting two Killing spinors of opposing $R$-charge. We apply the technique of supersymmetric localisation to compute the exact partition function for a theory consisting of an abelian vector multiplet and a chiral multiplet, finding that the path integral localises to a real moduli space of vector multiplet fluctuations. We compute the one-loop determinants via the equivariant index, using both the method of unpaired eigenvalues and the fixed point theorem, finding agreement between the two approaches. We conclude with the explicit example of a charged chiral multiplet in the presence of a Fayet-Iliopoulos term. This work paves the way towards uncovering two-dimensional dualities, such as mirror symmetry, for field theories defined on orbifold backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Notes on exact solvability for rotating and pulsating strings in nonrelativistic Lifshitz background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct one dimensional exactly solvable model by choosing a probe fundamental string rotating and pulsating in the planar Lifshitz spacetime that follows nonrelativistic Lifshitz scaling. We present suitable sets of embedding coordinates for rotating and pulsating strings to embed the string worldsheet on a hyperboloid with anisotropy-dependent eccentricity. The resulting worldsheet Lagrangians straightforwardly reduce to the Lagrangian of a Neumann-Rosochatius integrable model. Although the model assumes exact solutions for both the chosen ansatz its classical Liouville integrability is found to be conditional due to the presence of finite anisotropy in the target space geometry. We further use the exact solutions of the model to yield energy-momentum dispersion relations. We interpret those from the perspective of highly degenerate frustrated $J_1-J_2$ spin chain for rotating string and frustration-free Motzkin spin chain for pulsating string.</description>

      <title>A stringy dispersion relation for field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple, self-contained derivation of the local, parametric crossing symmetric dispersion relation for 2-2 scattering, which is motivated by string theory. In various limits of the parameter, this stringy dispersion relation goes over to various known dispersion relations like fixed-$t$, fixed-$s$, local crossing symmetric etc. We present formulas applicable for any number of subtractions. Several examples are discussed for illustration. In particular, the Veneziano and the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes are shown to admit series representations that manifest poles in all channels and converge everywhere. We then discuss applications to weakly-coupled gravitational EFTs, and explain how the parameter can be used to derive bounds on the Wilson coefficients by working in the forward limit ($t=0$), even in the presence of the graviton pole. Finally, our approach also enables us to find series representations for multi-variable, totally symmetric generalisations of the Venziano and Virasoro-Shapiro amplitudes that manifest poles in all the variables. In the future, this may be useful for finding $n$-particle dispersion relations, and we take the first steps in this direction.</description>

      <title>A Novel Construction of de Sitter Vacua in Heterotic String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a concrete string-theoretic mechanism that generates four-dimensional de Sitter vacua from non-geometric R-flux compactifications of heterotic string theory. The construction rests on three pillars: the Malcev algebra generated by the R-flux phase-space brackets; its universal Sabinin envelope, which ensures a consistent non-associative gauge structure in doubled geometry; and the leading alpha-prime torsion-squared correction to the heterotic action, whose strictly positive contribution uplifts the scalar potential. Positivity, guaranteed by Sabinin algebra identities, stabilizes the overall breathing mode at positive energy, yielding controlled metastable de Sitter solutions within the domain of heterotic effective field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the scattering matrix of two-dimensional integrable QFTs whose fields obey non-trivial exchange relations. We show that crossing equations for such models have to be modified, and propose their consistent modification. This modification opens the way to constructing new integrable S~matrices. As a check, we consider the crossing equations for the $SU(N)$ chiral Gross-Neveu model, and for the $\Phi_{21}$ deformation of the tricritical Ising model, finding an agreement with the existing proposals. Finally, we reconsider the crossing equations for massless excitations of the mixed-flux $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ light-cone gauge superstring sigma model, and conjecture that the massless excitations satisfy non-trivial exchange relations. This changes the crossing equations and leads to a simpler massless dressing factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the correspondence between universal statistical features of large-$c$ 2d CFTs and surgery methods in pure AdS$_3$ quantum gravity. In particular, we introduce a method that we call RMT surgery, which relates a large class of off-shell partition functions in 3d gravity to the spectral statistics of general CFT observables. We apply this method to construct and compute an off-shell Euclidean wormhole whose boundaries are four-punctured spheres, which captures level repulsion in the high-energy sector of the boundary CFT. Using a similar gluing prescription, we also explore a new class of off-shell torus wormholes with trumpet boundaries, contributing to statistical moments of the density of primary states. Lastly, we demonstrate that surgery methods can be used as an intermediate step towards computing Seifert manifolds directly in 3d gravity.</description>

Abstract: We review applications of factorization methods to the problem of finding stationary point vortex patterns in two-dimensional fluid mechanics. Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Charged Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20040v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct static, spherically symmetric, charged traversable wormhole solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell equations, supported by bidirectional (ingoing and outgoing) null dust with negative energy, and discuss a scenario for their dynamical formation from a black hole. Our solution contains a traversable throat, where the areal radius takes a minimum, although the spacetime is not asymptotically flat. In our formation scenario, the spacetime evolves sequentially from a black hole to Vaidya regions and finally to a wormhole, with each transition mediated by an impulsive null shell. We find that the radius of the wormhole throat is determined by the mass and charge of the initial black hole as well as those of the injected shell.</description>

      <title>High-energy dynamics of QCD: Theoretical and phenomenological results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the behavior of hadronic matter in the high-energy Regge-Gribov (semi-hard) regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), accessible through current and future colliders such as the LHC, EIC, and FCC. Central to the analysis is the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) formalism, with detailed treatment of the BFKL equation in both leading and next-to-leading logarithmic approximations. A major focus is placed on the computation of real next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to the Higgs boson impact factor, incorporating finite top-quark mass effects. These corrections are essential for improving precision in Higgs production processes at large rapidity separations. The study also explores the semi-inclusive production of exotic tetraquark states, employing a hybrid framework that combines collinear and BFKL dynamics within a variable-flavor number scheme. Updated fragmentation functions for bottomonium-like states are provided, offering improved predictions at 14 TeV and 100 TeV. Additionally, the work addresses diffractive di-hadron production in the small-x saturation regime using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism, presenting preliminary leading-order analytical results.</description>

      <title>Tensor Renormalization Group Meets Computer Assistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor renormalization group, originally devised as a numerical technique, is emerging as a rigorous analytical framework for studying lattice models in statistical physics. Here we introduce a new renormalization map - the 2x1 map - which coarse-grains the lattice anisotropically by a factor of two in one direction followed by a 90-degree rotation. We develop a novel graphical language that translates the action of the 2x1 map into a system of inequalities on tensor components, with rigorous estimates in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We define a finite-dimensional "bounding box" called the hat-tensor, and a master function governing its RG flow. Iterating this function numerically, we establish convergence to the high-temperature fixed point for tensors lying within a quantifiable neighborhood. Our main theorem shows that tensors with deviations bounded by 0.02 in 63 orthogonal sectors flow to the fixed point. We also apply the method to specific models - the 2D Ising and XY models - obtaining explicit bounds on their high-temperature phase. This work brings the Tensor RG program closer towards a rigorous, computer-assisted construction of critical fixed points.</description>

      <title>Could Planck Star Remnants be Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the end state of gravitational collapse under quantum gravity effects and propose that Planck Star Remnants (PSR), formed via nonsingular bounces, could serve as viable dark matter candidates. Within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter distribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using the Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally hidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This naturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius coincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the Planck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants may originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe, and estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed dark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and previous proposals of Planck mass relics. The scenario is shown to be consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological constraints, offering a unified framework connecting quantum gravitational collapse, and the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>From Bjorken Scaling to Scaling Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper traces the historical and conceptual journey from Bjorken scaling to the discovery of scaling violations in deep inelastic scattering, culminating in the development of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Beginning with the challenges faced by early strong interaction theories in the 1950s, we explore the emergence of agnostic approaches such as the bootstrap philosophy and current algebra, which sought to describe hadronic phenomena without relying on specific field theories. The pivotal role of experimental results from SLAC in the late 1960s is highlighted, leading to Bjorken's proposal of scaling in deep inelastic scattering and Feynman's parton model. We then delve into the theoretical breakthroughs of the 1970s, including Wilson's operator product expansion and the renormalization group, which provided the framework for understanding scaling violations. The discovery of asymptotic freedom in non-Abelian gauge theories by Gross, Wilczek, and Politzer marked a turning point, establishing QCD as the theory of strong interactions. Finally, we discuss the formulation of the Altarelli-Parisi equations, which elegantly describe the evolution of parton distribution functions and scaling violations, and their profound impact on the study of hard processes in particle physics. This paper not only recounts the key developments but also reflects on the interplay between theory and experiment that drove the field forward.</description>

      <title>Eye of the vortex: bound spectra in tunable horizonless rotational analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments are making remarkable strides in unveiling both the classical and quantum nature of black holes. By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the bound spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we utilize an analog vortex endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the spacetime of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon--characteristic of an acoustic black hole--for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the latter case, where the vortex flow is purely rotational, and compute the spectral properties of the analog system. The resulting bound-state spectrum is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of superfluid Helium giant quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime geometry used here holds significant potential to replicate the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the physical topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network Approach to Quark-Antiquark Color Flux Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINNs) framework for modelling the spatial distribution of chromodynamic fields induced by quark-antiquark pairs, based on lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to conventional neural networks, PINNs incorporate physical laws--expressed here as differential equations governing type-II superconductivity--directly into the training objective. By embedding these equations into the loss function, we guide the network to learn physically consistent solutions. Adopting an inverse problem approach, we extract the parameters of the superconducting equations from lattice QCD data and subsequently solve them. To accommodate physical boundary conditions, we recast the system into an integro-differential form and extend the analysis within the fractional PINNs framework. The accuracy of the reconstructed field distribution is assessed via relative $L_2$-error norms. We further extract physical observables such as the string tension and the mean width of the flux tube, offering quantitative insight into the confinement mechanism. This method enables the reconstruction of colour field profiles as functions of quark-antiquark separation without recourse to predefined parametric models. Our results illuminate aspects of the dual Meissner effect and highlight the promise of data-driven strategies in addressing non-perturbative challenges in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We write down an effective theory of the Polyakov loop to investigate the deconfinement phase transition of imaginary-rotating gluonic matter using the strong-coupling expansion. We find the strength of the nearest-neighbor Polyakov-loop interaction modified by the sum of contributions involving the chair-type loops along the temporal direction. Our results show that the deconfinement transition temperature increases with increasing imaginary angular velocity, which agrees with the predictions from the models and the high-temperature perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Axial quasi-normal modes of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity to second-order in spin and coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, including corrections up to second order in the black hole's dimensionless spin parameter ($\chi$) and second order in the dCS coupling parameter ($\alpha$). Due to the complexities of constructing a Newman-Penrose tetrad at this order, we employ a metric perturbation approach. We derive a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the primary axial $l$-mode and the polar $l\pm 1$ modes, which is then solved numerically with appropriate ingoing and outgoing wave boundary conditions. Our numerical framework is validated in the General Relativistic limit against known Schwarzschild QNMs and highly accurate Kerr QNM results for $\chi \leq 0.15$. For the fundamental $n=0, l=m=2$ axial mode, we present detailed numerical results illustrating the dependence of QNM frequencies on both $\chi$ and $\alpha$. We observe that while rotation generally increases the damping time, increasing the dCS coupling parameter significantly reduces the damping time of the axial mode. This finding contrasts with previous analytical work on polar modes, which suggested an increase in damping time due to dCS effects, highlighting a crucial parity-dependent difference in how dCS gravity impacts black hole ringdowns. Furthermore, we provide an analytical fitting formula for this mode. These results, incorporating coupled spin and dCS effects at second order, provide more accurate theoretical predictions for testing dCS gravity with gravitational wave observations of black hole ringdowns. The refined QNM calculations are particularly relevant for lower-mass black hole merger events, such as GW230529, where dCS corrections may be more prominent and their distinct damping signatures could be observable.

      <title>Event Topology Classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event classifiers are the most fundamental observables to probe the system size and event topology of high-energy collisions. Significant progress has been made to establish suitable event classifiers to probe different physics processes occurring in elementary $e^{+}e^{-}$ to heavy-ion collisions in a range of center of mass energies. One of the major motivations to revisit event classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) originates from the recent measurements of high multiplicity proton-proton collisions, which have revealed that these small collision systems exhibit features similar to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), traditionally believed to be only achievable in heavy nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. To pinpoint the origin of these QGP-like phenomena with substantially reduced auto-correlation and selection biases, and to bring all collision systems on equal footing, along with charged-particle multiplicity, lately several event topology classifiers such as transverse sphericity, transverse spherocity, relative transverse activity classifier, and charged-particle flattenicity have been used extensively in experiments as well as in the phenomenological front. In this review article, we extensively discuss the purpose, coverage, and usage guidelines of these event shape classifiers, which can be crucial given the upcoming measurements in a precision era during Runs 3 and 4 of the LHC. In most cases, the event shape observables are found to be better probes in understanding the heavy-ion-like behavior seen at the LHC, while making a multi-differential study of multihadron production dynamics in hadronic and nuclear collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss recent progress in the study of entanglement within cosmological frameworks, focusing on both momentum and position-space approaches and also reviewing the possibility to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields. Entanglement generation in expanding spacetimes can be traced back to the phenomenon of gravitational particle production, according to which the background gravitational field may transfer energy and momentum to quantum fields. The corresponding entanglement amount and its mode dependence are both sensitive to the field statistics and to the details of spacetime expansion, thus encoding information about the background. Gravitational production processes also play a key role in addressing the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations. In order to directly extract entanglement from quantum fields, local interactions with additional quantum systems, working as detectors, have been suggested, leading to the formulation of the entanglement harvesting protocol. Despite harvesting procedures are currently unfeasible from an experimental point of view, various proposals for implementation exist and a proper modeling of detectors and local interactions is crucial to address entanglement extraction via realistic setups. In the final part of the work, we address entanglement characterization in position space, primarily focusing on black hole spacetimes. We first investigate a possible interpretation of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy in terms of the entanglement entropy arising in discrete quantum field theories, on account of the area law. Then, we discuss the resolution of the black hole information paradox via the gravitational fine-grained entropy formula, which provides a new way to compute the entropy of Hawking radiation and allows to preserve unitarity in black hole evaporation processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that inflationary superhorizon fluctuations can be effectively described by a set of equations analogous to those governing a superfluid. This is achieved through a functional Schr\"odinger approach to the evolution of the inflationary wavefunction, combined with a suitable coarse-graining procedure to capture large-scale dynamics. The irrotational fluid velocity is proportional to the gradient of the wavefunction phase. Marginalizing over short superhorizon modes introduces an external force acting on the fluid velocity. The quantum pressure characteristic of the superfluid plays a role in scenarios involving an ultra-slow-roll phase of inflation. Our superfluid framework is consistent with the standard Starobinsky approach to stochastic inflation while offering complementary insights, particularly by providing more precise information on the phase of the inflationary wavefunction. We also discuss a heuristic approach to include dissipative effects in this description.</description>

Abstract: We develop a classification of general Carrollian structures, permitting affine connections with both torsion and non-metricity. We compare with a recent classification of general Galilean structures in order to present a unified perspective on both. Moreover, we demonstrate how both sets of structures emerge from the most general possible Lorentzian structures in their respective limits, and we highlight the role of global hyperbolicity in constraining both structures. We then leverage this work in order to construct for the first time an ultra-relativistic geometric trinity of gravitational theories, and consider connections which are simultaneously compatible with Galilean and Carrollian structures. We close by outlining a number of open questions and future prospects.</description>

Abstract: Given that black holes are ubiquitous in the universe and axion-like scalar fields are potential candidates for dark energy and/or dark matter, it is natural to consider cosmological black holes endowed with axion hair. We investigate the photon quasinormal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole with axion hair where the electromagnetic field is coupled to the axion field via a Chern-Simons interaction. We derive the master equations for the electromagnetic field as a set of coupled equations for parity-even and parity-odd modes and numerically compute quasinormal modes by using Leaver's continued fraction method. We find parity violation in the polarization of photons within the quasinormal mode spectrum. This parity violation in electromagnetic signals could serve as a new probe to explore the nature of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the reduced density matrix and entanglement entropies using autoregressive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an application of autoregressive neural networks to Monte Carlo simulations of quantum spin chains using the correspondence with classical two-dimensional spin systems. We use a hierarchy of neural networks capable of estimating conditional probabilities of consecutive spins to evaluate elements of reduced density matrices directly. Using the Ising chain as an example, we calculate the continuum limit of the ground state's von Neumann and R\'enyi bipartite entanglement entropies of an interval built of up to 5 spins. We demonstrate that our architecture is able to estimate all the needed matrix elements with just a single training for a fixed time discretization and lattice volume. Our method can be applied to other types of spin chains, possibly with defects, as well as to estimating entanglement entropies of thermal states at non-zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Torsional Regularization of Self-Energy and Bare Mass of Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of spacetime torsion, the momentum components do not commute; therefore, in quantum field theory, summation over the momentum eigenvalues will replace integration over the momentum. In the Einstein--Cartan theory of gravity, in which torsion is coupled to spin, the separation between the eigenvalues increases with the magnitude of the momentum. Consequently, this replacement regularizes divergent integrals in Feynman diagrams with loops by turning them into convergent sums. In this article, we apply torsional regularization to the self-energy of a charged lepton in quantum electrodynamics. We show that torsion eliminates the ultraviolet divergence of the standard self-energy. We also show that the infrared divergence is absent. In the end, we calculate the finite bare masses of the electron, muon, and tau lepton: $0.4329\,\mbox{MeV}$, $90.95\,\mbox{MeV}$, and $1543\,\mbox{MeV}$, respectively. These values constitute about $85\%$ of the observed, re-normalized masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Einstein-Cartan theory with the tetrad $e_{\mu}^{a}$ and spin connection $\omega_{\mu ab}$ taken as being independent fields. Diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance result in there being two distinct gauge transformations in this approach, and consequently two ghost fields arise when employing the usual Faddeev-Popov quantization procedure. Our choice of gauge fixing retains the gauge invariances of the background field. We show that the gauge algebra is closed even in the presence of torsion, and the resulting BRST invariance can be found for the effective action. We also derive the Slavnov-Taylor identities, which reflect the BRST symmetries of this theory.</description>

      <title>NCoder -- A Quantum Field Theory approach to encoding data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to interpretable AI inspired by Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which we call the NCoder. The NCoder is a modified autoencoder neural network whose latent layer is prescribed to be a subset of $n$-point correlation functions. Regarding images as draws from a lattice field theory, this architecture mimics the task of perturbatively constructing the effective action of the theory order by order in an expansion using Feynman diagrams. Alternatively, the NCoder may be regarded as simulating the procedure of statistical inference whereby high dimensional data is first summarized in terms of several lower dimensional summary statistics (here the $n$-point correlation functions), and subsequent out-of-sample data is generated by inferring the data generating distribution from these statistics. In this way the NCoder suggests a fascinating correspondence between perturbative renormalizability and the sufficiency of models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the NCoder by applying it to the generation of MNIST images, and find that generated images can be correctly classified using only information from the first three $n$-point functions of the image distribution.</description>

Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity action is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl conformal geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids century-old criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry, that ignored its gauge symmetry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: a) Weyl gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and Einstein-Hilbert gravity and Riemannian geometry are recovered, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; b) this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical (Weyl) gauge boson ($\omega_\mu$); c) all fields and masses have geometric origin (with no added scalar fields); d) the theory has a Weyl gauge invariant geometric regularisation (by $\hat R$) in $d$ dimensions and it is Weyl-anomaly free; this anomaly is recovered in the broken phase after massive $\omega_\mu$ decouples; e) the theory is the leading order of the general Weyl gauge invariant Dirac-Born-Infeld (WDBI) action of Weyl conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions; f) in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity; g) finally, Standard Model (SM) has a natural embedding in conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry generates a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, given by Weyl quadratic gravity, and leads to a unified description, by the gauge principle, of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM interactions.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the four-graviton scattering amplitude in Type II superstring theory at one loop up to seventh order in the low-energy expansion through the recently developed iterated integral formalism of Modular Graph Functions (MGFs). The machinery of the novel method allows us to propose a general form of the amplitude, which suggests that the expansion is expressible in terms of single-valued multiple zeta values and logarithmic derivatives of the Riemann zeta function at positive and negative odd integers. Furthermore, we comment on the transcendental behavior of the amplitude.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a black hole solution within the Einstein Maxwell framework incorporating a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci tensor and the Maxwell field strength tensor, using a perturbative approach. We subsequently explore the thermodynamic phase transitions of the black hole in an extended phase space, analyzing both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Our findings reveal that the system exhibits Van der Waals like behavior in both ensembles. Moreover, for sufficiently small values of electric charge and Maxwell potential, the thermodynamics is dominated by a Hawking Page phase transition.</description>

      <title>Large charge operators at large spin from relativistically rotating vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ground states of CFTs with a global $U(1)$ symmetry on $\mathbb{R}\times S^2$ in the regime of large charge $Q$ and large angular momentum $J$, using large charge EFT. We find that in the range $Q \ll J \ll Q^2$, the ground state solution is a superfluid densely populated with vortices rotating at a constant angular velocity $\Omega$. This is a relativistic generalization of the known (non-relativistic) rigid rotation phase, which corresponds to the small $\Omega$ limit of our solution. In the regime $Q^{3/2}\ll J\ll Q^2$, our solution achieves lower energy than previously identified states. In this regime, most of the vortices move near the speed of light, and we obtain the chiral fluctuation modes propagating at the speed of light. Interestingly, we find that our ground state can be interpreted as a zero temperature charged normal fluid rotating at a constant angular velocity $\Omega$. We rederive this solution purely from the fluid dynamics. Based on the (already established) applicability of fluid description to large non-supersymmetric extremal AdS black holes, we find that the boundary stress tensor and $U(1)$ current of extremal AdS Kerr-Newman black hole align with those of our solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of infinite-dimensional symmetries in the absence of gauge invariance by analyzing massless scalar theories. We construct an infinite tower of charges that arise from the subleading equations of motion at null infinity and are built from specific combinations of asymptotic field coefficients. Interestingly, these expressions are finite from the outset, requiring no holographic renormalization. By carefully analyzing the dynamics at spatial infinity, we show that this tower of surface integrals commutes with the S-matrix of the interacting model. As an application, we demonstrate that these symmetries lead to an infinite set of subleading soft relations, valid at leading order in a cubic interaction with massive scalar fields.</description>

      <title>On the CFT dual of superstring on AdS$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the proposed duality between superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ with pure NS-NS flux and a deformed symmetric orbifold CFT. We extract the residues of 3-point string correlators at their next-to-leading poles, which can be expressed as integrals. Because of picture changing, the integrand is not unique. We make an ansatz for its proper form which linearly combines three different picture choices. On the CFT side, we obtain the corresponding residues by doing a conformal perturbation computation at the second order. The result can also be expressed as integrals, with the integrand being a five point function in the symmetric orbifold theory, which is calculated using covering maps. After unifying the integration variables of the two sides, we find that the two integrands match precisely, due to some novel mathematical identities of covering maps. Our calculation verifies the proposed marginal operator in the dual CFT of superstring on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times\mathbb{T}^4$ and could be generalized to the CFT duals of superstrings on general backgrounds AdS$_3\times X$ with few modifications.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Quantum Criticality in Various Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Yang-Lee universality class arises when imaginary magnetic field is tuned to its critical value in the paramagnetic phase of the $d&lt;6$ Ising model. In $d=2$, this non-unitary Conformal Field Theory (CFT) is exactly solvable via the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. As found long ago by von Gehlen using Exact Diagonalization, the corresponding real-time, quantum critical behavior arises in the periodic Ising spin chain when the imaginary longitudinal magnetic field is tuned to its critical value from below. Even though the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, the energy levels are real due to the $PT$ symmetry. In this paper, we explore the analogous quantum critical behavior in higher dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians on regularized spheres $S^{d-1}$. For $d=3$, we use the recently invented, powerful fuzzy sphere method, as well as discretization by the platonic solids cube, icosahedron and dodecaherdron. The low-lying energy levels and structure constants we find are in agreement with expectations from the conformal symmetry. The energy levels are in good quantitative agreement with the high-temperature expansions and with Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the $6-\epsilon$ expansions in Fisher's $i\phi^3$ Euclidean field theory for the Yang-Lee criticality. In the course of this work, we clarify some aspects of matching between operators in this field theory and quasiprimary fields in the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. For $d=4$, we obtain new results by replacing the $S^3$ with the self-dual polytope called the $24$-cell.</description>

Abstract: The Cardy-Rabinovici model is a toy model of the lattice $U(1)$ gauge theories to study various oblique confinement states associated with the nonzero $\theta$ angles. We reformulate the $2$d version of this model using the modified Villain lattice formalism, and we establish the exact $\theta$ periodicity for the Witten effect and the strong-weak duality at the finite lattice spacings. We then study the phase structure of this model based on the duality, symmetry and anomaly, and the perturbative renormalization group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of high-energy degrees of freedom along the renormalization group (RG) flow in Poincar\'e-invariant theories can be captured by a monotonic c-function. For such theories, holographic monotonic c-functions have been constructed using entanglement entropy. However, in theories with broken Lorentz invariance, such constructions generally fail, reflecting both the violation of the entanglement RG monotonicity and its limitations in capturing certain properties of non-relativistic RG flows. Since many quantum many-body systems lack Lorentz invariance, it is of significant importance to identify a quantity that reflects the decrease in degrees of freedom along non-relativistic RG flows. We show that the recently introduced holographic timelike entanglement entropy naturally gives rise to a new c-function applicable to all such theories. We further demonstrate the existence of this c-function in theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling-violating fixed points, showing that, provided the null energy conditions and thermodynamic stability are satisfied, the proposed c-function exhibits the expected monotonic behavior along the RG flow.</description>

      <title>Chaos in the holographic matrix models for meson and baryon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of chaos has become a bridge connecting gravity theory and quantum field theory, especially within the framework of gauge-gravity duality. In this work, we study holographically the chaos in the matrix models for meson and baryon, which are derived from the $\mathrm{D4}/\mathrm{D6}/\overline{\mathrm{D6}}$ approach as a top-down holographic model for QCD. Since these matrix models can be simplified into coupled oscillator models with special parameters, we analyze the chaos in the resultant coupled oscillators. In the analysis of the classical chaos, we calculate numerically the orbits on the Poincar\'e section, the Lyapunov exponent as a function of the total energy and derive the large $N_{c}$ behavior analytically, then discuss the possible phase structure both in the mesonic and baryonic matrix models. These analyses suggest that chaos might serve as an order parameter to detect the gauge theory with spontaneous breaking or restoration of symmetry. Besides, in the analysis of the quantum chaos, we demonstrate the numerical calculation of the OTOCs and analytically derive their large $N_{c}$ behavior by using the perturbation method in quantum mechanics. The numerical calculation illustrates there is a critical temperature, as a critical energy scale, that the OTOC begins to saturate, which covers qualitatively the classical analysis of the Lyapunov exponent. And the large $N_{c}$ analytics indicates the OTOCs are suppressed by the growth of $N_{c}$. Overall, the investigation of chaos in this work may be helpful to identify common features shared by the matrix models, hadronic physics, gauge theory, quantum mechanics, and gravity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the duality between the gravitating $c=1$ (compact) Sine-Gordon model and a normal matrix model. From a two-dimensional quantum gravity perspective and due to the periodic nature of the potential, this model admits both anti-de Sitter and de-Sitter saddles, similarly to simpler models of Sine-Dilaton gravity, as well as more complicated interpolating "wineglass wormhole" geometries. From a string theory perspective the Euclidean de-Sitter (genus zero) saddles are related to the presence of a classical entropic contribution associated to the target space geometry. The gravitating Sine-Gordon model corresponds to a well defined CFT by construction and the eigenvalues of the dual normal matrix model are supported in a compact region of the complex plane. The duality with the normal matrix model is operationally defined even for a finite, but sufficiently large matrix size $N$, depending on the precise observable to be determined. We define and study a "microscopic" version of the large-N limit that allows us to recover non-perturbative results for all physical observables.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonians for Periodic Free Fermion Chains with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the half system entanglement Hamiltonians of the ground state of free fermion critical transverse field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of defects. In general, we observe that these defects introduce non-local terms into the entanglement Hamiltonian, with the most significant being couplings across the defect that decay with distance. We also perform a limited entanglement Hamiltonian reconstruction using an ansatz and analyze how the fitted non-local couplings vary with defect strength.</description>

      <title>Extended $\delta N$ formalism: Nonspatially Flat Separate Universe Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful approach to compute non-linearly the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$. It assumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all the gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models beyond slow-roll. In this Letter, we extend the formalism to capture these gradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature contribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this formalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly describe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from the horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phenomenology of Identified Particle Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions at LHC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Zubarev approach of the non-equilibrium statistical operator to investigate the enhancement of the low-$p_T$ region of pion spectra, introducing an effective pion chemical potential to describe the overpopulation of low-energy pion states. We test a corresponding freeze-out approach by analyzing the transverse-momentum spectra of identified particles measured recently with high precision by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN LHC. A blast-wave model and a blast-wave-based particle generator, coupled to a hadronic transport model, are utilized. Bayesian inference methods are applied to extract the most probable sets of thermodynamic parameters at the chemical freeze-out hypersurface. Both models for the overpopulated pion states, the hadronic transport model and the thermal model with a nonzero pion chemical potential, provide a satisfactory description of the observed pion spectra. However, both approaches contain approximations which can be improved within a systematic nonequilibrium approach. We demonstrate that the introduction of a nonequilibrium pion chemical potential offers an efficient alternative to the conventional explanation of the low-$p_T$ enhancement, typically attributed to resonance decays with subsequent thermalization. A similar discussion holds also for the kaon spectra.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of Charges and Differential Equations Solved by Polynomials II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in (Igor Loutsenko, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37, 1309, 2004). Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: Non-smooth Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation are constructed. The construction occurs in a finite periodic volume $\mathbb{T}^3$. The entropyp roduction maximizing solutions are selected.
  Part I of this paper defines the entropy principle and using it, finds improved regularity for the Navier-Stokes solutions.
  Part II concerns initial data and its achievability as a limit of the small time data.
  Part III establishes analyticity properties of the Part II solution; Part IV demonstrates blowup in finite time.</description>

      <title>Modular domain walls and gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss modular domain walls and gravitational waves in a class of supersymmetric models where quark and lepton flavour symmetry emerges from modular symmetry. In such models a single modulus field $\tau$ is often assumed to be stabilised at or near certain fixed point values such as $\tau = {\rm i}$ and $\tau = \omega$ (the cube root of unity), in its fundamental domain. We show that, in the global supersymmetry limit of certain classes of potentials, the vacua at these fixed points may be degenerate, leading to the formation of modular domain walls in the early Universe. Taking supergravity effects into account, in the background of a fixed dilaton field $S$, the degeneracy may be lifted, leading to a bias term in the potential allowing the domain walls to collapse. We study the resulting gravitational wave spectra arising from the dynamics of such modular domain walls, and assess their observability by current and future experiments, as a window into modular flavour symmetry.</description>

      <title>Generalized Statistics on Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eccentric binary compact mergers are prime targets of current and future gravitational wave observatories. In the small mass ratio expansion, post-adiabatic inspirals have been modeled up to the separatrix, where first-principle modeling currently ends. In this paper, we derive the analytic late time solution to the adiabatic inspiral in terms of self-force coefficients at the separatrix. We identify the role of the Lambert $W_{-1}$ function as a key mathematical ingredient in the approach to the separatrix.</description>

      <title>Entropy flow in a parametric amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computations of entropy in thermodynamics rely on discreteness of the spectra of the subsystems. We argue that, for cases with continuous spectra (typically, radiation), there is a useful definition of entropy flow based on discretizing the signal into Gabor's "atoms," say, by means of a windowed Fourier transform. In particular, applying this method to a parametric amplifier (paramp) driven by a classical pump and coupled to a zero-temperature Markovian bath, we find that the output entropy flux vanishes at large times, even though the energy and photon number fluxes remain nonzero. This is consistent with the manner in which the paramp is expected to release information about its initial state. We relate the quenching of the entropy flow to development of the off-diagonal coherences in the output and discuss possible relevance of this mechanism to the black-hole information problem. We also propose to use measurements of the off-diagonal coherences as a means of extracting the rates at which high-entropy subsystems release information to linear environments.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Improving thermal state preparation of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with reinforcement learning on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, known for its strong quantum correlations and chaotic behavior, serves as a key platform for quantum gravity studies. However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems ($N&gt;12$, where $N$ is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems $N\geq12$ compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work advances a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for quantum gravity studies and out-of-time-ordered thermal correlators computation in quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware. The code is available at https://github.com/Aqasch/solving_SYK_model_with_RL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the null geodesic equation for photons is modified in the presence of a charged scalar field, with quantum fluctuations acting as an effective mass term that changes the null paths to timelike curves. This effect can be interpreted as a vacuum polarization phenomenon in curved spacetime. The resulting contribution to the Sachs-Wolfe effect varies with photon frequency, leading to frequency-dependent corrections to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody spectrum in the form of a $\mu$-distortion, as well as modifications to the CMB power spectrum. We estimate these within a standard inflationary scenario and find that while the correction to the CMB power spectrum is significant when the scalar field is light, the magnitude of the $\mu$-distortion depends strongly on the regularization prescription.</description>

      <title>Global monopole in a Ricci-coupled Kalb-Ramond bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate black hole solutions in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (EKR) bumblebee gravity sourced by a global monopole characterized by the charge $\eta$. This modified theory of gravity possesses the notable feature of incorporating local Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) via a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism. We solve the field equations for a static and spherically symmetric metric with the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field fixed at its VEV, thereby obtaining new black hole solutions. These solutions simultaneously exhibit the LSB effects, codified by the $\gamma$ parameter, and the global monopole effects, codified by the charge $\eta$. Next, we study the impact of the global monopole and LSB corrections on two classical tests, namely, the advance of Mercury's perihelion and the light deflection. Furthermore, we compute the Hawking temperature, black hole shadows, and greybody factors. Ultimately, we estimate an upper bound for $\eta$ by comparing the theoretical results provided by the EKR model with observational data from the advance of Mercury's perihelion and light deflection.</description>

      <title>Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions restricts scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from the ones of General Relativity (GR). Imposing that some such solutions$\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated in the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\unicode{x2013}$should exist, the space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate precisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic higher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is given by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant kinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under which the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR solutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of theories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear odd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly, we find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in particular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation of a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via companion $\texttt {Mathematica}$ notebooks.</description>

Abstract: Studies regarding extra-dimensions have been of great interest in modern theoretical physics, including their observational consequences from future gravitational wave (GW) observatories. In this direction, extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), attracting considerable interest in GW astronomy and fundamental physics, can potentially provide a useful platform for the search of extra dimensions. In this paper, we examine a rotating braneworld black hole in the context of equatorial eccentric EMRI and attempt to provide an order of magnitude analysis for the extra-dimensional parameter termed "tidal charge". We estimate GW fluxes for the dominant mode and determine the impact of the tidal charge parameter on the orbital evolution. We further evaluate the prospects of detecting such a parameter through mismatch computation. We observe a significant enhancement in the mismatch as the value of orbital eccentricity or tidal charge parameter increases; the phenomenon becomes more obvious for rapidly rotating massive black holes. Thus, the study suggests that eccentric EMRI can potentially probe the existence of extra dimensions with future low-frequency detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <title>Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386</link>

Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with Planck legacy data and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then investigate the connection between power suppression and alleviation of lensing anomaly and show that lensing anomaly is mitigated the most in models with maximum suppression of power at low multipoles. We also analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. These results are further analyzed in the light of Planck Release 4 data using \texttt{CamSpec}, \texttt{HiLLiPoP} and \texttt{LoLLiPoP} likelihoods in which departure of lensing parameter from one is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models and to settle the issue. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</description>
