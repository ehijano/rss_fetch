      <title>Survey on the Canonical Metrics on the Teichm\"{u}ller Spaces and the Moduli Spaces of Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis results from an intensive study on the canonical metrics on the Teichm\"{u}ller spaces and the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. There are several renowned classical metrics on $T_g$ and $\mathcal{M}_g$, including the Weil-Petersson metric, the Teichm\"{u}ller metric, the Kobayashi metric, the Bergman metric, the Carath\'{e}odory metric and the K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric. The Teichm\"{u}ller metric, the Kobayashi metric and the Carath\'{e}odory metric are only (complete) Finsler metrics, but they are effective tools in the study of hyperbolic property of $\mathcal{M}_g$. The Weil-Petersson metric is an incomplete K\"{a}hler metric, while the Bergman metric and the K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric are complete K\"{a}hler metrics. However, McMullen introduced a new complete K\"{a}hler metric, called the McMullen metric, by perturbing the Weil-Petersson metric. This metric is indeed equivalent to the Teichm\"{u}ller metric. Recently, Liu-Sun-Yau proved that the equivalence of the K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric to the Teichm\"{u}ller metric, and hence gave a positive answer to a conjecture proposed by Yau. Their approach in the proof is to introduce two new complete K\"{a}hler metrics, namely, the Ricci metric and the perturbed Ricci metric, and then establish the equivalence of the Ricci metric to the K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric and the equivalence of the Ricci metric to the McMullen metric. The main purpose of this thesis is to survey the properties of these various metrics and the geometry of $T_g$ and $\mathcal{M}_g$ induced by these metrics.</description>

      <title>On manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and the infimum of volume growth order $&lt;2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two rigidity theorems for open (complete and noncompact) $n$-manifolds $M$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature and the infimum of volume growth order $&lt;2$. The first theorem asserts that the Riemannian universal cover of $M$ has Euclidean volume growth if and only if $M$ is flat with an $n-1$ dimensional soul. The second theorem asserts that there exists a nonconstant linear growth harmonic function on $M$ if and only if $M$ is isometric to the metric product $\mathbb{R}\times N$ for some compact manifold $N$.</description>

      <title>Covariant Schr\"odinger Operator and $L^2$-Vanishing Property on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold satisfying a weighted Poincar\'e inequality, and let $\mathcal{E}$ be a Hermitian vector bundle over $M$ equipped with a metric covariant derivative $\nabla$. We consider the operator $H_{X,V}=\nabla^{\dagger}\nabla+\nabla_{X}+ V$, where $\nabla^{\dagger}$ is the formal adjoint of $\nabla$ with respect to the inner product in the space of square-integrable sections of $\mathcal{E}$, $X$ is a smooth (real) vector field on $M$, and $V$ is a fiberwise self-adjoint, smooth section of the endomorphism bundle $\textrm{End }\mathcal{E}$. We give a sufficient condition for the triviality of the $L^2$-kernel of $H_{X,V}$. As a corollary, putting $X\equiv 0$ and working in the setting of a Clifford bundle equipped with a Clifford connection $\nabla$, we obtain the triviality of the $L^2$-kernel of $D^2$, where $D$ is the Dirac operator corresponding to $\nabla$. In particular, when $\mathcal{E}=\Lambda^{k}T^*M$ and $D^2$ is the Hodge--deRham Laplacian on $k$-forms, we recover some recent vanishing results for $L^2$-harmonic $k$-forms.</description>

      <title>Ancient mean curvature flows with finite total curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an $I$-family of ancient graphical mean curvature flows over a minimal hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of finite total curvature with the Morse index $I$ by establishing exponentially fast convergence in terms of $|x|^2-t$. As a corollary, we show that these ancient flows have finite total curvature and finite mass drop. Moreover, one family of these flows is mean convex by a pointwise estimate.</description>

      <title>Exterior stability of Minkowski spacetime with borderline decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1993, the global stability of Minkowski spacetime has been proven in the celebrated work of Christodoulou and Klainerman \cite{Ch-Kl}. In 2003, Klainerman and Nicol\`o \cite{Kl-Ni} revisited Minkowski stability in the exterior of an outgoing null cone. In \cite{Shen23}, the author extended the results of \cite{Ch-Kl} to minimal decay assumptions. In this paper, we prove that the exterior stability of Minkowski holds with decay which is borderline compared to the minimal decay considered in \cite{Shen23}.</description>

      <title>Higher spins and Finsler geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finsler geometry is a natural generalization of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry, where the line element is not the square root of a quadratic form but a more general homogeneous function. Parameterizing this in terms of symmetric tensors suggests a possible interpretation in terms of higher-spin fields. We will see here that, at linear level in these fields, the Finsler version of the Ricci tensor leads to the curved-space Fronsdal equation for all spins, plus a Stueckelberg-like coupling. Nonlinear terms can also be systematically analyzed, suggesting a possible interacting structure. No particular choice of spacetime dimension is needed. The Stueckelberg mechanism breaks gauge transformations to a redundancy that does not change the geometry. This is however not enough to eliminate non-transverse modes, at least for some versions of Finsler dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a K\"ahler manifold we consider the problems of maximizing/minimizing Monge--Amp\`ere energy over certain subsets of the space of K\"ahler potentials. Under suitable assumptions we prove that solutions to these variational problems exist, are unique, and have a simple characterization. We then use the extremals to construct hermitian metrics on holomorphic vector bundles, and investigate their curvature.</description>

      <title>Discretized Gradient Flow for Manifold Learning in the Space of Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.09057v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient descent, or negative gradient flow, is a standard technique in optimization to find minima of functions. Many implementations of gradient descent rely on discretized versions, i.e., moving in the gradient direction for a set step size, recomputing the gradient, and continuing. In this paper, we present an approach to manifold learning where gradient descent takes place in the infinite dimensional space $\mathcal{E} = {\rm Emb}(M,\mathbb{R}^N)$ of smooth embeddings $\phi$ of a manifold $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^N$. Implementing a discretized version of gradient descent for $P:\mathcal{E}\to {\mathbb R}$, a penalty function that scores an embedding $\phi \in \mathcal{E}$, requires estimating how far we can move in a fixed direction -- the direction of one gradient step -- before leaving the space of smooth embeddings. Our main result is to give an explicit lower bound for this step length in terms of the Riemannian geometry of $\phi(M)$. In particular, we consider the case when the gradient of $P$ is pointwise normal to the embedded manifold $\phi(M)$. We prove this case arises when $P$ is invariant under diffeomorphisms of $M$, a natural condition in manifold learning.</description>

Abstract: Weak almost contact manifolds, i.e., the linear complex structure on the contact distribution is approximated by a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor, defined by the author and R. Wolak (2022), allowed a new look at the theory of contact manifolds. This article studies the curvature and topology of new structures of this type, called the weak nearly cosymplectic structure and weak nearly K\"{a}hler structure. We find conditions under which weak nearly cosymplectic manifolds become Riemannian products and characterize 5-dimensional weak nearly cosymplectic manifolds. Our theorems generalize results by H. Endo (2005) and A. Nicola-G. Dileo-I. Yudin (2018) to the context of weak almost contact geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of paraquaternionic contact structures (pqc structures), which turns out to be a generalization of the para 3-Sasakian geometry. We derive a distinguished linear connection preserving the pqc structure. Its torsion tensor is expressed explicitly in terms of the structure tensors and the structure equations of a pqc manifold are presented. We define pqc-Einstein manifolds and show that para 3-Sasakian spaces are precisely pqc manifolds, which are pqc-Einstein. Furthermore, we introduce the paraquaternionic Heisenberg qroup and show that it is the flat model of the pqc geometry.</description>

Abstract: Superconvergence of differential structure on discretized surfaces is studied in this paper. The newly introduced geometric supercloseness provides us with a fundamental tool to prove the superconvergence of gradient recovery on deviated surfaces. An algorithmic framework for gradient recovery without exact geometric information is introduced. Several numerical examples are documented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds on the height of K-semistable Fano varieties I, the toric case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Fujita's algebro-geometric result that complex projective space has maximal degree among all K-semistable complex Fano varieties, we conjecture that the height of a K-semistable metrized arithmetic Fano variety X of relative dimension n is maximal when X is the projective space over the integers, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric. Our main result establishes the conjecture for the canonical integral model of a toric Fano variety when n is less than or equal to 6 (the extension to higher dimensions is conditioned on a conjectural "gap hypothesis" for the degree). Translated into toric K\"ahler geometry this result yields a sharp lower bound on a toric invariant introduced by Donaldson, defined as the minimum of the toric Mabuchi functional. We furthermore reformulate our conjecture as an optimal lower bound on Odaka's modular height. In any dimension n it is shown how to control the height of the canonical toric model X, with respect to the K\"ahler-Einstein metric, by the degree of X. In a sequel to this paper our height conjecture is established for any projective diagonal Fano hypersurface, by exploiting a more general logarithmic setup.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Gromov hyperbolic groups obtained by the strict hyperbolization procedure of Charney and Davis are virtually compact special, hence linear and residually finite. Our strategy consists in constructing an action of a hyperbolized group on a certain dual CAT(0) cubical complex. As a result, all the common applications of strict hyperbolization are shown to provide manifolds with virtually compact special fundamental group. In particular, we obtain examples of closed negatively curved Riemannian manifolds whose fundamental groups are linear and virtually algebraically fiber.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve the abundance conjecture for minimal projective klt varieties $X$ satisfying Miyaoka's equality $3c_2(X) = c_{1}(X)^{2}$. Specifically, we prove that the canonical divisor $K_{X}$ is semi-ample and the Kodaira dimension $\kappa(K_{X})$ is either $0$, $1$, or $2$. Moreover, according to the Kodaira dimension, we reveal the structure of the Iitaka fibration of $X$ up to quasi-\'etale covers. Additionally, we show similar results for projective klt varieties with nef anti-canonical divisor.</description>
