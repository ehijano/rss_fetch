      <title>Knots whose braided satellite have the same HOMFLY polynomial up to given $z$-degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given knot $K$ and $w&gt;0$, we construct infinitely many mutually distinct hyperbolic knots $\{K_i\}$ such that the $P$-satellites of $K$ and $K_i$ have the same HOMFLY polynomial up to given $z$-degrees, for all braided patterns $P$ with winding number less than or equal to $w$.</description>

      <title>Contractible Vietoris-Rips complexes of $\mathbb{Z}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new, short proof of a result of Virk, that the Vietoris-Rips complex of the group $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with the standard word metric is contractible at large enough scales. This is inspired by a key observation in Virk's proof, but we use Bestvina-Brady discrete Morse theory to get a very short proof with better bounds. In the course of this, we get a new, general criterion for a metric space to have contractible Vietoris-Rips complexes at large enough scales, which could prove useful in the future.</description>

      <title>New Exotic four-manifolds with $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ fundamental group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend a construction of Stipsicz-Szab\'{o} of infinitely many irreducible exotic smooth structures of some closed four-manifolds with even $b_2^+$ and fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We use the double node surgery and rational blow down constructions of Fintushel-Stern on some elliptic fibrations equipped with a free involution. The construction is done in an equivariant manner and the factor manifolds are distinguished by the Seiberg-Witten invariants of their universal covers.</description>

      <title>Locally flat simple spheres in $\mathbb{C} P^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental group of the complement of a locally flat surface in a $4$-manifold is called the knot group of the surface. In this article we prove that two locally flat $2$-spheres in $\mathbb{C} P^2$ with knot group $\mathbb{Z}_2$ are ambiently isotopic if they are homologous. This combines with work of Tristram and Lee-Wilczy\'{n}ski, as well as the classification of $\mathbb{Z}$-surfaces, to complete a proof of the statement: a class $d \in H_2(\mathbb{C} P^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ is represented by a locally flat $2$-sphere with abelian knot group if and only if $|d| \in \lbrace 0,1,2\rbrace$; and this sphere is unique up to ambient isotopy.</description>

      <title>The second coefficient of the Alexander polynomial as a satellite obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set L of links is introduced, containing positive braid links as well as arborescent positive Hopf plumbings. It is shown that for links in P, the leading and the second coefficient of the Alexander polynomial have opposite sign. It follows that certain satellite links, such as (n,1)-cables, are not in P.</description>

      <title>Non-split, alternating links bound unique Seifert surfaces in the 4-ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any two same-genus, oriented, boundary parallel surfaces bounded by a non-split, alternating link into the 4-ball are smoothly isotopic fixing boundary. In other words, any same-genus Seifert surfaces for a non-split, alternating link become smoothly isotopic fixing boundary once their interiors are pushed into the 4-ball. We conclude that a smooth surface in $S^4$ obtained by gluing two Seifert surfaces for a non-split alternating link is always smoothly unknotted.</description>

      <title>Topology of matching complexes of complete graphs via discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02973v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bouc (1992) first studied the topological properties of $M_n$, the matching complex of the complete graph of order $n$, in connection with Brown complexes and Quillen complexes. Bj\"{o}rner et al. (1994) showed that $M_n$ is homotopically $(\nu_n-1)$-connected, where $\nu_n=\lfloor{\frac{n+1}{3}}\rfloor-1$, and conjectured that this connectivity bound is sharp. Shareshian and Wachs (2007) settled the conjecture by inductively showing that the $\nu_n$-dimensional homology group of $M_n$ is nontrivial, with Bouc's calculation of $H_1(M_7)$ serving as the pivotal base step. In general, the topology of $M_n$ is not very well-understood, even for a small $n$. In the present article, we look into the topology of $M_n$, and $M_7$ in particular, in the light of discrete Morse theory as developed by Forman (1998). We first construct a gradient vector field on $M_n$ (for $n \ge 5$) that doesn't admit any critical simplices of dimension up to $\nu_n-1$, except one unavoidable $0$-simplex, which also leads to the aforementioned $(\nu_n-1)$-connectedness of $M_n$ in a purely combinatorial way. However, for an efficient homology computation by discrete Morse theoretic techniques, we are required to work with a gradient vector field that admits a low number of critical simplices, and also allows an efficient enumeration of gradient paths. An optimal gradient vector field is one with the least number of critical simplices, but the problem of finding an optimal gradient vector field, in general, is an NP-hard problem (even for $2$-dimensional complexes). We improve the gradient vector field constructed on $M_7$ in particular to a much more efficient (near-optimal) one, and then with the help of this improved gradient vector field, compute the homology groups of $M_7$ in an efficient and algorithmic manner. We also augment this near-optimal gradient vector field to one that we conjecture to be optimal.</description>

      <title>New Garside structures and applications to Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Garside groups are combinatorial generalizations of braid groups which enjoy many nice algebraic, geometric, and algorithmic properties. In this article we propose a method for turning the direct product of a group $G$ by $\mathbb{Z}$ into a Garside group, under simple assumptions on $G$. This method gives many new examples of Garside groups, including groups satisfying certain small cancellation condition (including surface groups) and groups with a systolic presentation.
  Our method also works for a large class of Artin groups, leading to many new group theoretic, geometric and topological consequences for them. In particular, we prove new cases of $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for some hyperbolic type Artin groups.</description>
