      <title>Decoupling for surfaces with radial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilise the two principles of decoupling introduced in [arXiv:2407.16108] to prove decoupling for two types of surfaces exhibiting radial symmetry. The first type are surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb R^n$ generated by smooth surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$. The second type of surfaces are graphs of trivariate homogeneous smooth functions of nonzero degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by virtue of a determinantal formula for derivatives of the ratio between two differentiable functions, in view of the Fa\`a di Bruno formula, and with the help of several identities and closed-form formulas for the partial Bell polynomials $\operatorname{B}_{n,k}$, the author establishes thirteen Maclaurin series expansions of the functions \begin{align*} &amp;\ln\frac{\operatorname{e}^x+1}{2}, &amp;&amp; \ln\frac{\operatorname{e}^x-1}{x}, &amp;&amp; \ln\cosh x, \\ &amp;\ln\frac{\sinh x}{x}, &amp;&amp; \biggl[\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}\biggr]^r, &amp;&amp; \biggl(\frac{\operatorname{e}^x-1}{x}\biggr)^r \end{align*} for $r=\pm\frac{1}{2}$ and $r\in\mathbb{R}$ in terms of the Dirichlet eta function $\eta(1-2k)$, the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(1-2k)$, and the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds $s(n,k)$ and $S(n,k)$. presents four determinantal expressions and three recursive relations for the Bernoulli numbers $B_{2n}$.  finds out three closed-form formulas for the Bernoulli numbers $B_{2n}$ and the generalized Bernoulli numbers $B_n^{(r)}$ in terms of the Stirling numbers of the second kind $S(n,k)$, and deduce two combinatorial identities for the Stirling numbers of the second kind $S(n,k)$. acquires two combinatorial identities, which can be regarded as diagonal recursive relations, involving the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds $s(n,k)$ and $S(n,k)$. recovers an integral representation and a closed-form formula, and establish an alternative explicit and closed-form formula, for the Bernoulli numbers of the second kind $b_n$ in terms of the Stirling numbers of the first kind $s(n,k)$. obtains three identities connecting the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds $s(n,k)$ and $S(n,k)$.</description>

      <title>Period Function of Maass forms from Ramanujan's Lost Notebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lost Notebook of Ramanujan contains a number of beautiful formulas, one of which can be found on its page 220. It involves an interesting function, which we denote as $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$. In this paper, we show that $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ belongs to the category of period functions as it satisfies the period relations of Maass forms in the sense of Lewis and Zagier \cite{lz}. Hence, we refer to $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ as the \emph{Ramanujan period function}. Moreover, one of the salient aspects of the Ramanujan period function $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ that we found out is that it is a Hecke eigenfunction under the action of Hecke operators on the space of periods. We also establish that it naturally appears in a Kronecker limit formula of a certain zeta function, revealing its connections to various topics. Finally, we generalize $\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ to include a parameter $s,$ connecting our work to the broader theory of period functions developed by Bettin and Conrey \cite{bc} and Lewis and Zagier \cite{lz}. We emphasize that Ramanujan was the first to study this function, marking the beginning of the study of period functions.</description>

      <title>Widom factors in $\mathbb C^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the theory of Widom factors to the $\mathbb C^n$ setting. We define Widom factors of compact subsets $K\subset \mathbb C^n$ associated with multivariate orthogonal polynomials and weighted Chebyshev polynomials. We show that on product subsets $K=K_1\times\cdots\times K_n$ of $\mathbb C^n$, where each $K_j$ is a non-polar compact subset of $\mathbb C$, these quantities have universal lower bounds which directly extend one dimensional results. Under the additional assumption that each $K_j$ is a subset of the real line, we provide improved lower bounds for Widom factors for some weight functions $w$; in particular, for the case $w\equiv 1$. Finally, we define the Mahler measure of a multivariate polynomial relative to $K\subset \mathbb C^n$ and obtain lower bounds for this quantity on product sets.</description>

      <title>No infinite spin for partial collisions converging to isolated central configurations on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the $n$-body problem, when a~cluster of bodies tends to a collision, then its normalized shape curve converges to the set of normalized central configurations, which has $SO(2)$ symmetry in the planar case. This leaves a possibility that the normalized shape curve tends to the circle obtained by rotation of some central configuration instead of a particular point on it. This is the \emph{infinite spin problem} which concerns the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the $n$-body problem. The question also makes sense for partial collision.
  We show that the infinite spin is not possible if the limiting circle is isolated from other connected components of the set of normalized central configurations. Our approach extends the method from recent work for total collision by Moeckel and Montgomery, which was based on a combination of the center manifold theorem with {\L}ojasiewicz inequality. To that we add a shadowing result for pseudo-orbits near normally hyperbolic manifold and careful estimates on the influence of other bodies on the cluster of colliding bodies.</description>
