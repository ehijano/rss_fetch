      <title>LLM-Based Instance-Driven Heuristic Bias In the Context of a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) within metaheuristics opens a novel path for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. While most existing approaches leverage LLMs for code generation to create or refine specific heuristics, they often overlook the structural properties of individual problem instances. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates LLMs with a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to solve the NP-hard Longest Run Subsequence problem. Our approach extends the instance-driven heuristic bias paradigm by introducing a human-LLM collaborative process to co-design and implement a set of computationally efficient metrics. The LLM analyzes these instance-specific metrics to generate a tailored heuristic bias, which steers the BRKGA toward promising areas of the search space. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation, including rigorous statistical tests, convergence and behavioral analyses, and targeted ablation studies, comparing our method against a standard BRKGA baseline across 1,050 generated instances of varying complexity. Results show that our top-performing hybrid, BRKGA+Llama-4-Maverick, achieves statistically significant improvements over the baseline, particularly on the most complex instances. Our findings confirm that leveraging an LLM to produce an a priori, instance-driven heuristic bias is a valuable approach for enhancing metaheuristics in complex optimization domains.</description>

      <title>Predictive Spike Timing Enables Distributed Shortest Path Computation in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient planning and sequence selection are central to intelligence, yet current approaches remain largely incompatible with biological computation. Classical graph algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* require global state and biologically implausible operations such as backtracing, while reinforcement learning methods rely on slow gradient-based policy updates that appear inconsistent with rapid behavioral adaptation observed in natural systems.
  We propose a biologically plausible algorithm for shortest-path computation that operates through local spike-based message-passing with realistic processing delays. The algorithm exploits spike-timing coincidences to identify nodes on optimal paths: Neurons that receive inhibitory-excitatory message pairs earlier than predicted reduce their response delays, creating a temporal compression that propagates backwards from target to source. Through analytical proof and simulations on random spatial networks, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges and discovers all shortest paths using purely timing-based mechanisms. By showing how short-term timing dynamics alone can compute shortest paths, this work provides new insights into how biological networks might solve complex computational problems through purely local computation and relative spike-time prediction. These findings open new directions for understanding distributed computation in biological and artificial systems, with possible implications for computational neuroscience, AI, reinforcement learning, and neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Integrative Variational Autoencoders for Generative Modeling of an Image Outcome with Multiple Input Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding relationships across multiple imaging modalities is central to neuroimaging research. We introduce the Integrative Variational Autoencoder (InVA), the first hierarchical VAE framework for image-on-image regression in multimodal neuroimaging. Unlike standard VAEs, which are not designed for predictive integration across modalities, InVA models outcome images as functions of both shared and modality-specific features. This flexible, data-driven approach avoids rigid assumptions of classical tensor regression and outperforms conventional VAEs and nonlinear models such as BART. As a key application, InVA accurately predicts costly PET scans from structural MRI, offering an efficient and powerful tool for multimodal neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Deep Survival Analysis from Adult and Pediatric Electrocardiograms: A Multi-center Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17002v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence applied to electrocardiography (AI-ECG) shows potential for mortality prediction, but heterogeneous approaches and private datasets have limited generalizable insights. To address this, we systematically evaluated model design choices across three large cohorts: Beth Israel Deaconess (MIMIC-IV: n = 795,546 ECGs, United States), Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (Code-15: n = 345,779, Brazil), and Boston Children's Hospital (BCH: n = 255,379, United States). We evaluated models predicting all-cause mortality, comparing horizon-based classification and deep survival methods with neural architectures including convolutional networks and transformers, benchmarking against demographic-only and gradient boosting baselines. Top models performed well (median concordance: Code-15, 0.83; MIMIC-IV, 0.78; BCH, 0.81). Incorporating age and sex improved performance across all datasets. Classifier-Cox models showed site-dependent sensitivity to horizon choice (median Pearson's R: Code-15, 0.35; MIMIC-IV, -0.71; BCH, 0.37). External validation reduced concordance, and in some cases demographic-only models outperformed externally trained AI-ECG models on Code-15. However, models trained on multi-site data outperformed site-specific models by 5-22%. Findings highlight factors for robust AI-ECG deployment: deep survival methods outperformed horizon-based classifiers, demographic covariates improved predictive performance, classifier-based models required site-specific calibration, and cross-cohort training, even between adult and pediatric cohorts, substantially improved performance. These results emphasize the importance of model type, demographics, and training diversity in developing AI-ECG models reliably applicable across populations.</description>
