      <title>Calibrating chemical mixing induced by internal gravity waves based on hydrodynamical simulations; The chemical evolution of OB-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves (IGWs) have been shown to contribute to the transport of chemical elements in stars with a convective core and radiative envelope. Recent 2D hydrodynamical simulations of convection in intermediate-mass stars have provided estimates of the chemical mixing efficiency of such waves. The chemical diffusion coefficient from IGW mixing is described by a constant A times the squared wave velocity. The value of A, however, remains unconstrained by such simulations. This work aims at investigating what values A can take in order to reproduce the observed nitrogen surface abundances of the most nitrogen-enriched massive stars. Furthermore, we discuss the prevalence of IGW mixing compared to rotational mixing. We provide an implementation of these mixing profiles predicted from hydrodynamical simulations in the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We compute evolution tracks for stars between 3 and 30Msun with this new implementation for IGW mixing and study the evolution for the surface abundances of isotopes involved in the CNO cycle, particularly the N14 isotope. We show that this 1D framework predicting the chemical diffusion coefficient from IGW mixing yields consistent morphologies of the mixing profile in comparison with hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the value of A must increase with mass in order to reproduce the most nitrogen-enriched stars. Assuming these calibrated values for A, mixing by IGWs is a potential mechanism to reproduce well-mixed stars without needing rapid rotation. We have provided observational limits on the efficiency of IGW mixing for future theoretical studies. Future asteroseismic modelling efforts taking IGW mixing into account will be able to place additional constraints on the convective core mass, as our models predict that the convective core should be significantly more massive if IGW mixing is indeed efficient.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are a few different mechanisms that can cause white dwarf stars to vary in brightness, providing opportunities to probe the physics, structures, and formation of these compact stellar remnants. The observational characteristics of the three most common types of white dwarf variability are summarized: stellar pulsations, rotation, and ellipsoidal variations from tidal distortion in binary systems. Stellar pulsations are emphasized as the most complex type of variability, which also has the greatest potential to reveal the conditions of white dwarf interiors.</description>

      <title>First Imaging of Magnetic Waveguides and Resonant Cavities in Sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we have determined the spatial distribution of magnetic waveguides and resonant cavities at different heights in the sunspot atmosphere. We applied a decomposition of time cubes of EUV/UV sunspot images obtained in the SDO/AIA temperature channels into narrowband components in the form of wave sources. The methods of pixelized wavelet filtering and oscillation mode decomposition were used. For all studied sunspots the presence of selected bands in the spectra was shown. Each band corresponds to oscillations forming spatial waveguides in the volume of the sunspot atmosphere. The formation of waveguide bundles in the height from photospheric to coronal levels is shown. The regions of the waveguides with maximum oscillation power, where resonant cavities are formed, are identified. Their detection is an experimental proof of the theory of resonant layers, previously proposed to explain the presence of significant harmonics in the oscillation spectrum. The different shapes of the cavities reflect the structure of the magnetic tubes along which the waves propagate. The distribution of sources in the height layers indicates the influence of the wave cutoff frequency caused by the inclinations of the magnetic field lines. We discuss the possibility of upward wave transport due to periodic amplification of the oscillation power in the detected cavities.</description>

      <title>Using detailed single star and binary evolution models to probe the large observed luminosity spread of red supergiants in young open star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs) represent a late evolutionary stage of massive stars. Recent observations reveal that the observed luminosity range of RSGs in young open clusters is wider than expected from single star evolution models. Binary evolution effects have been suggested as a possible explanation. Here, we analyse 3670 detailed binary-evolution models, as well as corresponding single-star models, to probe the contribution of binary mass transfer and binary mergers on the luminosity distribution of RSGs in star clusters with ages up to 100 Myr. We confirm that the expected luminosity range of RSGs in a coeval population can span a factor of ten, as a consequence of mergers between two main-sequence stars, which reproduces the observed red supergiant luminosity ranges in rich clusters well. While the luminosity increase as consequence of mass transfer is more limited, it may help to increase the number of overluminous RSGs. However, our results also demonstrate that binary effects alone are insufficient to account for the number of RSGs found with luminosities of up to three times those predicted by current single-star models. We discuss observational accuracy, rotational mixing, age spread, and intrinsic RSG variability as possible explanations. Further observations of RSGs in young open clusters, in particular studies of their intrinsic brightness variability, appear crucial for disentangling these effects.</description>

      <title>Propagation of waves in weakly ionized two-fluid plasmas. I. Small-amplitude Alfv\'enic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large abundance of electrically neutral particles has a remarkable impact on the dynamics of many astrophysical plasmas. Here, we use a two-fluid model that includes charge-neutral elastic collisions and Hall's current to study the propagation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in weakly ionized plasmas. we derive the dispersion relation for small-amplitude incompressible transverse waves propagating along the background magnetic field. Then, we focus on the polarization relations fulfilled by the eigenmodes and their corresponding ratios of magnetic to kinetic energies, and we study their dependence on the relations between the oscillation, collision and cyclotron frequencies. For low wave frequencies, the two components of the plasma are strongly coupled, the damping due to the charge-neutral interaction is weak and the effect of Hall's term is negligible. However, as the wave frequency increases, phase shifts between the velocity of charges, the velocity of neutrals, and the magnetic field appear, leading to enhanced damping. The effect of collisions on the propagation of waves strongly depends on their polarization state, with the left-handed circularly polarized ion-cyclotron modes being more efficiently damped than the linearly polarized Alfv\'en waves and the right-handed circularly polarized whistler modes. Moreover, the equipartition relation between the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy of Alfv\'en waves does not hold in general when the collisional interaction and Hall's current are taken into account, with the magnetic energy usually dominating over the kinetic energy. This theoretical result extends previous findings from observational and numerical works about turbulence in astrophysical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hunting pre-stellar cores with APEX: Corona Australis 151, the densest pre-stellar core or the youngest protostar?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Pre-stellar cores are the birthplaces of Sun-like stars and represent the initial conditions for the assembly of protoplanetary systems. Due to their short lifespans, they are rare. In recent efforts to increase the number of such sources identified in the Solar neighbourhood, we have selected a sample of 40 starless cores from the publicly available core catalogs of the Herschel Gould Belt survey. In this work, we focus on one of the sources that stands out for its high central density: Corona Australis 151. Aims. We use molecular lines that trace dense gas (n&gt;=10^6 cm-3) to confirm the exceptionally high density of this object, to study its physical structure, and to understand its evolutionary stage. Methods. We detected the N2H+ 3-2 and 5-4 transitions, and the N2D+ 3-2, 4-3, and 6-5 lines with the APEX telescope. We use the Herschel continuum data to infer a spherically symmetric model of the core's density and temperature. This is used as input to perform non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to fit the observed five lines. Results. Our analysis confirms that this core is characterised by very high densities (a few x 10^7 cm-3 at the centre) and cold temperatures. We infer a high deuteration level of N2D+/N2H+=0.50, indicative of an advanced evolutionary stage. In the large bandwidth covered by the APEX data, we detect several other deuterated species, including CHD2OH, D2CO, and ND3. We also detect multiple sulphurated species that present broader lines with signs of high-velocity wings. Conclusions. The observation of high-velocity wings and the fact that the linewidths of N2H+ and N2D+ become larger with increasing frequency can be interpreted either as an indication of supersonic infall motions developing in the central parts of a very evolved pre-stellar core or as the signature of outflows from a very low luminosity object (VeLLO). *SHORTENED*</description>

      <title>The T16 Project: Image Subtraction Light Curves from TESS Cycle 1 Full-Frame Images for Stars with T &lt; 16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 83,717,159 light curves for 56,401,549 stars with T &lt; 16 mag observed in the Full-Frame Images (FFIs) of Cycle 1 of the NASA TESS mission. These light curves were extracted from subtracted images produced by the Cluster Difference Imaging Survey (CDIPS; Bouma et al. 2019). We make public the raw image subtraction light curves, together with light curves detrended against instrumental systematics. We compare the light curves to other publicly available light curves from the TESS FFIs, finding that for a substantial fraction of stars with T &lt; 16, the T16 project provides the highest precision FFI light curves available. We demonstrate that the detrended T16 light curves are generally as good as, or better than, the light curves from other projects for the known TOIs. We also show that the un-detrended light curves can be used to study high amplitude variable stars. The light curves are being made available through the NASA Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). Light curve production is underway for additional TESS Cycles.</description>

      <title>PINN ME: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Accurate Milne-Eddington Inversions of Solar Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetric inversions of solar observations are fundamental for the estimation of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere. However, instrumental noise, computational requirements, and varying levels of physical realism make it challenging to derive reliable solar magnetic field estimates. In this study, we present a novel approach for spectropolarimetric inversions based on Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to infer the photospheric magnetic field under the Milne-Eddington approximation (PINN ME). Our model acts as a representation of the parameter space, mapping input coordinates (t, x, y) to the respective spectropolarimetric parameters, which are used to synthesize the corresponding stokes profiles. By iteratively sampling coordinate points, synthesizing profiles, and minimizing the deviation from the observed stokes profiles, our method can find the set of Milne-Eddington parameters that best fit the observations. In addition, we directly include the point-spread-function to account for instrumental effects. We use a predefined parameter space as well as synthetic profiles from a radiative MHD simulation to evaluate the performance of our method and to estimate the impact of instrumental noise. Our results demonstrate that PINN ME achieves an intrinsic spatio-temporal coupling, which can largely mitigate observational noise and provides a memory-efficient inversion even for extended fields-of-view. Finally, we apply our method to observations and show that our method provides a high spatial coherence and can resolve small-scale features both in strong- and weak-field regions.</description>

      <title>Polytropic Behavior in Corotating Interaction Regions: Evidence of Alfv\'enic Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) are recurring structures in the solar wind, characterized by interactions between fast and slow solar wind streams that compress and heat plasma. This study investigates the polytropic behavior of distinct regions in and around CIRs: uncompressed slow solar wind, compressed slow solar wind, compressed fast solar wind, and uncompressed fast solar wind. Using Wind spacecraft data and an established methodology for calculating the polytropic index ({\gamma}), we analyze 117 CIR events. Results indicate varying {\gamma} values across regions, with heating observed in compressed regions driven by Alfv\'en wave dissipation originating from fast streams. In the uncompressed fast solar wind, {\gamma} exceeds adiabatic values the most and correlates well with strong Alfv\'enic wave activity.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology with TESS: Emergence of Dipole Mode Suppression From Subgiants?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipole mode suppression is an observed behavior of solar-like oscillations in evolved stars. This study aims to search for depressed dipole modes in giant stars using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and investigate when the suppression starts to emerge. We study a sample of 8,651 TESS-evolved stars and find 179 stars with significant dipole mode depression by comparing the oscillation amplitudes of radial and dipole modes. Notably, 11 of them are located near the base of the red-giant branch, indicating that mode suppression appears earlier than the point inferred in previous studies with the Kepler data. These findings provide new evidence for the dipole mode suppression in giant stars, particularly in subgiants.</description>

      <title>What defines stationarity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13168v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the concept of entropy defect in thermodynamics, we construct the entropy formulation of space plasmas, and then use it to develop a measure of their stationarity. In particular, we show that statistics of this entropy results in two findings that improve our understanding of stationary and nonstationary systems: (i) variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy do not exceed twice the value of the thermodynamic kappa, the parameter that provides a measure of the entropy defect in both stationary and nonstationary states, while becomes the shape parameter that labels the kappa distributions in stationary states; and (ii) the ratio of the deviation of the BG entropy with kappa scales with the kappa deviation via a power-law, while the respective exponent provides a stationarity deviation index (SDI), which measures the natural tendency of the system to depart from stationarity. We confirm the validity of these findings in three different heliospheric plasma datasets observed from three missions: (1) A solar energetic particle event, recorded by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument onboard Parker Solar Probe; (2) Near Earth solar wind protons recorded by the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard WIND; and (3) Plasma protons in the inner heliosphere, source of energetic neutral atoms recorded by IBEX. The full strength and capability of the entropic deviation ratio and SDI can now be used by the space physics community for analyzing and characterizing the stationarity of space plasmas, as well as other researchers for analyzing any other correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Inconsistent metallicity spreads in first generation stars of globular clusters from high resolution spectroscopy and HST photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open issue about multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) is the possible existence of metallicity spreads in first generation (FG) stars. Recent estimates based on HST pseudo-colours map (PCM) derived unlikely large spreads in [Fe/H] from spreads in the colour col=m_{F275W}-m_{F814W}. The inferred metallicity spreads for many GCs are comparable or even larger than those observed in dwarf galaxies. This result is clearly unexpected and at odds with the birth time of stars in dwarf galaxies, spanning several billion years, as opposed to very short formation times of the stellar component in GCs (a few million years). The contradiction is corroborated by the comparison of the widths of red giant branches in both classes of objects. Moreover, the so called spreads in FG stars estimated from the PCMs are always larger than the intrinsic metallicity spreads derived from spectroscopy. We used 30 pairs of FG stars with similar parameters in 12 GCs to highlight that a constant displacement in Delta col corresponds to variable differences in [Fe/H] up to 0.2 dex, depending on the GC. Providing for the first time quantitative measurements of the extension in Delta col of the sequences of FG and SG stars, we found no relation between metallicity spreads previously derived and extension of FG stars. We found that the length of the FG region correlates with the average global metallicity of GCs, and not with the observed metallicity spreads. The extension of FG stars also correlates with the extension of SG stars, and the global mass of the GCs. Our findings seriously challenge the scenario claiming more inhomogeneous mixing among FG stars, invalidating previous speculations in the literature.</description>

      <title>Introduction to magnetic star-planet interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between planets and their host stars is governed by the forces of gravity, radiation, and magnetic fields. For planets orbiting their stars at distances of approximately 10 stellar radii or less, these effects are significantly intensified. Such interactions can be investigated through a combination of photometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric studies spanning wavelengths from X-rays to radio frequencies. When a hot planet resides within the star's sub-Alfv\'enic radius, magnetic star-planet interactions (SPI) become possible, often observable as stellar activity enhancements influenced by the planet's orbital motion rather than stellar rotation alone. Such interactions offer a unique perspective on the atmospheric erosion and magnetospheric characteristics of close-in exoplanets.The behavior and impacts of these magnetic interactions are highly sensitive to the magnetic fields of both the planet and its host star. This interplay can influence the magnetic activity of both bodies and has implications for the planet's irradiation levels, orbital migration, and the star's rotational dynamics. By employing phase-resolved observational methods on an expanding sample of hot Jupiter (HJ) systems, researchers can now extend these studies to other compact star-planet systems, including smaller planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs. Efforts to comprehend magnetic SPI have led to extensive advancements in theoretical research and computational modeling. These efforts include investigations into the space weather environments of close-in giant exoplanets. Utilizing hydrodynamical (HD) and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, researchers aim to provide both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of SPI. In this chapter, we first review notable SPI detections before summarizing the current understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms driving SPI.</description>

      <title>A Python Toolkit for Plotting Double Star Observations with 1:1 Aspect Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13340v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate visualization of double star astrometric data is essential for effective analysis and interpretation. This article presents a Python toolkit designed for astronomers who need to plot measurements from diverse sources -- historical, Gaia DR3, and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) network -- while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio to avoid visually distorting the data. The toolkit is composed of three scripts: one that handles polar coordinates (P.A., separation), one for Cartesian (X, Y) coordinates, and another with the option to include predicted theoretical points. This paper describes the purpose, functionality, and usage of these scripts, including example figures, installation guides, and licensing information.
  This toolkit has been used by the author and collaborators in published and submitted research on double star systems, demonstrating its versatility for both professional and student-driven investigations.</description>

      <title>HCN and C2H2 in the atmosphere of a T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T-type brown dwarfs present an opportunity to explore atmospheres teeming with molecules such as H2O, CH4 and NH3, which exhibit a wealth of absorption features in the mid-infrared. With JWST, we can finally explore this chemistry in detail, including for the coldest brown dwarfs that were not yet discovered in the Spitzer era. This allows precise derivations of the molecular abundances, which in turn informs our understanding of vertical transport in these atmospheres and can provide clues about the formation of cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This study presents the first JWST/MRS mid-IR spectrum (R ~ 1500-3000) of a T-dwarf: the T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary WISE J045853.90+643451.9. We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T profile and free molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis), treating the binary as unresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free atmosphere and identify H2O, CH4 and NH3 features. Moreover, we make the first detections of HCN and C2H2 (at 13.4$\sigma$ and 9.5$\sigma$ respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere. The detection of HCN suggests intense vertical mixing ($K_{zz}\sim10^{11}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), challenging previous literature derivations of $K_{zz}$ values for T-type brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is the C2H2 detection, which cannot be explained with existing atmospheric models for isolated objects. This result challenges model assumptions about vertical mixing, and/or our understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint towards a more complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving aurorae, or lightning driving ionization. These findings open a new frontier in studying carbon chemistry within brown dwarf atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Precise and Accurate Mass and Radius Measurements of Fifteen Galactic Red Giants in Detached Eclipsing Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise and accurate mass and radius measurements of evolved stars are crucial to calibrating stellar models. Stars in detached eclipsing binaries (EBs) are excellent potential calibrators because their stellar parameters can be measured with fractional uncertainties of a few percent, independent of stellar models. The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) has identified tens of thousands of EBs, &gt;35,000 of which were included in the ASAS-SN eclipsing binaries catalog. Here, we select eight EBs from this sample that contain giants based on their Gaia colors and absolute magnitudes. We use LBT/PEPSI, APF, and CHIRON to obtain multi-epoch spectra of these binaries and measure their radial velocities using two-dimensional cross-correlation methods. We simultaneously fit the ASAS-SN light curves and the radial velocities with PHOEBE to derive accurate and precise masses and radii with fractional uncertainties of $\lesssim 3\%$. For four systems, we also include Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves in our PHOEBE models, which significantly improves the radius determinations. In seven of our systems, both components have evolved off of the main sequence, and one system has a giant star component with a main sequence, Sun-like companion. Finally, we compare our mass and radius measurements to single-star evolutionary tracks and distinguish between systems that are first ascent red giant branch stars and those that are likely core helium-burning stars.</description>

      <title>Solar Cycles: Can They Be Predicted?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solar magnetic field, thought to be generated by the motion of plasma within the Sun, alternates on the order of 11-year cycles and is incompletely understood. Industries rely on accurate forecasts of solar activity, but can solar cycles be predicted? Of more than 100 predictions for cycle 25, most underestimated the amplitude (peak sunspot number). Fewer predictions were made for the timing of solar maximum, but timing predictions seem to be performing better than amplitude predictions. Reasons for inaccurate prediction are suggested, and perspectives are given on how future studies might improve upon the extant literature.</description>

      <title>Four Total Eclipsing Contact Binary Systems: The First Photometric Light Curve Solutions Employing TESS and Gaia Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We presented the first photometric light curve solutions of four W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binary systems. This investigation utilized photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). We used the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for these light curve solutions. Only TIC 249064185 among the target systems needed a cold starspot to be included in the analysis. Based on the estimated mass ratios for these total eclipse systems, three of them are categorized as low mass ratio contact binary stars. The absolute parameters of the systems were estimated using the Gaia DR3 parallax method and the orbital period and semi-major axis ($P-a$) empirical relationship. We defined that TIC 318015356 and TIC 55522736 systems are A-subtypes, while TIC 249064185 and TIC 397984843 are W-subtypes, depending on each component's effective temperature and mass. We estimated the initial masses of the stars, the mass lost by the binary system, and the systems' ages. We displayed star positions in the mass-radius, mass-luminosity, and total mass-orbital angular momentum diagrams. In addition, our findings indicate a good agreement with the mass-temperature empirical parameter relationship for the primary stars.</description>

      <title>Orbital Dynamics of the Solar Basin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the solar basin -- the accumulated population of weakly-interacting particles on bound orbits in the Solar System. We focus on particles starting off on Sun-crossing orbits, corresponding to initial conditions of production inside the Sun, and investigate their evolution over the age of the Solar System. A combination of analytic methods, secular perturbation theory, and direct numerical integration of orbits sheds light on the long- and short-term evolution of a population of test particles orbiting the Sun and perturbed by the planets. Our main results are that the effective lifetime of a solar basin at Earth's location is $\tau_{\rm eff} = 1.20\pm 0.09 \,\mathrm{Gyr}$, and that there is annual (semi-annual) modulation of the basin density with known phase and amplitude at the fractional level of 6.5% (2.2%). These results have important implications for direct detection searches of solar basin particles, and the strong temporal modulation signature yields a robust discovery channel. Our simulations can also be interpreted in the context of gravitational capture of dark matter in the Solar System, with consequences for any dark-matter phenomenon that may occur below the local escape velocity.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Beta Pictoris planetary system and possibility of an additional planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\beta$ Pictoris system is characterized by a dusty debris disk, in addition to the presence of two already known planets. This makes it a particularly interesting case for studying the formation and evolution of planetary systems at a stage where giant planets have already formed, most of the protoplanetary gas has dissipated, and terrestrial planets could emerge. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of additional planets orbiting beyond the outermost known one, $\beta$ Pic b. More specifically, we aim to assess whether additional planets in the system could explain the discrepancy between the predicted cutoff of the disk inner cavity at $\sim$28 au with only two planets, and the observed one at $\sim$50 au. We performed an exhaustive dynamical modeling of the debris disk and the carving of its inner edge, by introducing one or two additional planets beyond $\beta$ Pic b, coplanar with the disk. Guided by theoretical predictions for the parameter space - mass, semi-major axis, eccentricity - allowed for additional planets, we further carried out a set of N-body simulations, using the symplectic integrator RMVS3. Our simulations indicate that an additional planet with a low eccentricity of 0.05, a mass between 0.15 and 1 $M_{Jup}$, and a semi-major axis between 30 and 36 au, would be consistent with the observations of an inner debris disk edge at 50 au. We have also explored the hypotheses of a higher eccentricity and the presence of two additional lower mass planets instead of one, which could also account for these observations. While we find that one or even two additional planets could explain the observed location of the disk inner edge, these hypothetical planets remain in most cases below the current observational limits of high contrast imaging. Future observational campaigns with improved sensitivity will help lowering these limits and perhaps detect that planet.</description>

      <title>Magnetic disk winds in protoplanetary disks: Description of the model and impact on global disk evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Canonically, a protoplanetary disk is thought to undergo (gravito-)viscous evolution, wherein the angular momentum of the accreting material is transported outwards. However, several lines of reasoning suggest that the turbulent viscosity in a typical protoplanetary disk is insufficient to drive the observed accretion rates. An emerging paradigm suggests that radially extended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We propose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of protoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box simulations. Here we develop this model and constrain its parameters with the help of theoretical expectations and comparison with observations. The magnetic wind is characterized with the associated loss of angular momentum and mass, which depend on the local disk conditions and stellar properties. We incorporate the disk winds self-consistently in the code FEOSAD and study formation and long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks. We include disk self-gravity and an adaptive turbulent alpha, while the co-evolution of dust is also considered. Synthetic observations are obtained via radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo. The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy general expectations from both theory and observations. The disk wind parameters can be guided by observational constraints and the synthetic observations resulting from such a model compare favorably with the selected ALMA survey data of Class II disks. The proposed magnetic disk wind model is a significant step forward in the direction of representing a more complete disk evolution, wherein the disk experiences concurrent torques from viscous, gravitational, and magnetic wind processes.</description>
