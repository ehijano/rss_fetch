      <title>The Largest and Smallest Eigenvalues of Matrices and Some Hamiltonian Properties of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. We define matrices $M(G; \alpha, \beta)$as $\alpha D + \beta A$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$ are real numbers such that $(\alpha, \beta) \neq (0, 0)$ and $D$ and $A$ are the diagonal matrix and adjacency matrix of $G$, respectively. Using the largest and smallest eigenvalues of $M(G; \alpha, \beta)$ with $\alpha \geq \beta &gt; 0$, we present sufficient conditions for the Hamiltonian and traceable graphs.</description>

      <title>Zero Forcing of Generalized Hierarchical Products of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero forcing is a graph propagation process for which vertices fill-in (or propagate information to) neighbor vertices if all neighbors except for one, are filled. The zero-forcing number is the smallest number of vertices that must be filled to begin the process so that the entire graph or network becomes filled. In this paper, bounds are provided on the zero forcing number of generalized hierarchical products.</description>

      <title>Limits of sparse hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize ultraproducts and local-global limits of graphs to hypergraphs and other structures. We show that the local statistics of an ultraproduct of a sequence of hypergraphs are the ultralimits of the local statistics of the hypergraphs. Using some standard results from model theory, we conclude that the space of (equivalence classes of) pmp hypergraphs with the topology of local-global convergence is compact, and that any countable set of local statistics for a pmp hypergraph can be realized as the statistics of a set of labellings (rather than just approximated) in a local-global equivalent hypergraph.
  We give two applications. First, we characterize those structures where any solution to the corresponding CSP can be turned into a measurable solution. These turn out to be the width-1 structures. We can also use the limit machinery to extract from this theorem a purely finitary characterizations of width-1 structures involving asymptotic solutions.
  Second, we prove two measurable versions of the Frankl--R\"odl matching theorem using measurable nibble and differential equation arguments. The measurable proofs are much softer than the purely finitary results. And, we can recover the finitary theorems using the limit machinery.</description>

      <title>Counting largest mutual-visibility and general position sets of glued $t$-ary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All four invariants of the mutual-visibility problem and, all four invariants of the general position problem are determined for glued binary trees. The number of the corresponding extremal sets is obtained in each of the eight situations. The results are further extended to glued $t$-ary trees, and some of them also to generalized glued binary trees.</description>

      <title>Faber-Krahn type inequality for supertrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Faber-Krahn inequality states that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue among all bounded domains is no less than a Euclidean ball with the same volume in $\mathbb{R}^n$ \cite{Chavel FB}. B{\i}y{\i}ko\u{g}lu and Leydold (J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B., 2007) demonstrated that the Faber-Krahn inequality also holds for the class of trees with boundary with the same degree sequence and characterized the unique extremal tree. B{\i}y{\i}ko\u{g}lu and Leydold (2007) also posed a question as follows: Give a characterization of all graphs in a given class $\mathcal{C}$ with the Faber-Krahn property. In this paper, we address this question specifically for $k$-uniform supertrees with boundary. We introduce a spiral-like ordering (SLO-ordering) of vertices for supertrees, an extension of the SLO-ordering for trees initially proposed by Pruss [ Duke Math. J., 1998], and prove that the SLO-supertree has the Faber-Krahn property among all supertrees with a given degree sequence. Furthermore, among degree sequences that have a minimum degree $d$ for interior vertices, the SLO-supertree with degree sequence $(d,\ldots,d, d', 1, \dots, 1)$ possesses the Faber-Krahn property.</description>

      <title>On local antimagic chromatic number of the join of two special families of graphs -- II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that null graphs and 1-regular graphs are the only regular graphs without local antimagic chromatic number. In this paper, we proved that the join of 1-regular graph and a null graph has local antimagic chromatic number is 3. Consequently, we also obtained many families of (possibly disconnected or regular) bipartite and tripartite graph with local antimagic chromatic number 3.</description>

      <title>$k$-Hyperopic Cops and Robber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of hyperopic cops and robber, analogous to the $k$-visibility cops and robber, is introduced in this paper. For a positive integer $k$ the $k$-hyperopic game of cops and robber is defined similarly as the usual cops and robber game, but with the robber being omniscient and invisible to the cops that are at distance at most $k$ away from the robber. The cops win the game if, after a finite number of rounds, a cop occupies the same vertex as robber. Otherwise, robber wins. The minimum number of cops needed to win the game on a graph $G$ is the $k$-hyperopic cop number $c_{H,k}(G)$ of $G$.
  In addition to basic properties of the new invariant, cop-win graphs are characterized and a general upper bound in terms of the matching number of the graph is given. The invariant is also studied on trees where the upper bounds mostly depend on the relation between $k$ and the diameter of the tree. It is also proven that the 2-hyperopic cop number of outerplanar graphs is at most 2 and an upper bound in terms of the number of vertices of the graph is presented for $k \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>The minimum number of maximal independent sets in graphs with given order and independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $MIS(G)$ be the set of all maximal independent sets in a graph $G$, and let $mis(G)=|MIS(G)|$. In this paper, we show that for any tree $T$ with $n$ vertices and independence number $\alpha$,
  \[mis(T)\geq f(n-\alpha),\]
  and for any unicyclic graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and independence number $\alpha$,
  \begin{align*}
  mis(G)\geq
  \begin{cases}
  2, &amp; \text{if} \ n=4\ \text{and}\ \alpha=2,
  3, &amp; \text{if} \; \alpha=n-2 \; \text{and} \; n\neq4,
  2f(n-\alpha), &amp; \text{if} \; n\geq 5\; \text{and}\; \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil \leq \alpha &lt; n-2,
  f(n-\alpha+2)-f(n-\alpha-3), &amp;\text{if} \; n\geq 5, \;\text{and}\ n \; \text{is odd}, \; \text{and} \; \alpha = \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor,
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  where $f(n)$ represent the $n$th Fibonacci number. Moreover, we also show that the above inequalities are sharp.</description>

      <title>Recursive properties of Cohen--Macaulay flag simplicial complexes and Lefschetz decompositions from $f$-vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most applications of the hard Lefschetz theorem related to combinatorial properties of simplicial complexes involve their $h$-vectors. In the context of positivity properties involving $h$-vectors of flag spheres, $f$-vectors with a Lefschetz-type ``Boolean'' decomposition have been studied. In this note, we explore families of flag simplicial complexes where we can see this Boolean decomposition explicitly in terms of transformations connecting different simplicial complexes in this family. Note that we will take complexes in a given dimension to be PL homeomorphic to each other. In particular, the existence of a Boolean decomposition patched from local parts can be phrased in terms of a certain map formally satisfying an analogue of the hard Lefschetz theorem. The map is given by the composition of a double suspension with a ``net single edge subdivision''. Here, the former contributes to the Boolean part and the latter contributes to the disjoint non-Boolean part. The fact that the simplicial complex with the given $f$-vector can be taken to be balanced suggests algebraic versions of maps connected to these decompositions.</description>

      <title>A remark on s-torsion pairs and on the lattice of Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are three classical lattices on the Catalan numbers: the Tamari lattice, the lattice of noncrossing partitions and the lattice of Dyck paths. The first is known to be isomorphic to the lattice of torsion classes of the path algebra of an equioriented quiver of type $A$ and the second is known to be isomorphic to its lattice of wide subcategories. Inspired by the notion of s-torsion classes of Adachi, Enomoto and Tsukamoto, in this short note we interpret the lattice of Dyck paths as a lattice of subcategories.</description>

      <title>On the Heine Binomial Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Heine binomial operators H$_{n}(bD_{q})$ based on $q$-differential operator $D_{q}$. The motivation for introducing the operators H$_{n}(bD_{q})$ is that their limit turns out to be the $q$-exponential operator T$(bD_{q})$ given by Chen. The Hahn polynomials $\Phi_{m}^{(q^n)}(b,x|q)$ can easily be represented by using the operators H$_{n}(bD_{q})$. Here, we derive $q$-exponential and ordinary generating function, Mehler's formula, Rogers formula, and other identities for the polynomials $\Phi_{m}^{(q^n)}(b,x|q)$.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and complexity for monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set of a graph is a subset $M$ of its vertices such that for every edge $e$ in the graph, deleting $e$ increases the distance between at least one pair of vertices in $M$. We study the following computational problem \textsc{MEG-set}: given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether $G$ has a monitoring edge geodetic set of size at most $k$. We prove that the problem is NP-hard even for 2-apex 3-degenerate graphs, improving a result by Haslegrave (Discrete Applied Mathematics 2023). Additionally, we prove that the problem cannot be solved in subexponential-time, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, even for 3-degenerate graphs. Further, we prove that the optimization version of the problem is APX-hard, even for 4-degenerate graphs. Complementing these hardness results, we prove that the problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm for interval graphs, a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for general graphs with clique-width plus diameter as the parameter, and a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for chordal graphs with treewidth as the parameter. We also provide an approximation algorithm with factor $\ln m\cdot OPT$ and $\sqrt{n\ln m}$ for the optimization version of the problem, where $m$ is the number of edges, $n$ the number of vertices, and $OPT$ is the size of a minimum monitoring edge-geodetic set of the input graph.</description>

Abstract: Euler's classic partition identity states that the number of partitions of $n$ into odd parts equals the number of partitions of $n$ into distinct parts. We develop a new generalization of this identity, which yields a previous generalization of Franklin as a special case, and prove an accompanying Beck-type companion identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new infinite family of $d\times 2d$ equiangular tight frames. Many matrices in this family consist of two $d\times d$ circulant blocks. We conjecture that such equiangular tight frames exist for every $d$. We show that our conjecture holds for $d\leq 165$ by a computer-assisted application of a Newton-Kantorovich theorem. In addition, we supply numerical constructions that corroborate our conjecture for $d\leq 1500$.</description>

      <title>Congruences involving Delannoy numbers and Schr\"oder numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central Delannoy numbers $D_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}\binom{n+k}{k}$ and the little Schr\"oder number $s_n=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{n}\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{k-1}2^{n-k}$ are important quantities. In this paper, we confirm \[\frac{2}{3n(n+1)}\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{n-k}k^2D_kD_{k-1}\ \text{and}\ \ \frac 1n\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{n-k}(4k^2+2k-1)D_{k-1}s_k\]are positive odd integers for all $n=1,2,3,\cdots$. We also show that for any prime number $p&gt;3$, \[\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} (-1)^kk^2D_kD_{k-1}\ \equiv\ -\frac56p \pmod{p^2}\] and \[\sum_{k=1}^p (-1)^k(4k^2+2k-1)D_{k-1}s_k\ \equiv\ -4p \pmod{p^2}\text{.}\] Moreover, define \begin{equation*} s_n(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{n}\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{k-1}x^{k-1}(x+1)^{n-k}, \end{equation*} for any $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ is even we have \begin{equation*} \frac{4}{n(n+1)(n+2)(1+2x)^3}\sum_{k=1}^{n}k(k+1)(k+2)s_k(x)s_{k+1}(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]. \end{equation*}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a criterion for a skeleton of a manifold triangulation being embeddable into Euclidean space in terms of the complement of a submanifold. As an application, we obtain embeddability of a $(q-1)$-skeleton of a triangulation of an $S^p$-bundle over $S^q$ into $\mathbb{R}^{p+q}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized B\"acklund-Darboux transformations for Coxeter-Toda systems on simple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the cluster structure on the conjugation quotient Coxeter double Bruhat cells of a simple Lie group from that on the double Bruhat cells of the corresponding adjoint Lie group given by Fock and Goncharov using the notion of amalgamation given by Fock and Goncharov, and Williams, thereby generalizing the construction developed by Gekhtman \emph{et al}. We will then use this cluster structure on the conjugation quotient Coxeter double Bruhat cells to construct generalized B\"{a}cklund-Darboux transformations between two Coxeter-Toda systems on simple Lie groups in terms of cluster mutations, thereby generalizing the construction developed by Gekhtman \emph{et al}. We show that these generalized B\"{a}cklund-Darboux transformations preserve Hamiltonian flows generated by the restriction of the trace function of any representation of the simple Lie group, from which we deduce that the family of Coxeter-Toda systems on a simple Lie group forms a single cluster integrable system. Finally, we also develop network formulations of the Coxeter-Toda Hamiltonians for the classical Lie groups, and use these network formulations to obtain combinatorial formulas for these Coxeter-Toda Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Free Products and the Isomorphism between Standard and Dual Artin Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Coxeter system with a fixed Coxeter element, there is a surjective group morphism $\Psi$ from the standard to the dual Artin groups. We give conditions that are sufficient, necessary or equivalent to $\Psi$ being an isomorphism. In particular, we prove that if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of any element in the noncrossing partition poset is transitive, and if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of the Coxeter element has the same stabilizer as essentially the same action viewed in the standard Artin group, then $\Psi$ is an isomorphism. Both of those conditions are already known in some cases, notably in spherical and affine types. We then prove that taking the free (or direct) product of groups that satisfy those two conditions yields another group that, with a suitable Coxeter element, also satisfies them.</description>

      <title>Random $2$-SAT: The set of atoms of the limiting empirical marginal distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the set of atoms of the limiting empirical marginal distribution in the random $2$-SAT model is $\mathbb Q \cap (0,1)$, for all clause-to-variable densities up to the satisfiability threshold. While for densities up to $1/2$, the measure is purely discrete, we additionally establish the existence of a nontrivial continuous part for any density in $(1/2, 1)$. Our proof is based on the construction of a random variable with the correct distribution as the the root marginal of a multi-type Galton-Watson tree, along with a subsequent analysis of the resulting almost sure recursion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the relationship between discrete groups of symmetries of Euclidean three-space, constructions in algebraic geometry around Kleinian singularities including versions of Hilbert and Quot schemes, and their relationship to finite-dimensional and affine Lie algebras via the McKay correspondence. We focus on combinatorial aspects, such as the enumeration of certain types of partition-like objects, reviewing in particular a recently developed root-of-unity-substitution calculus. While the most complete results are in type A, we also develop aspects of the theory in type D, and end with some questions about the exceptional type E cases.</description>

      <title>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta &gt; 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_\mathrm{op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau &gt; 0$. Our contributions are twofold. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau &lt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau &gt; \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions becomes exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau&gt;\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish for the first time that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the typical semicircle law. Our proofs rely on deriving concentration inequalities and large deviation properties for the law of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints, extending results in the literature and offering insights of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the lumpability of tree-valued Markov chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees constitute an interesting class of objects for stochastic processes due to the non-standard nature of the space they inhabit. In particular, many statistical applications require the construction of Markov processes on the space of trees, whose cardinality grows superexponentially with the number of leaves considered. We investigate whether certain lower-dimensional projections of tree space preserve the Markov property in tree-valued Markov processes. We study exact lumpability of tree shapes and $\varepsilon$-lumpability of clades, exploiting the combinatorial structure of the SPR graph to obtain bounds on the lumping error under the random walk and Metropolis-Hastings processes. Finally, we show how to use these results in empirical investigation, leveraging exact and $\varepsilon$-lumpability to improve Monte Carlo estimation of tree-related quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.14604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We leverage a correspondence between group actions and edge-labelled graphs in two ways. First, we give a unified presentation of several folklore results connecting weak containment, local-global convergence, and continuous model theory. Second, we investigate the difference between $\operatorname{Aut}(\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma))$-fiid combinatorics and $\Gamma$-fiid combinatorics for various marked groups $\Gamma$. It's straightforward to see that these differences vanish when $\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma)$ admits an $\operatorname{Aut}(\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma))$-fiid Cayley diagram. We extend this to show that the approximate combinatorics are the same when $\operatorname{Cay}(\Gamma)$ admits an approximate fiid Cayley diagram, and we give several examples and nonexamples of groups whose Cayley graphs admit (approximate) fiid Cayley diagrams.
  In particular, we show that trees admit approximate Cayley diagrams for any group whose Cayley graph is a tree; Cayley graphs of torsion free nilpotent groups do not admit fiid Cayley diagrams; and there are groups with isomorphic Cayley graphs so that only one them admits even an approximate Cayley diagram (in fact our construction answers a question of Weilacher).</description>

Abstract: A family of subsets of $[n]$ is intersecting if every pair of its sets intersects. Determining the structure of large intersecting families is a central problem in extremal combinatorics. Frankl-Kupavskii and Balogh-Das-Liu-Sharifzadeh-Tran independently showed that for $n\geq 2k + c\sqrt{k\ln k}$, almost all $k$-uniform intersecting families are stars. Improving their result, we show that the same conclusion holds for $n\geq 2k+ 100\ln k$. Our proof uses, among others, Sapozhenko's graph container lemma and the Das-Tran removal lemma.</description>

Abstract: We develop a method to study sufficient conditions for perfect mixed tilings. Our framework allows the embedding of bounded degree graphs $H$ with components of sublinear order. As a corollary, we recover and extend the work of K\"uhn and Osthus regarding sufficient minimum degree conditions for perfect $F$-tilings (for an arbitrary fixed graph $F$) by replacing the $F$-tiling with the aforementioned graphs $H$. Moreover, we obtain analogous results for degree sequences and in the setting of uniformly dense graphs. Finally, we asymptotically resolve a conjecture of Koml\'os in a strong sense.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the saturation number and a strengthening for triangle-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The saturation number $\operatorname{sat}(n, H)$ of a graph $H$ and positive integer $n$ is the minimum size of an $n$-vertex graph which does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to $H$ but to which the addition of any edge creates such a subgraph. Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Moon first studied saturation numbers of complete graphs, and Cameron and Puleo introduced a general lower bound on $\operatorname{sat}(n,H)$. In this paper, we present another lower bound on $\operatorname{sat}(n, H)$ with a strengthening when $H$ is triangle-free. Demonstrating its effectiveness, we determine the saturation numbers of diameter-$3$ trees up to an additive constant; these are double stars $S_{s,t}$ on $s + t$ vertices whose centers have degrees $s$ and $t$. Faudree, Faudree, Gould, and Jacobson determined that $\operatorname{sat}(n, S_{t,t}) = (t-1)n/2 + O(1)$. We show that $\operatorname{sat}(n,S_{s,t}) = (st+s)n/(2t+4) + O(1)$ when $s &lt; t$. We also determine lower and upper bounds on the saturation numbers of certain diameter-$4$ caterpillars.</description>

Abstract: Let $T$ be a tree on $t$ vertices. We prove that for every positive integer $k$ and every graph $G$, either $G$ contains $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint subgraphs each having a $T$ minor, or there exists a set $X$ of at most $t(k-1)$ vertices of $G$ such that $G-X$ has no $T$ minor. The bound on the size of $X$ is best possible and improves on an earlier $f(t)k$ bound proved by Fiorini, Joret, and Wood (2013) with some fast growing function $f(t)$. Moreover, our proof is short and simple.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. Very recently, Louis, Newman, and Ray gave an SDP-based algorithm with $O^*(\sqrt[5]{n})$ colours. We present two simple polynomial-time algorithms that find an LO colouring with $O(\log_2(n))$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

      <title>Excluding a clique or a biclique in graphs of bounded induced matching treewidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a tree decomposition $\mathcal{T}$ of a graph $G$, let $\mu(\mathcal{T})$ denote the maximum size of an induced matching in $G$ with the property that some bag of $\mathcal{T}$ contains at least one endpoint of every edge of the matching. The induced matching treewidth of a graph $G$ is the minimum value of $\mu(\mathcal{T})$ over all tree decompositions $\mathcal{T}$ of $G$. Classes of graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth admit polynomial-time algorithms for a number of problems, including INDEPENDENT SET, $k$-COLORING, ODD CYCLE TRANSVERSAL, and FEEDBACK VERTEX SET. In this paper, we focus on combinatorial properties of such classes.
  First, we show that graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth that exclude a fixed biclique as an induced subgraph have bounded tree-independence number, which is another well-studied parameter defined in terms of tree decompositions. This sufficient condition about excluding a biclique is also necessary, as bicliques have unbounded tree-independence number. Second, we show that graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth that exclude a fixed clique have bounded chromatic number, that is, classes of graphs with bounded induced matching treewidth are $\chi$-bounded. The two results confirm two conjectures due to Lima et al. [ESA 2024].</description>

Abstract: For a graph $\Gamma$, the multiplicity of the eigenvalue $0$, denoted by $\eta(\Gamma)$, is called the nullity of $\Gamma$.
  Also the energy of $\Gamma$, denoted by $\mathcal{E}(\Gamma)$, is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of $\Gamma$. The index of a subgroup $H$ in a group $G$ is denoted by $[G:H]$.
  For a prime $p$, let $G$ be a finite $p$-solvable group whose order is divisible by $p$. Also let $\Omega_p(G)$ be the set of all $p$-singular elements of $G$.
  In this paper, we apply block theory of finite groups to show that the Cayley graph $\Gamma_p(G):=\mathrm{Cay}(G,\Omega_p(G))$ is an integral graph with $\eta(\Gamma_p(G))=|G|-[G:O_{p^\prime}(G)]$, where $O_{p^\prime}(G)$ is the largest normal subgroup of $G$ whose order is co-prime to $p$.
  We also find a lower bound for $\mathcal{E}(\Gamma_p(G))$.
  Finally, we prove that the diameter of $\Gamma_p(G)$ is at most $ |G|_p$.</description>

      <title>Additive energies of subsets of discrete cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n \geq 2$, define $t_n$ to be the smallest number such that the additive energy $E(A)$ of any subset $A \subset \{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}^d$ and any $d$ is at most $|A|^{t_n}$. Trivially we have $t_n \leq 3$ and $$ t_n \geq 3 - \log_n\frac{3n^3}{2n^3+n} $$ by considering $A = \{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}^d$. In this note, we investigate the behavior of $t_n$ for large $n$ and obtain the following non-trivial bounds: $$ 3 - (1+o_{n\rightarrow\infty}(1)) \log_n \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4} \leq t_n \leq 3 - \log_n(1+c), $$ where $c&gt;0$ is an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>Connected components and non-bipartiteness of generalized Paley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the class of Cayley graphs known as generalized Paley graphs (GP-graphs for short) given by $\Gamma(k,q) = Cay(\mathbb{F}_q, \{x^k : x\in \mathbb{F}_q^* \})$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is a finite field with $q$ elements, both in the directed and undirected case. Hence $q=p^m$ with $p$ prime, $m\in \mathbb{N}$ and one can assume that $k\mid q-1$. We first give the connected components of an arbitrary GP-graph. We show that these components are smaller GP-graphs all isomorphic to each other (generalizing a Lim and Praeger's result from 2009 to the directed case). We then characterize those GP-graphs which are disjoint unions of odd cycles. Finally, we show that $\Gamma(k,q)$ is non-bipartite except for the graphs $\Gamma(2^m-1,2^m)$, $m \in \mathbb{N}$, which are isomorphic to $K_2 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup K_2$, the disjoint union of $2^{m-1}$ copies of $K_2$.</description>

      <title>The chain algebra of a pure poset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the chain algebra, originally defined in \cite{GN} for finite distributive lattices to that of finite pure posets. We show this algebra corresponds to the Ehrhart ring of a (0,1)-polytope, termed the chain polytope, and characterize the indecomposability of this polytope. Furthermore, we prove the normality of the chain algebra, describe its canonical module, and extend one of main results from \cite{GN} by computing its Krull dimension. For width-2 pure posets, we determine the algebra's regularity and conditions for it to be Gorenstein or nearly Gorenstein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Gy\'arf\'as (1976), which asserts that any family of trees $T_1, \dots, T_{n}$ where each $T_k$ has $k$ vertices packs into $K_n$. We do so by translating the decomposition problem into a labeling problem, namely complete labeling. Our proof employs the polynomial method using a functional reformulation of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Induced subgraphs and tree decompositions XVI. Complete bipartite induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every graph $G$ with a sufficiently large complete bipartite induced minor, either $G$ has an induced minor isomorphic to a large wall, or $G$ contains a large constellation; that is, a complete bipartite induced minor model such that on one side of the bipartition, each branch set is a singleton, and on the other side, each branch set induces a path.
  We further refine this theorem by characterizing the unavoidable induced subgraphs of large constellations as two types of highly structured constellations. These results will be key ingredients in several forthcoming papers of this series.</description>

      <title>M\"obius invariant Y-systems (cluster structures) for Miquel dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Miquel dynamics is a discrete time dynamics for circle patterns, which relies on Miquel's six circle theorem. Previous work shows that the evolution of the circle centers satisfy the dSKP equation on the octahedral lattice $A_3$. As a consequence, Miquel dynamics is a discrete integrable system. Moreover, Miquel dynamics give rise to a real-valued cluster structure. The evolution of the cluster variables under Miquel dynamics is also called a Y-system in the discrete integrable systems community. If the Y-system is real positive-valued then the circle pattern is accompanied by an invariant dimer model, an exactly solvable model studied in statistical physics. However, while circle patterns are M\"obius invariant, the circle centers and the Y-system are not M\"obius invariant, which violates the so called transformation group principle. In this article we show that half the intersection points satisfy the dSKP equation as well, and we introduce two new real-valued Y-systems for Miquel dynamics that involve only the intersection points. Therefore, the new Y-systems are M\"obius invariant, and thus satisfy the transformation group principle. We also show that the circle centers and intersection points combined satisfy the dSKP equation on the 4-dimensional octahedral lattice $A_4$. In addition, we present two more complex-valued Y-systems for Miquel dynamics, which are real-valued in and only in the case of integrable circle patterns. We also investigate the special cases of harmonic embeddings and s-embeddings, which relate to the spanning tree and Ising model respectively.</description>

      <title>An application of node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality to a protein complex hypernetwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of graph centrality measures applied to biological networks, such as protein interaction networks, underpins much research into identifying key players within biological processes. This approach however is restricted to dyadic interactions and it is well-known that in many instances interactions are polyadic. In this study we illustrate the merit of using hypergraph centrality applied to a hypernetwork as an alternative. Specifically, we review and propose an extension to a recently introduced node and edge nonlinear hypergraph centrality model which provides mutually dependent node and edge centralities. A Saccharomyces Cerevisiae protein complex hypernetwork is used as an example application with nodes representing proteins and hyperedges representing protein complexes. The resulting rankings of the nodes and edges are considered to see if they provide insight into the essentiality of the proteins and complexes. We find that certain variations of the model predict essentiality more accurately and that the degree-based variation illustrates that the centrality-lethality rule extends to a hypergraph setting. In particular, through exploitation of the models flexibility, we identify small sets of proteins densely populated with essential proteins. One of the key advantages of applying this model to a protein complex hypernetwork is that it also provides a classification method for protein complexes, unlike previous approaches which are only concerned with classifying proteins.</description>

      <title>Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields, integral and fractional MDS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields. These new bounds give upper bounds on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they attain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the integral case. For small parameters, we provide exhaustive computational results for additive MDS codes, by classifying the corresponding (fractional) subspace-arcs. This includes a complete classification of fractional additive MDS codes of size 243 over the field of order 9.</description>

      <title>Gathering Information about a Graph by Counting Walks from a Single Vertex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a vertex $v$ in a connected graph $G$ is decisive if the numbers of walks from $v$ of each length determine the graph $G$ rooted at $v$ up to isomorphism among all connected rooted graphs with the same number of vertices. On the other hand, $v$ is called ambivalent if it has the same walk counts as a vertex in a non-isomorphic connected graph with the same number of vertices as $G$. Using the classical constructions of cospectral trees, we first observe that ambivalent vertices exist in almost all trees. If a graph $G$ is determined by spectrum and its characteristic polynomial is irreducible, then we prove that all vertices of $G$ are decisive. Note that both assumptions are conjectured to be true for almost all graphs. Without using any assumption, we are able to prove that the vertices of a random graph are with high probability distinguishable from each other by the numbers of closed walks of length at most 4. As a consequence, the closed walk counts for lengths 2, 3, and 4 provide a canonical labeling of a random graph. Answering a question posed in chemical graph theory, we finally show that all walk counts for a vertex in an $n$-vertex graph are determined by the counts for the $2n$ shortest lengths, and the bound $2n$ is here asymptotically tight.</description>

      <title>Stable functions and F{\o}lner's Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is an amenable group and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>

      <title>Random spanning trees in random environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new spanning tree model called the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE), which interpolates between the uniform spanning tree and the minimum spanning tree as the inverse temperature (disorder strength) $\beta$ varies. On the complete graph with $n$ vertices and i.i.d.\ uniform disorder variables on the edges, we identify: (1) a low disorder regime with $\beta \leq C n/\log n$, where the diameter of the random spanning tree is typically of order $n^{1/2}$, the same as for the uniform spanning tree; (2) a high disorder regime with $\beta \geq n^{4/3} \log n$, where the diameter is typically of order $n^{1/3}$, the same as for the minimum spanning tree. We conjecture that for $\beta=n^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (1, 4/3)$, the diameter is of order $n^{\gamma+o(1)}$ for some $\gamma=\gamma(\alpha)$ strictly between $1/2$ and $1/3$.</description>

      <title>Local limits of random spanning trees in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the edge overlap and local limit of the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE) on the complete graph with $n$ vertices and weights given by $\exp(-\beta \omega_e)$ for $\omega_e$ uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. We show that for $\beta$ growing with $\beta = o(n/\log n)$, the edge overlap is $(1+o(1)) \beta$, while for $\beta$ much larger than $n \log^2 n$, the edge overlap is $(1-o(1))n$. Furthermore, there is a transition of the local limit around $\beta = n$. When $\beta = o(n/ \log n)$ the RSTRE locally converges to the same limit as the uniform spanning tree, whereas for $\beta$ larger than $n \log^\lambda n$, where $\lambda = \lambda(n) \rightarrow \infty$ arbitrarily slowly, the local limit of the RSTRE is the same as that of the minimum spanning tree.</description>
