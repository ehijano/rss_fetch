      <title>Relativistic compact stars coupled with dark energy in Heintzmann spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature suggests that dark energy is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe due to its negative pressure, therefore, dark energy can be used as a possible option to prevent the gravitational collapse of compact objects into singularities. In this regard, there is a great possibility that dark energy can interact with the compact stellar matter configuration [Phys. Rev. D 103, 084042 (2021)]. In this article, we introduce a physically viable model for celestial compact stars made of isotropic baryonic matter and isotropic dark energy with Heintzmann's ansatz [Zeitschrift f\"ur Physik 228, 489-493 (1969)] in the context of Einstein's gravity. Here, the density of dark energy is assumed to be proportional to the density of baryonic matter. The main focus of the present article is to see the effects of dark energy on the physical properties of the stars. We perform an in-depth analysis of the physical attributes of the model, such as metric function, density, pressure, mass-radius relation, compactness parameter, gravitational and surface redshifts, along with the energy conditions for three well-known compact stars. We analyse the equilibrium of the present model via the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the stability with the help of the adiabatic index and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov's static stability condition. Moreover, we estimate the solutions representing the maximum masses and the predicted surface radii from the M-R graph for different values of the coupling parameter {\alpha}. All the analyses ensure that the present model is non-singular and physically viable by satisfying all the essential conditions.</description>

      <title>The fundamental physical importance of generic off-diagonal solutions and Grigori Perelman entropy in the Einstein gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational field equations in general relativity (GR) consist of a sophisticated system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Solving such equations in some generic off-diagonal forms is usually a hard analytic or numeric task. Physically important solutions in GR were constructed using a diagonal ansatz for metrics with a maximum of 4 independent coefficients. The Einstein equations can be solved in exact or parametric forms determined by some integration constants for corresponding assumptions on spherical or cylindrical spacetime symmetries. The anholonomic frame and connection deformation method allows us to construct generic off-diagonal solutions described by 6 independent coefficients of metrics depending, in general, on all spacetime coordinates. New types of exact and parametric solutions are determined by generating and integration functions and (effective) generating sources. They may describe vacuum gravitational and matter fields solitonic hierarchies; locally anisotropic polarizations of physical constants for black holes, wormholes, black toruses, or cosmological solutions; various types of off-diagonal deformations of horizons, etc. The additional degrees of freedom (related to off-diagonal coefficients) can be used to describe dark energy and dark matter configurations and elaborate locally anisotropic cosmological scenarios. In general, the generic off-diagonal solutions do not involve certain hypersurface or holographic configurations and can't be described in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamic paradigm. We argue that generalizing the concept of G. Perelman's entropy for relativistic Ricci flows allows us to define and compute geometric thermodynamic variables for all possible classes of solutions in GR.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions and microscopic interactions in quasi-topological black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the thermodynamic geometry of four-dimensional quasi-topological black holes by computing the Ruppeiner scalar curvature R which serves as an empirical tool to describe the nature of interactions among black hole microstructures. In four dimensions, we write novel black hole solutions within the framework of generalized quasi-topological gravity, extended through a fundamental p-form field. Temperature, entropy, and thermodynamic volume are explicitly expressed using the extended first law. The nature of the interactions between the microstructure is then revealed by computing R, where positive curvature indicates repulsion dominant interactions and negative curvature indicates the dominance of attraction. Our approach uses divergences and sign changing nature of R to identify critical points and phase transitions. Further, our analysis reveals a notably streamlined thermodynamic behavior, a single zero-crossing of curvature R, marking a second-order phase transition and offering direct insight into the underlying microstructure interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Thermodynamics and Plasma Lensing in Non-Minimally Coupled Symmetric Teleparallel Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and optical signatures of electrically charged black holes (BHs) in symmetric teleparallel gravity (STPG) with non-minimal electromagnetic coupling, incorporating quantum corrections and plasma dispersion effects. The BH solution, characterized by a coupling parameter $k$, generalizes the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime through power-law modifications to electromagnetic terms in the metric function. We implement exponential corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the form $S = S_0 + e^{-S_0}$ and derive quantum-corrected expressions for fundamental thermodynamic quantities including internal energy, Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies, pressure, enthalpy, and heat capacity. Our analysis reveals rich phase transition structures with second-order transitions occurring at critical horizon radii for specific coupling values, demonstrating enhanced thermodynamic instability under strong non-minimal coupling effects. The quantum-corrected Joule-Thomson expansion analysis identifies distinct cooling and heating regimes separated by inversion points that shift systematically with the coupling parameter $k$. We analyze the efficiency of heat engines operating in Carnot cycles, finding that electromagnetic charge enhances thermodynamic performance with efficiency values approaching 99\% for optimal configurations in this geometry. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we derive analytical expressions for gravitational deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, revealing how non-minimal coupling and plasma dispersion create frequency-dependent lensing signatures that differ substantially from general relativity predictions.</description>

      <title>Inference with finite time series II: the window strikes back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth window functions are often applied to strain data when inferring the parameters describing the astrophysical sources of gravitational-wave transients. Within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, it is conventional to include a term to account for power loss due to this window in the likelihood function. We show that the inclusion of this factor leads to biased inference. The simplest solution to this, omitting the factor, leads to unbiased posteriors and Bayes factor estimates provided the window does not suppress the signal for signal-to-noise ratios $\lesssim O(100)$, but unreliable estimates of the absolute likelihood. Instead, we propose a multi-stage method that yields consistent estimates for the absolute likelihood in addition to unbiased posterior distributions and Bayes factors for signal-to-noise ratios $\lesssim O(1000)$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the commonly held wisdom that using rectangular windows necessarily leads to biased inference is incorrect.</description>

      <title>Echoes and quasinormal modes of asymmetric black bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes and echoes of symmetric and asymmetric black bounce solutions generated by anisotropic fluids within the framework of general relativity. We derive the effective potential governing massless scalar fields and compute the corresponding quasinormal mode spectra using three independent methods: sixth-order WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and time-domain evolution. Our results show that symmetric black bounce configurations with horizons yield a standard single-barrier potential, while horizonless solutions may exhibit multiple potential barriers that generate gravitational wave echoes. These echoes are sensitive to model parameters such as the fluid energy density and the regularizing parameter $a$ that defines the minimal $2$-sphere. The asymmetric models considered recover the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in their external region but can be bounded or unbounded in the inside, depending on the sign of a parameter. Both cases have similar qualitative properties as far as wave emission is concerned but show no echoes. This makes it very difficult to distinguish them from standard Reissner-Nordstr\"om configurations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Detailed Analyses for DC readout and a Fabri-P\'erot gravitational-wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum expectation value and the stationary noise spectral density for a Fabri-P\'erot gravitational-wave detector with a DC readout scheme are discussed in detail only through the quantum electrodynamics of lasers and the Heisenberg equations of mirrors' motion. We demonstrate that the initial conditions of the mirrors' motion concentrate around the fundamental frequency of the pendulum and are not related to the frequency range of our interest. Although in the ideal case, there is a consensus that the shot noise for the laser in the high-frequency range in the signal-referred noise spectral density decreases if the injected laser power is increased, our obtained noise spectral density shows that the shot noise does not decrease even if the injected laser power is increased. This is due to the leakage of the classical radiation pressure forces from the classical carrier field to the output port, and the classical carrier field is used as the reference in the DC readout scheme. Since the classical radiation pressure forces affect the mirror motion as a classical constant force, this classical constant force changes the equilibrium point of the pendulum of mirrors' motion. To recover the ideal case, we must consider adjusting the interferometer's tuning point to place the mirrors in equilibrium points. We investigate the case where the equilibrium tuning is incomplete and show that the behavior of the above shot noise is due to this incompleteness. We also discuss the maximal deviation of the mirror displacements from the equilibrium point in the incomplete tuning to recover the near ideal case.</description>

      <title>Einstein's Equations in Electromagnetic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Plebanski's 1960 mapping is extended to encode the full Einstein system in an electromagnetic medium. This is achieved by identifying transformation parameters in terms of the ADM constraint and evolution equations, and subsequently applying the mapping to the entire system. These transformed equations are then linearized in vacuum to derive gravitational-wave analogues as perturbations within the optical medium.</description>

      <title>ACT inflation and its influence on reheating era in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the observational viability of non-minimally coupled scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity, during inflation and post-inflationary reheating dynamics, from the perspective of the latest ACT-DR6 combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO data. It turns out that the ACT result considerably affects the inflationary e-fold number compared to the case where only Planck 2018 data is taken into account. The viable parameter spaces corresponding to the inflationary ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO substantially influence the reheating phenomenology via the reheating equation of state ($w_\mathrm{eff}$) and the reheating temperature. In particular, the ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO data seems to disfavor $w_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 1/3$ during the reheating stage, which is unlike to that of only Planck 2018 case. These reveal how the ACT-DR6 data hits the early universe phenomenology from inflation to reheating in the context of higher curvature like scalar-Einstein-GB theory of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the stability properties of ultracompact spinning boson stars with a stable light ring using fully nonlinear 3+1 and 2+1 numerical relativity simulations and two different formulations of the Einstein equations. We find no evidence of an instability on timescales of $t \mu \sim 10^4$ (in units of the scalar mass), when allowing the star to be perturbed either solely by discretization error or by imposing various types of perturbations to our initial data. We find that the initially imposed perturbations exhibit slow decay, even for magnitudes just below the order where immediate collapse is induced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massless vector and scalar Green's functions are obtained in closed form for a plane gravitational wave spacetime using three independent methods: direct solution of the Green-function equation and construction via the DeWitt and Hadamard recursive schemes. The results coincide exactly with the DeWitt--Schwinger expansion, indicating no massless particles production in this background. Contrasting interpretations, based on Bogolyubov coefficient calculations predicting massless particle creation, are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA): Advancing the U.S. Priorities in Gravitational-wave and Lunar Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) is a next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) facility on the Moon. By harnessing the Moon's unique environment, LILA fills a critical observational gap in the mid-band GW spectrum ($0.1 - 10$ Hz) between terrestrial detectors (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA) and the future space mission LISA. Observations enabled by LILA will fundamentally transform multi-messenger astrophysics and GW probes of fundamental physics. LILA will measure the lunar deep interior better than any existing planetary seismic instruments. The LILA mission is designed for phased development aligned with capabilities of the U.S.'s Commercial Lunar Payload Services and Artemis programs. LILA is a unique collaboration between universities, space industries, U.S. government laboratories, and international partners.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Models with Gauss-Bonnet Coupling in Light of ACT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data with other cosmological datasets report a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, creating tension with a wide range of inflationary models. Since a Gauss-Bonnet term with a coupling function $\xi(\phi) = 3\lambda/[4V(\phi)]$ leaves $n_s$ nearly unchanged (up to a field rescaling) while reducing the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by a factor $(1-\lambda)$, so choosing $(1-\lambda)$ sufficiently small effectively removes $r$ as a limiting observable, making it easier for inflationary models to satisfy the latest observational constraints and alleviating this tension. Applying this mechanism to chaotic inflation, E-models, T-models, and hilltop inflation, we find that broad regions of parameter space become consistent with the latest ACT-based CMB constraints. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet couplings can help bring a broad class of inflationary models into agreement with current CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>Unification of Gravity and Standard Model: Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a unified (quantum) description by the gauge principle of gravity and Standard Model (SM), that extends the Dirac-Born-Infeld action to the SM and Weyl geometry in $d$ dimensions, hereafter called Weyl-Dirac-Born-Infeld action (WDBI). This action is a general gauge theory of SM and Weyl group (of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry), in the Weyl gauge covariant (metric) formulation of Weyl geometry. The theory is SM and Weyl gauge invariant in arbitrary $d$ dimensions, hence there is no Weyl anomaly. The action has the unique elegant feature, not present in other gauge theories or even in string theory, that it is mathematically well-defined in $d$ dimensions, with no need to introduce a UV regulator (scale or field). The WDBI action actually {\it predicts} that gravity, through (Weyl covariant) space-time curvature, acts as UV regulator of both SM and gravity in $d=4$. A series expansion of the WDBI action (in dimensionless couplings) recovers in the leading order the Weyl gauge invariant action of SM and Weyl (gauge theory of) quadratic gravity. The SM and Einstein-Hilbert gravity are recovered in the Stueckelberg broken phase of Weyl gauge symmetry, which also restores Riemannian geometry below Planck scale. Sub-leading orders are suppressed by powers of (dimensionless) gravitational coupling ($\xi$) of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

Abstract: We report the performance of a newly implemented fourth-order accurate finite-volume HLLC Riemann solver in the adaptive-mesh-refinement numerical relativity code {\tt SACRA-MPI}. First, we validate our implementation in one-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics tests, i.e., a simple wave and shock tube test, which have analytic solutions. We demonstrate that the fourth-order convergence is achieved for the smooth flow, which cannot be achieved in our original second-order accurate finite-volume Riemann solver. We also show that our new solver is robust for the strong shock wave emergence problem. Second, we validate the implementation in a dynamical spacetime by demonstrating that {\tt SACRA-MPI} perfectly preserves the $\pi$-symmetry without imposing the $\pi$-symmetry in a short-term ($\sim 20~{\rm ms}$ in the inspiral and subsequent post-merger phase) non-spinning equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulations. Finally, we quantify the accuracy of $\approx 28$ cycles inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers by conducting a resolution study with $\approx 78, 94$, $118$, and $135$ m. We find that the fourth-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.1\pm{0.05}$--$2.4\pm{0.27}$, i.e., slightly evolving with time, in the inspiral gravitational wave phase, while the second-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.0\pm{0.5}$. The residual phase error towards the continuum limit at the merger is $0.27\pm 0.07$ rad and $0.58\pm 0.22$ rad out of a total phase of $\approx 176$ rad, respectively, for the fourth- and second-order accurate Riemann solver.</description>

      <title>The On-shell Gravity Action and Linear Dilaton Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing the Euclidean spacetime action on-shell provides a useful way of both testing holographic proposals and determining the string theory sphere partition function. We consider families of three-dimensional linear dilaton spacetimes for which there are holographic proposals that share features of a $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT. We extend the holographic renormalization program beyond AdS to this class of geometries by identifying the boundary terms needed for a well-defined variational principle and a finite on-shell action. We show that the spacetime energy or mass determined from the on-shell action matches the $T\overline{T}$-deformed two-dimensional CFT energy. This provides more evidence for the role of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation in this holographic correspondence.</description>

      <title>Probes for String-Inspired Foam, Lorentz, and CPT Violations in Astrophysics</title>

Abstract: Lorentz invariance is such a basic principle in fundamental physics that it must be constantly tested and that any proposal of its violation and breakdown of CPT symmetry, that might characterize some approaches to quantum gravity, should be treated with care. In this review we examine, among other scenarios, such instances in supercritical~(Liouville) string theory, particularly in some brane models for ``quantum foam''. Using the phenomenological formalism introduced here, we analyze the observational hints of Lorentz violation in time-of-flight lags of cosmic photons and neutrinos which fit excellently stringy space-time foam scenarios. We further demonstrate how stringent constraints from other astrophysical data, including the recent first detections of multi-TeV events in $\gamma$-ray burst 221009A and PeV cosmic photons by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory~(LHAASO), are satisfied in this context. Such models thus provide a unified framework for all currently observed phenomenologies of space-time symmetry breaking at Planckian scales.</description>

      <title>Extra-natural production of superheavy Kaluza-Klein particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.</description>

Abstract: Dynamics of gravity interaction with matter at one-loop level of effective quantum field theory naturally sets the cut-off scale $\Lambda_E$ in a sub-Planckian region through incorporating the gauge coupling constant $\alpha(\Lambda_E)$ and the reduced Planckian mass $\tilde m_\text{pl}$ into relation $ \Lambda_E\sim \tilde m_\text{pl}\,\alpha(\Lambda_E)/(4\pi)$ numerically yielding $\Lambda_E\sim 10^{16}$ GeV. Such two scales are empirically inherent for an inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the velocity response of a table-top EPR Speedmeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers is fundamentally limited by quantum noise, as dictated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, due to their continuous position measurement of the end mirrors. Speedmeter configurations, which measure mirror velocity rather than position, have been proposed as a means to suppress quantum back-action noise, but practical implementations remain at an early stage. In this work, we present a table-top realisation of the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Speedmeter concept, employing an optical readout scheme based on two orthogonal polarisation modes that probe the interferometer with different effective bandwidths. Using a triangular cavity, we demonstrate that the differential optical response between the linear p- and s-polarised modes exhibits a speed-like frequency dependence: vanishing at DC and increasing linearly with signal frequency, up to the bandwidth of the slower mode. With this we show that an optical system equivalent to the EPR Speedmeter indeed performs a velocity readout of the end mirror.</description>

      <title>$T\bar{T}$ braneworld holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a constructive gravitational dual of two-dimensional $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs) grounded in their two-dimensional gravity description. This framework can be viewed as a Randall-Sundrum-type braneworld, where two-dimensional gravity localized on the $AdS_3$ boundary is dynamical. Assuming the AdS/CFT correspondence, the holographic dictionary provides a straightforward translation between the $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT and its gravitational dual. In particular, this $T\bar{T}$ braneworld holography remains valid in the presence of matter. To clarify how our framework relates to -- and differs from -- the cutoff AdS proposal, we examine, in the absence of matter, the effect of dynamical boundary gravity on the bulk geometry. In general, semiclassical integration of the boundary two-dimensional gravity -- weighted by the massive gravity action -- leads to a deformation of the two-dimensional metric on constant-radial surfaces. However, we find that the surface commonly interpreted as the cutoff emerges dynamically as a characteristic bulk surface on which the deformation is neutralized. This perspective opens the door to possible extensions of our framework to incorporate matter effects on the bulk surface in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic thermal devices offer a unique platform for understanding the interplay between motion, quantum fields, and thermodynamics, revealing phenomena inaccessible to stationary systems. We consider a two-qubit SWAP heat engine whose working medium consists of inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a scalar quantum field in thermal equilibrium at a distinct temperature. Relativistic motion causes the qubits to perceive frequency-dependent effective temperatures that are either hotter or colder than their respective reservoir temperature. We show that the relativistic temperature shift, perhaps the qubit velocity, can be harnessed as a thermodynamic resource to enhance the work output and the efficiency at maximum power of the heat engine. We derive a generalized second law for a heat engine with a moving working medium and demonstrate that it can exceed the standard Carnot bound defined by rest-frame temperatures.</description>

      <title>Kinematic flow from the flow of cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wavefunction coefficients of conformally coupled scalars in power-law FRW cosmologies satisfy differential equations governed by a set of simple combinatorial rules known as the kinematic flow. In this paper we derive the kinematic flow, expressed using a set of differential forms referred to as the cut basis, from a geometric perspective, relying solely on the cosmological hyperplane arrangement and without invoking bulk physics. Each element of the cut basis corresponds to the positive geometry associated to an independent cut of the physical FRW-form and can be labeled by decorating (minors of) the truncated Feynman graph with an acyclic orientation. We provide a straightforward prescription to associate a logarithmic differential form to each element of the cut basis by considering its corresponding decorated graph. Moreover, we show that the residues of the physical FRW-form are canonical forms of certain graphical zonotopes labeled by the same set of decorated graphs. These zonotopes control the cut combinatorics -- flow of cuts -- of the physical FRW-form and the cut basis (by construction). Using the theory of relative twisted cohomology and intersection theory, we derive a closed form formula for the differential equations of the cut basis. We also introduce combinatorial rules that compute the kinematic differential of any basis element without explicit calculation. The combinatorics of our differential equations is a natural consequence of the flow of cuts and is equivalent (up to rescaling) to the kinematic flow for the recently studied time integral basis. In particular, our differential equations decouple into exponentially many sectors, one for each way of cutting a subset of edges of the graph.</description>

Abstract: We study the impact of fragmentation on the cosmic string loop number density, using an approach inspired by the three-scale model and a Boltzmann equation. We build a new formulation designed to be more amenable to numerical resolution and present two complementary numerical methods to obtain the full loop distribution including the effect of fragmentation and gravitational radiation. We show that fragmentation generically predicts a decay of the loop number density on large scales and a deviation from a pure power-law. We expect fragmentation to be crucial for the calibration of loop distribution models.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscous cosmological models with cosmological constant: Observational constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether viscous cold dark matter (vCDM) in a $\Lambda$-dominated FLRW universe can alleviate the Hubble tension while satisfying thermodynamic constraints, examining both flat and curved geometries. We model vCDM with bulk viscosity $\zeta = \zeta_0\,(\Omega_{vc}/\Omega_{vc0})^m$, where $m$ determines the viscosity evolution and $\Omega_{vc}$ is the density parameter of vCDM. We explore two particular scenarios: constant viscosity ($m=0$), and variable viscosity ($m$ free). Using Bayesian inference, we constrain these models with the latest datasets: the Pantheon+ SN Ia sample (both with SH0ES calibration, PPS, and without it, PP), $H(z)$ measurements from CC and BAO as separate datasets, and a Gaussian prior on $H_0$ from 2022 SH0ES baseline, $H_0=73.04 \pm 1.04$ km/s/Mpc (R22 prior). We compare the models via information criteria such as AIC, BIC, DIC, and Bayesian evidence. Our results reveal that the Hubble tension persists, although it shows partial alleviation ($\sim 1\sigma$ tension) in all investigated scenarios when local measurements are included. For the flat $m=0$ case, the joint analysis yields $H_0 = 71.05^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ km/s/Mpc. Curved model initially favors $\Omega_{K0} &gt; 0$ (at more than $2\sigma$), but this preference shifts toward flatness once the PPS+R22 prior are included. Notably, the current viscosity is constrained to $\zeta_0 \sim 10^6$ Pa s in all scenarios, in agreement with the thermodynamic requirements. Although model selection via BIC and Bayesian evidence favors $\Lambda$CDM, AIC and DIC show mild support for viscous models in some datasets. Bulk viscous models moderately improve fits but neither resolve the Hubble tension nor outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. To achieve more robust constraints, future analyses should incorporate CMB observations, which are expected to break parameter degeneracies involving $m$ and $\tilde{\zeta}_0$.</description>

      <title>Shadows of generalised Hayward spacetimes : in vacuum and with plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow properties of a wide class of spacetimes arising from different parameter regimes of the generalized Hayward metric, characterized by two independent parameters $(\sigma, \kappa)$ (Phys. Rev. D 106, 044028). This metric extends the original Hayward regular black hole solution by introducing distinct mass functions in the $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components, giving rise to four types of wormholes ( which include multi-peak effective potentials), a regular black hole, and a singular black hole solutions allowing for a unified treatment of black hole mimickers. We compute the shadow radii for all spacetimes in vacuum and in the presence of plasma, using both homogeneous and non-homogeneous plasma profiles. Our results show that certain wormhole solutions particularly the Hayward-Damour-Solodukhin class can exhibit multiple photon spheres, leading to shadow features that differ significantly from the Schwarzschild black hole. When these results are compared with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr~$A^\star$, we find that regular black holes remain observationally viable but only within a narrow parameter space. In contrast, wormhole solutions with multi-peak effective potentials are more consistent with shadow constraints than those with single peaks. This contrasts with quasinormal mode studies, which favored single-barrier potentials, and may imply detectable late-time echoes in gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Hairless Black Hole by Superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplaying effects of black hole scalarization and superradiance in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model, with the scalar field possessing electric charge. Restricted to spherical symmetry, our linear analysis about a Reissner-Nordstr\"om background confirms the persistence of tachyonic scalar modes upon inclusion of electric charge. However, fully nonlinear numerical simulations reveal that the system no longer evolves into a scalarized, hairy black hole state. Instead, we find that the superradiance phenomenon (specifically the electromagnetic version of the effect) causes the scalar condensate to become fully depleted through accretion into the black hole and radiation to spatial infinity. The combination of the two effects, which we refer to as "tachyonic superradiance", may thus be seen as a particularly efficient mechanism for the extraction of energy from a black hole, exploiting both the tachyonic growth and superradiant emission. We accurately compute the amounts of energy transfer in different channels by deriving formulae for the energy fluxes of matter fields in the presence of a dynamical horizon, which are amenable for evaluation in numerical relativity calculations.</description>

      <title>Black hole destabilization via trapped quasi-normal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of non-minimal gravitational couplings, matter field perturbations on a static black hole spacetime may develop unphysical poles in their linearized equations. Physical solutions confined in the domain between the event horizon and a pole satisfy a boundary value problem, although with boundary conditions which are different from standard quasi-normal modes. We refer to them as "trapped quasi-normal modes". Focusing on a Schwarzschild black hole in Einstein-Proca theory, we find that trapped quasi-normal modes accurately capture the behavior of perturbations under time evolution. In particular, axial-vector modes are unstable, with a growth rate that increases with multipole number. More interestingly, we uncover a new instability that affects monopole perturbations. These results confirm the existence of a novel destabilization mechanism of black holes by non-minimally coupled vector fields, with potential implications to well-studied models of modified gravity and cosmology based on vector particles.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the static solutions with rotational symmetry in the nonprojectable Ho\v rava theory in \(2+1\) dimensions. We consider all inequivalent terms of the effective theory, including the cosmological constant. We find two distinct types of solutions: the first one corresponds to a Lifshitz solution, while the second one is obtained through a coordinate transformation of the equations of motion, and exhibits Lifshitz scaling only asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Regular black hole solutions in $(2 + 1)$-dimensional $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate regular black hole solutions in the (2+1)-dimensional versions of General Relativity and $f(R, T)$ gravity, both coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics. By admitting that the matter content that generates such geometries satisfies the Maxwell limit condition, we obtain a class of regular black holes that give rise to new solutions and successfully reproduce particular cases found in earlier studies of (2+1)-dimensional General Relativity. Moreover, we discover the first regular black hole solutions in (2+1)-dimensional $f(R, T)$ gravity and explore both qualitatively and quantitatively the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor present in those solutions.</description>

      <title>Stable initial conditions and analytical investigations of cosmological perturbations in a modified loop quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study cosmological perturbations in a modified theory of loop quantum cosmologies, the so-called mLQC-I model. Our purposes are two-fold: First, using a method developed by Birrell and Davies, we identify an initial state in the remote contracting phase, which turns out to be stable, minimize particle creations and diagonalize the Hamiltonian, despite the fact that at this time some modes may be still outside of the Hubble horizon and not in their adiabatic states. Second, using the uniform asymptotic approximation method, we obtain the first-order approximate solutions of the mode function in terms of either the Airy functions, or the first or second kind of cylindrical functions, depending on the values of the wavenumber. In each case, the mode function contains two integration constants, which are uniquely determined by the initial state.</description>

      <title>Constraints on multi-fluid cosmology in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity models with different observational data sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we incorporate redshift-space distortion measurement to investigate the growth of large scale structure within the framework of multi-fluid cosmology in the context of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Using three different modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity models, we compare the predictions of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity expansion history-through the Friedmann equation with Hubble and BAO data sets and constrain models parameters. Within the context of multi-fluid cosmology in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain the structure growth equation. This equation is then combined with Sigma_8 to get f_Sigma_8 predictions-which is compared with redshift-space distortion data to constrain models parameters to obtain best-fit values including Sigma_8. This involves performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for these specific forms of modified Gauss-Bonnet models.</description>

      <title>Doubly regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In addition to curvature singularities, electrovacuum black holes in general relativity exhibit thermodynamic singularities. These so-called Davies' points occur at nonextremal values of charge and spin where the heat capacity diverges and may indicate a type of theoretical incompleteness. The thermodynamic regularity of several families of static, asymptotically flat spacetimes with bounded curvature invariants is examined using a theory-agnostic framework, showing that, while they may be regular in physical space, they are generally not in phase space. The inclusion of angular momentum, via the Newman-Janis algorithm, makes the set of such "doubly regular" objects especially restrictive. It is argued that, if thermodynamic regularity is to be considered a desirable property for an astrophysical black hole, these considerations could be used to narrow down the viable pool of regular extensions to the Kerr-Newman metric.</description>

      <title>Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes. Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object was identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a neutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models, GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star origin can not be ruled out. Moreover, we use the simulation data to estimate the signatures of potential electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the systems. We find them to be too dim to be located by current wide-field surveys if only the dynamical ejecta is considered, and detectable by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory during the first two days after merger if one accounts for additional disk wind ejecta.</description>

Abstract: We describe the effort to characterize gravitational-wave searches and detector sensitivity to different types of compact binary coalescences during the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations' fourth observing run. We discuss the design requirements and example use cases for this data product, constructed from $&gt; 4.33\times10^8$ injections during O4a alone. We also identify subtle effects with high confidence, like diurnal duty cycles within detectors. This paper accompanies a public data release of the curated injection set, and the appendixes give detailed examples of how to use the publicly available data.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Multi-Wavelength Analysis of a New Dissociative Galaxy Merger: The Champagne Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new binary galaxy cluster merger, the Champagne Cluster (RM J130558.9+263048.4), using a detection method that identifies dynamically active clusters in the redMaPPer SDSS DR8 photometric galaxy cluster catalog. The Champagne Cluster exhibits the classic X-ray morphology of a post-pericenter dissociative galaxy cluster merger: an X-ray peak located between two galaxy overdensities at the same redshift. We conducted a Keck/DEIMOS survey and obtained redshifts for {\bfseries 102} member galaxies. The redshift analysis indicates a relative velocity of 411 $\pm$ 180 km/s between the two subclusters, which suggests that the merger is happening near the plane of the sky. We estimated the bulk temperature (8.20 $\pm 1.2$ keV) and total X-ray luminosity (7.29 $\pm$ 0.19 $\times$ $10^{44}$ erg $\times$ $s^{-1}$) of the intracluster medium using $\textit{Chandra}$ archival data. We used the $\textit{ClusterPyXT}$ software to make a temperature map, and we compared it to hydrodynamic simulations to constrain the time since pericenter (TSP), the impact parameter, and the mass ratio. We found two scenarios that matched our data: a returning system with an impact parameter of 0 and TSP of 2.2 Gyr, and an outbound system with an impact parameter of 500 kpc and TSP of 0.4 Gyr. Both scenarios have a mass ratio of 1:10.</description>

      <title>Modelling Gaia photometry signals of dark halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of microlensing to show that observations of binary systems, such as those made by {\it Gaia}, combined with follow-up weak lensing measurements, can provide a means to probe halos of exotic matter, possibly clumped around compact objects such as black holes. This could potentially cover a broad range of physical scenarios - from dark matter mini-halos to black holes with bosonic configurations around them, known as hair. In a dark halo-regular star binary system, assuming that light can freely propagate through the halo of the exotic matter, the companion star will produce characteristic, sizable lensing signatures due to the lens's potential deviating from a point mass gravitational potential. The signature of the multiple images, the magnification and the light-curve could be the smoking gun of such a dark halo structure. We discuss how the precise observations of the {\it Gaia} survey offer an opportunity to search for new, yet undiscovered fundamental fields interacting gravitationally with baryons.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\Lambda$CDM: 5$\sigma$ Evidence for a Dynamical Dark Energy Late-Time Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been considerable debate regarding potential evidence for the dynamical nature of dark energy (DE), particularly in light of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements released by DESI survey. In this work, we propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes, or vice versa. Our initial approach is independent of physical priors, allowing the data to determine which behavior best fits the parameters. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory known as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it within a theoretically stable framework. To this end, we incorporate the most up-to-date datasets available, including BAO measurements from DESI-DR2, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3 samples, as well as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis reveals strong and statistically significant evidence for a quintessence-phantom transition across various data combinations. \textit{The strongest evidence is found for Planck+DESI+DESY5, with a significance exceeding $\sim$5$\sigma$ in favor of a quintessence-phantom transition at $z_{\dag} = 0.493^{+0.063}_{-0.081}$}. Beyond this redshift, the EoS remains within the phantom regime, while for $z &lt; z_{\dag}$, it favors the quintessence regime. Despite this strong indication, \textit{we find that such transitions do not resolve the $H_0$ tension}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A few members of the recently-discovered class of long period transients have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars or compact binaries remain viable. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704--37 -- some of these elusive radio transients could be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems under various scenarios and show that a few could be detectable for sufficiently large chirp masses. Astrophysical implications for (non-)detections are discussed.</description>

      <title>Milliarcsecond astrometric oscillations in active galactic nuclei as a precursor of multi-messenger gravitational wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is predicted by various cosmological and evolutionary scenarios for active galactic nuclei. These objects are considered as contributors into the gravitational wave (GW) background and emitters of discrete GW bursts. Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather elusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the quasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating astrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and identified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514. We assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary systems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and applied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward coalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the discovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW emission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an ad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of J2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters consistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514 enabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital evolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future detections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in radio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a future physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we apply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for aiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a synergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving prospective GW facilities.</description>
