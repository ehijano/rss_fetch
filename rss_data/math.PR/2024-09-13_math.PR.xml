      <title>Entropy Contractions in Markov Chains: Half-Step, Full-Step and Continuous-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the speed of convergence (mixing) of a finite Markov kernel $P$ with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence (entropy). Given a Markov kernel one defines either a discrete-time Markov chain (with the $n$-step transition kernel given by the matrix power $P^n$) or a continuous-time Markov process (with the time-$t$ transition kernel given by $e^{t(P-\mathrm{Id})}$). The contraction of entropy for $n=1$ or $t=0+$ are characterized by the famous functional inequalities, the strong data processing inequality (SDPI) and the modified log-Sobolev inequality (MLSI), respectively. When $P=KK^*$ is written as the product of a kernel and its adjoint, one could also consider the ``half-step'' contraction, which is the SDPI for $K$, while the ``full-step'' contraction refers to the SDPI for $P$. The work [DMLM03] claimed that these contraction coefficients (half-step, full-step, and continuous-time) are generally within a constant factor of each other. We disprove this and related conjectures by working out a number of different counterexamples. In particular, we construct (a) a continuous-time Markov process that contracts arbitrarily faster than its discrete-time counterpart; and (b) a kernel $P$ such that $P^{m+1}$ contracts arbitrarily better than $P^m$. Hence, our main conclusion is that the four standard inequalities comparing five common notions of entropy and variance contraction are generally not improvable.
  In the process of analyzing the counterexamples, we survey and sharpen the tools for bounding the contraction coefficients and characterize properties of extremizers of the respective functional inequalities. As our examples range from Bernoulli-Laplace model, random walks on graphs, to birth-death chains, the paper is also intended as a tutorial on computing MLSI, SDPI and other constants for these types of commonly occurring Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Large deviation inequalities for the nonlinear unbalanced urn model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we consider the two-color nonlinear unbalanced urn model, under a drawing rule reinforced by an $\mathbb{R}^+$-valued concave function and an unbalanced replacement matrix. The large deviation inequalities for the nonlinear unbalanced urn model are established by using the stochastic approximation theory. As an auxiliary theory, we give a specific large deviation inequality for a general stochastic approximation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Limit Profile for the Bernoulli--Laplace Urn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the convergence to equilibrium of the Bernoulli--Laplace urn model: initially, one urn contains $k$ red balls and a second $n-k$ blue balls; in each step, a pair of balls is chosen uniform and their locations are switched. Cutoff is known to occur at $\tfrac12 n \log \min\{k, \sqrt n\}$ with window order $n$ whenever $1 \ll k \le \tfrac12 n$. We refine this by determining the limit profile: a function $\Phi$ such that \[
  d_\mathsf{TV}\bigl( \tfrac12 n \log \min\{k, \sqrt n\} + \theta n \bigr) \to
  \Phi(\theta) \quad\text{as}\quad
  n \to \infty \quad\text{for all}\quad
  \theta \in \mathbb R. \] Our main technical contribution, of independent interest, approximates a rescaled chain by a diffusion on $\mathbb R$ when $k \gg \sqrt n$, and uses its explicit law as a Gaussian process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random walk in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that starts at the origin and whose increment distribution assigns zero probability to any affine hyperplane. We solve Sylvester's problem for these random walks by showing that the probability that the first $d+2$ steps of the walk are in convex position is equal to $1-\frac{2}{(d+1)!}$. The analogous result also holds for random bridges of length $d+2$, so long as the joint increment distribution is exchangeable.</description>

      <title>The small-mass limit for some constrained wave equations with nonlinear conservative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the small-mass limit, also known as the Smoluchowski-Kramers diffusion approximation (see \cite{kra} and \cite{smolu}), for a system of stochastic damped wave equations, whose solution is constrained to live in the unitary sphere of the space of square-integrable functions on the interval $(0,L)$. The stochastic perturbation is given by a nonlinear multiplicative Gaussian noise, where the stochastic differential is understood in Stratonovich sense. Due to its particular structure, such noise not only conserves $\mathbb{P}$-a.s. the constraint, but also preserves a suitable energy functional. In the limit, we derive a deterministic system, that remains confined to the unit sphere of $L^2$, but includes additional terms. These terms depend on the reproducing kernel of the noise and account for the interaction between the constraint and the particular conservative noise we choose.</description>

      <title>On a class of exponential changes of measure for stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a mild solution $X$ to a semilinear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE), we consider an exponential change of measure based on its infinitesimal generator $L$, defined in the topology of bounded pointwise convergence. The changed measure $\mathbb{P}^h$ depends on the choice of a function $h$ in the domain of $L$. In our main result, we derive conditions on $h$ for which the change of measure is of Girsanov-type. The process $X$ under $\mathbb{P}^h$ is then shown to be a mild solution to another SPDE with an extra additive drift-term. We illustrate how different choices of $h$ impact the law of $X$ under $\mathbb{P}^h$ in selected applications. These include the derivation of an infinite-dimensional diffusion bridge as well as the introduction of guided processes for SPDEs, generalizing results known for finite-dimensional diffusion processes to the infinite-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>American option pricing using generalised stochastic hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to pricing American options using piecewise diffusion Markov processes (PDifMPs), a type of generalised stochastic hybrid system that integrates continuous dynamics with discrete jump processes. Standard models often rely on constant drift and volatility assumptions, which limits their ability to accurately capture the complex and erratic nature of financial markets. By incorporating PDifMPs, our method accounts for sudden market fluctuations, providing a more realistic model of asset price dynamics. We benchmark our approach with the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm, both in its original form and modified to include PDifMP asset price trajectories. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our PDifMP-based method not only provides a more accurate reflection of market behaviour but also offers practical advantages in terms of computational efficiency. The results suggest that PDifMPs can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of American options pricing by more closely aligning with the stochastic volatility and jumps observed in real financial markets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Non Autonomous Conformal Iterative Function Systems (NACIFS) and their limit set. Our main concern is harmonic measure and its dimensions : Hausdorff and Packing. We prove that this two dimensions are continuous under perturbations and that they verify Bowen's and Manning's type formulas. In order to do so we prove general results about measures, and more generally about positive functionals, defined on a symbolic space, developing tools from thermodynamical formalism in a non-autonomous setting.</description>

Abstract: We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantitative periodic homogenization for symmetric non-local stable-like operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homogenization for non-local operators in periodic environments has been studied intensively. So far, these works are mainly devoted to the qualitative results, that is, to determine explicitly the operators in the limit. To the best of authors' knowledge, there is no result concerning the convergence rates of the homogenization for stable-like operators in periodic environments. In this paper, we establish a quantitative homogenization result for symmetric $\alpha$-stable-like operators on $\R^d$ with periodic coefficients. In particular, we show that the convergence rate for the solutions of associated Dirichlet problems on a bounded domain $D$ is of order $$ \varepsilon^{(2-\alpha)/2}\I_{\{\alpha\in (1,2)\}}+\varepsilon^{\alpha/2}\I_{\{\alpha\in (0,1)\}}+\varepsilon^{1/2}|\log \e|^2\I_{\{\alpha=1\}}, $$ while, when the solution to the equation in the limit is in $C^2_c(D)$, the convergence rate becomes
  $$ \varepsilon^{2-\alpha}\I_{\{\alpha\in (1,2)\}}+\varepsilon^{\alpha}\I_{\{\alpha\in (0,1)\}}+\varepsilon |\log \e|^2\I_{\{\alpha=1\}}. $$ This indicates that the boundary decay behaviors of the solution to the equation in the limit affects the convergence rate in the homogenization.</description>

      <title>Conformally invariant random fields, quantum Liouville measures, and random Paneitz operators on Riemannian manifolds of even dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13925v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For large classes of even-dimensional Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$, we construct and analyze conformally invariant random fields. These centered Gaussian fields $h=h_g$, called co-polyharmonic Gaussian fields, are characterized by their covariance kernels $k$ which exhibit a precise logarithmic divergence: $|k(x,y)-\log\frac1{d(x,y)}|\le C$. They share a fundamental quasi-invariance property under conformal transformations.
  In terms of the co-polyharmonic Gaussian field $h$, we define the quantum Liouville measure, a random measure on $M$, heuristically given as $$ d\mu_g^{h}(x):= e^{\gamma h(x)-\frac{\gamma^2}2k(x,x)}\,d \text{vol}_g(x)$$ and rigorously obtained as almost sure weak limit of the right-hand side with $h$ replaced by suitable regular approximations $h_\ell, \ell\in{\mathbb N}$. In terms on the quantum Liouville measure, we define the Liouville Brownian motion on $M$ and the random GJMS operators.
  Finally, we present an approach to a conformal field theory in arbitrary even dimensions with an ansatz based on Branson's $Q$-curvature: we give a rigorous meaning to the Polyakov-Liouville measure $$ d\boldsymbol{\nu}^*_g(h) =\frac1{Z^*_g} \exp\Big(- \int \Theta\,Q_g h + m e^{\gamma h} d \text{vol}_g\Big) \exp\Big(-\frac{a_n}{2} {\mathfrak p}_g(h,h)\Big) dh, $$ and we derive the corresponding conformal anomaly.
  The set of admissible manifolds is conformally invariant. It includes all compact 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, all compact non-negatively curved Einstein manifolds of even dimension, and large classes of compact hyperbolic manifolds of even dimension. However, not every compact even-dimensional Riemannian manifold is admissible.
  Our results rely on new sharp estimates for heat kernels and higher order Green kernels on arbitrary compact manifolds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a non-local (in time) heat equation on a time-increasing parabolic set whose boundary is determined by a suitable curve. We provide a notion of solution for this equation and we study well-posedness under Dirichlet conditions outside the domain. A maximum principle is proved and used to derive uniqueness and continuity with respect to the initial datum of the solutions of the Dirichlet problem. Existence is proved by showing a stochastic representation based on the delayed Brownian motion killed on the boundary. Related properties on crossing probabilities of the delayed Brownian motion are obtained. The asymptotic behaviour of the mean square displacement of the process is determined, showing that the diffusive behaviour is anomalous.</description>

      <title>The stochastic sandpile model on complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic sandpile model (SSM) is a generalisation of the standard Abelian sandpile model (ASM), in which topplings of unstable vertices are made random. When unstable, a vertex sends one grain to each of its neighbours independently with probability $p \in (0,1)$. We study the SSM on complete graphs. Our main result is a description of the recurrent states of the model. We show that these are given by convex sums of recurrent states for the ASM. This allows us to recover a well-known result: that the number of integer lattice points in the $n$-dimensional permutation polytope is equal to the number of labeled spanning forests on $n$ vertices. We also provide a stochastic version of Dhar's burning algorithm to check if a given (stable) state is recurrent or not, which runs in linear time. Finally, we study a family of so-called "partial" SSMs, in which some vertices topple randomly, while others topple deterministically (as in the ASM, sending one grain to all neighbours). We show that this distinction is meaningful, yielding sets of recurrent states that are in general different from those of both the ASM and SSM. We also show that to get all recurrent states of the SSM, we can allow up to two vertices to topple deterministically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuing from a companion article: 'Random walks and contracting elements I: Deviation inequality and limit laws', we study random walks on metric spaces with contracting elements. We prove that random subgroups of the isometry group of a metric space is quasi-isometrically embedded into the space. We discuss this problem in two senses, namely, one involving random walks and the other involving counting problems. We also establish the genericity of contracting elements and the CLT and its converse for translation length.</description>

This interaction gives rise to complex phenomena and transitions from a central limit theory to novel statistical behaviours. Despite its intense study, there are still many aspects and phases which have not yet been identified. In this review we focus on the current status of our understanding of the transition between weak and strong disorder phases, give an account of some of the methods that the study of the model has motivated and highlight some open questions.</description>

      <title>Private Private Information</title>

Abstract: Private signals model noisy information about an unknown state. Although these signals are called "private," they may still carry information about each other. Our paper introduces the concept of private private signals, which contain information about the state but not about other signals. To achieve privacy, signal quality may need to be sacrificed. We study the informativeness of private private signals and characterize those that are optimal in the sense that they cannot be made more informative without violating privacy. We discuss implications for privacy in recommendation systems, information design, causal inference, and mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Random walks and contracting elements III: Outer space and outer automorphism group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuing from the author's previous article 'Random walks and contracting elements I', we study random walks on (possibly asymmetric) metric spaces using the bounded geodesic image property (BGIP) of certain isometries. As an application, we show that a generic outer automorphism of the free group of rank at least 3 has different forward and backward expansion factors. This answers a question of Handel and Mosher.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Structure of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14219v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new concept called uncertainty spaces which is an extended concept of probability spaces. Then, we express n-layer uncertainty which we call hierarchical uncertainty by a hierarchically constructed sequence of uncertainty spaces, called a U-sequence. We use U-sequences for providing examples that illustrate Ellsberg's paradox. We will use the category theory to get a bird's eye view of the hierarchical structure of uncertainty. We discuss maps between uncertainty spaces and maps between U-sequences, seeing that they form categories of uncertainty spaces and the category of U-sequences, respectively. We construct an endofunctor of the category of measurable spaces in order to embed a given U-sequence into it. Then, by the iterative application of the endofunctor, we construct the universal uncertainty space which may be able to serve as a basis for multi-layer uncertainty theory.</description>

      <title>On Time-Inconsistency in Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an infinite-horizon time-inconsistent mean-field game (MFG) in a discrete time setting. We first present a classic equilibrium for the MFG and its associated existence result. This classic equilibrium aligns with the conventional equilibrium concept studied in MFG literature when the context is time-consistent. Then we demonstrate that while this equilibrium produces an approximate optimal strategy when applied to the related $N$-agent games, it does so solely in a precommitment sense. Therefore, it cannot function as a genuinely approximate equilibrium strategy from the perspective of a sophisticated agent within the $N$-agent game. To address this limitation, we propose a new consistent equilibrium concept in both the MFG and the $N$-agent game. We show that a consistent equilibrium in the MFG can indeed function as an approximate consistent equilibrium in the $N$-agent game. Additionally, we analyze the convergence of consistent equilibria for $N$-agent games toward a consistent MFG equilibrium as $N$ tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Valuation Model of Chinese Convertible Bonds Based on Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of pricing Chinese convertible bonds(CCBs) using Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic programming. At each exercise time, we use the state variables of the underlying stock to regress the continuation value, and apply standard backward induction to get the coefficients from the current time to time zero. This process ultimately determines the CCB price. We then apply this pricing method in simulations and evaluate an underpriced strategy: taking long positions in the 10 most undervalued CCBs and rebalancing daily. The results show that this strategy significantly outperforms the benchmark double-low strategy. In practice, CCB issuers often use a downward adjustment clause to prevent financial distress when a put provision is triggered. Therefore, we model the downward adjustment clause as a probabilistic event that triggers the put provision, thereby integrating it with the put provision in a straightforward manner.</description>

      <title>Jump Restore Light Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms come to rescue when sampling from a complex, high-dimensional distribution by a conventional method is intractable. Even though MCMC is a powerful tool, it is also hard to control and tune in practice. Simultaneously achieving both \emph{local exploration} of the state space and \emph{global discovery} of the target distribution is a challenging task. In this work, we present a MCMC formulation that subsumes all existing MCMC samplers employed in rendering. We then present a novel framework for \emph{adjusting} an arbitrary Markov chain, making it exhibit invariance with respect to a specified target distribution. To showcase the potential of the proposed framework, we focus on a first simple application in light transport simulation. As a by-product, we introduce continuous-time MCMC sampling to the computer graphics community. We show how any existing MCMC-based light transport algorithm can be embedded into our framework. We empirically and theoretically prove that this embedding is superior to running the standalone algorithm. In fact, our approach will convert any existing algorithm into a highly parallelizable variant with shorter running time, smaller error and less variance.</description>
