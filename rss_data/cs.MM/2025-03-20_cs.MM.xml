      <title>QuMATL: Query-based Multi-annotator Tendency Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different annotators often assign different labels to the same sample due to backgrounds or preferences, and such labeling patterns are referred to as tendency. In multi-annotator scenarios, we introduce a novel task called Multi-annotator Tendency Learning (MATL), which aims to capture each annotator tendency. Unlike traditional tasks that prioritize consensus-oriented learning, which averages out annotator differences and leads to tendency information loss, MATL emphasizes learning each annotator tendency, better preserves tendency information. To this end, we propose an efficient baseline method, Query-based Multi-annotator Tendency Learning (QuMATL), which uses lightweight query to represent each annotator for tendency modeling. It saves the costs of building separate conventional models for each annotator, leverages shared learnable queries to capture inter-annotator correlations as an additional hidden supervisory signal to enhance modeling performance. Meanwhile, we provide a new metric, Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC), to evaluate how effectively models preserve annotators tendency information. Additionally, we contribute two large-scale datasets, STREET and AMER, providing averages of 4300 and 3118 per-annotator labels, respectively. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our QuMATL.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Patch-based No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Metric exploiting Weighted Structure and Texture Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the compression, transmission, and rendering of point clouds, various artifacts are introduced, affecting the quality perceived by the end user. However, evaluating the impact of these distortions on the overall quality is a challenging task. This study introduces PST-PCQA, a no-reference point cloud quality metric based on a low-complexity, learning-based framework. It evaluates point cloud quality by analyzing individual patches, integrating local and global features to predict the Mean Opinion Score. In summary, the process involves extracting features from patches, combining them, and using correlation weights to predict the overall quality. This approach allows us to assess point cloud quality without relying on a reference point cloud, making it particularly useful in scenarios where reference data is unavailable. Experimental tests on three state-of-the-art datasets show good prediction capabilities of PST-PCQA, through the analysis of different feature pooling strategies and its ability to generalize across different datasets. The ablation study confirms the benefits of evaluating quality on a patch-by-patch basis. Additionally, PST-PCQA's light-weight structure, with a small number of parameters to learn, makes it well-suited for real-time applications and devices with limited computational capacity. For reproducibility purposes, we made code, model, and pretrained weights available at https://github.com/michaelneri/PST-PCQA.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning in Hyperbolic vs. Euclidean Multimodal Contrastive Learning: Adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning methods have become increasingly important for selective concept removal in large pre-trained models. While recent work has explored unlearning in Euclidean contrastive vision-language models, the effectiveness of concept removal in hyperbolic spaces remains unexplored. This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

      <title>MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</description>
