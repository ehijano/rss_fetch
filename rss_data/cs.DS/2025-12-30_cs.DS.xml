      <title>Beyond Exact Fairness: Envy-Free Incomplete Connected Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of Envy-Free Incomplete Connected Fair Division, where exactly p vertices of an undirected graph must be allocated to agents such that each agent receives a connected share and does not envy another agent's share. Focusing on agents with additive valuations, we show that the problem remains computationally hard when parameterized by p and the number of agents. This result holds even for star graphs and with the input numbers given in unary representation, thereby resolving an open problem posed by Gahlawat and Zehavi (FSTTCS 2023).
  In stark contrast, we show that if one is willing to tolerate even the slightest amount of envy, then the problem becomes efficient with respect to the natural parameters. Specifically, we design an Efficient Parameterized Approximation Scheme parameterized by p and the number of agent types. Our algorithm works on general graphs and remains efficient even when the input numbers are provided in binary representation.</description>

      <title>Half-Approximating Maximum Dicut in the Streaming Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study streaming algorithms for the maximum directed cut problem. The edges of an $n$-vertex directed graph arrive one by one in an arbitrary order, and the goal is to estimate the value of the maximum directed cut using a single pass and small space. With $O(n)$ space, a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation can be trivially obtained for any fixed $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ using additive cut sparsifiers. The question that has attracted significant attention in the literature is the best approximation achievable by algorithms that use truly sublinear (i.e., $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$) space.
  A lower bound of Kapralov and Krachun (STOC'20) implies .5-approximation is the best one can hope for. The current best algorithm for general graphs obtains a .485-approximation due to the work of Saxena, Singer, Sudan, and Velusamy (FOCS'23). The same authors later obtained a $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation, assuming that the graph is constant-degree (SODA'25).
  In this paper, we show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, a $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation of maximum dicut value can be obtained with $n^{1-\Omega_\varepsilon(1)}$ space in *general graphs*. This shows that the lower bound of Kapralov and Krachun is generally tight, settling the approximation complexity of this fundamental problem. The key to our result is a careful analysis of how correlation propagates among high- and low-degree vertices, when simulating a suitable local algorithm.</description>

      <title>Computing parameters that generalize interval graphs using restricted modular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Lafond and Luo [MFCS 2023] defined the $\mathcal{G}$-modular cardinality of a graph $G$ as the minimum size of a partition of $V(G)$ into modules that belong to a graph class $\mathcal{G}$. We analyze the complexity of calculating parameters that generalize interval graphs when parameterized by the $\mathcal{G}$-modular cardinality, where $\mathcal{G}$ corresponds either to the class of interval graphs or to the union of complete graphs. Namely, we analyze the complexity of computing the thinness and the simultaneous interval number of a graph.
  We present a linear kernel for the Thinness problem parameterized by the interval-modular cardinality and an FPT algorithm for Simultaneous Interval Number when parameterized by the cluster-modular cardinality plus the solution size. The interval-modular cardinality of a graph is not greater than the cluster-modular cardinality, which in turn generalizes the neighborhood diversity and the twin-cover number. Thus, our results imply a linear kernel for Thinness when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity of the input graph, FPT algorithms for Thinness when parameterized by the twin-cover number and vertex cover number, and FPT algorithms for Simultaneous Interval Number when parameterized by the neighborhood diversity plus the solution size, twin-cover number, and vertex cover number. To the best of our knowledge, prior to our work no parameterized algorithms (FPT or XP) for computing the thinness or the simultaneous interval number were known.
  On the negative side, we observe that Thinness and Simultaneous Interval Number parameterized by treewidth, pathwidth, bandwidth, (linear) mim-width, clique-width, modular-width, or even the thinness or simultaneous interval number themselves, admit no polynomial kernels assuming NP $\not\subseteq$ coNP/poly.</description>

      <title>Practical Parallel Block Tree Construction: First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The block tree [Belazzougui et al., J. Comput. Syst. Sci. '21] is a compressed representation of a length-$n$ text that supports access, rank, and select queries while requiring only $O(z\log\frac{n}{z})$ words of space, where $z$ is the number of Lempel-Ziv factors of the text. In other words, its space-requirements are asymptotically similar to those of the compressed text. In practice, block trees offer comparable query performance to state-of-the-art compressed rank and select indices. However, their construction is significantly slower. Additionally, the fastest construction algorithms require a significant amount of working memory. To address this issue, we propose fast and lightweight parallel algorithms for the efficient construction of block trees. Our algorithm achieves similar speed than the currently fastest construction algorithm on one core and is up to four times faster using 64 cores. It achieves all that while requiring an order of magnitude less memory. As result of independent interest, we present a data parallel algorithm for Karp-Rabin fingerprint computation.</description>

      <title>Pseudodeterministic Algorithms for Minimum Cut Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present efficient pseudodeterministic algorithms for both the global minimum cut and minimum s-t cut problems. The running time of our algorithm for the global minimum cut problem is asymptotically better than the fastest sequential deterministic global minimum cut algorithm (Henzinger, Li, Rao, Wang; SODA 2024).
  Furthermore, we implement our algorithm in sequential, streaming, PRAM, and cut-query models, where no efficient deterministic global minimum cut algorithms are known.</description>

      <title>Circle graphs can be recognized in linear time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, the best circle graph recognition algorithm runs in almost linear time as it relies on a split decomposition algorithm that uses the union-find data-structure. We show that in the case of circle graphs, the PC-tree data-structure allows one to avoid the union-find data-structure to compute the split decomposition in linear time. As a consequence, we obtain the first linear-time recognition algorithm for circle graphs.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Distance Sensitivity Oracles and other Graph Problems on the PRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance sensitivity oracle (DSO) problem asks us to preprocess a given graph $G=(V,E)$ in order to answer queries of the form $d(x,y,e)$, which denotes the shortest path distance in $G$ from vertex $x$ to vertex $y$ when edge $e$ is removed. This is an important problem for network communication, and it has been extensively studied in the sequential settingand recently in the distributed CONGEST model. However, no prior DSO results tailored to the parallel setting were known.
  We present the first PRAM algorithms to construct DSOs in directed weighted graphs, that can answer a query in $O(1)$ time with a single processor after preprocessing. We also present the first work-optimal PRAM algorithms for other graph problems that belong to the sequential $\tilde{O}(mn)$ fine-grained complexity class: Replacement Paths, Second Simple Shortest Path, All Pairs Second Simple Shortest Paths and Minimum Weight Cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the minimal depth of an optimal prefix circuit (i.e., a zero-deficiency circuit) on $N$ inputs with fanout bounded by $k$ is ${\log_{\alpha_k} N \pm O(1)}$, where $\alpha_k$ is the unique positive root of the polynomial ${2+x+ x^2+\ldots + x^{k-2}-x^k}$. This bound was previously known in the cases $k=2$ and $k=\infty$.</description>

      <title>The Minimum Subgraph Complementation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgraph complementation is an operation that toggles all adjacencies inside a selected vertex set. Given a graph \(G\) and a target class \(\mathcal{C}\), the Minimum Subgraph Complementation problem asks for a minimum-size vertex set \(S\) such that complementing the subgraph induced by \(S\) transforms \(G\) into a graph belonging to \(\mathcal{C}\). While the decision version of Subgraph Complementation has been extensively studied and is NP-complete for many graph classes, the algorithmic complexity of its optimization variant has remained largely unexplored.
  In this paper, we study MSC from an algorithmic perspective. We present polynomial-time algorithms for MSC in several nontrivial settings. Our results include polynomial-time solvability for transforming graphs between bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs, as well as for complementing bipartite regular graphs into chordal graphs. We also show that MSC to the class of graphs of fixed degeneracy can be solved in polynomial time when the input graph is a forest. Moreover, we investigate MSC with respect to connectivity and prove that MSC to the class of disconnected graphs and to the class of 2-connected graphs can be solved in polynomial time for arbitrary inputs.</description>

      <title>Fast mixing in Ising models with a negative spectral outlier via Gaussian approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of Glauber dynamics for Ising models in which the interaction matrix contains a single negative spectral outlier. This class includes the anti-ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss model, the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on expander graphs, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with disorder of negative mean. Existing approaches to rapid mixing rely crucially on log-concavity or spectral width bounds and therefore can break down in the presence of a negative outlier.
  To address this difficulty, we develop a new covariance approximation method based on Gaussian approximation. This method is implemented via an iterative application of Stein's method to quadratic tilts of sums of bounded random variables, which may be of independent interest. The resulting analysis provides an operator-norm control of the full correlation structure under arbitrary external fields. Combined with the localization schemes of Eldan and Chen, these estimates lead to a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and near-optimal mixing time bounds in regimes where spectral width bounds fail. As a complementary result, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mixing time for low temperature anti-ferromagnetic Ising models on sparse Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs, based on the existence of gapped states as in the recent work of Sellke.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on pure dynamic programming for connectivity problems on graphs of bounded path-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give unconditional parameterized complexity lower bounds on pure dynamic programming algorithms - as modeled by tropical circuits - for connectivity problems such as the Traveling Salesperson Problem. Our lower bounds are higher than the currently fastest algorithms that rely on algebra and give evidence that these algebraic aspects are unavoidable for competitive worst case running times. Specifically, we study input graphs with a small width parameter such as treewidth and pathwidth and show that for any $k$ there exists a graph $G$ of pathwidth at most $k$ and $k^{O(1)}$ vertices such that any tropical circuit calculating the optimal value of a Traveling Salesperson round tour uses at least $2^{\Omega(k \log \log k)}$ gates. We establish this result by linking tropical circuit complexity to the nondeterministic communication complexity of specific compatibility matrices. These matrices encode whether two partial solutions combine into a full solution, and Raz and Spieker [Combinatorica 1995] previously proved a lower bound for this complexity measure.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Bicriteria Approximation Algorithm for the Art Gallery Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a polygon $H$ in the plane, the art gallery problem calls for fining the smallest set of points in $H$ from which every other point in $H$ is seen. We give a deterministic algorithm that, given any polygon $H$ with $h$ holes, $n$ rational veritces of maximum bit-length $L$, and a parameter $\delta \in(0,1)$, is guaranteed to find a set of points in $H$ of size $O\big(\OPT\cdot\log(h+2)\cdot\log (\OPT\cdot\log(h+2)))$ that sees at least a $(1-\delta)$-fraction of the area of the polygon. The running time of the algorithm is polynomial in $h$, $n$, $L$ and $\log(\frac{1}{\delta})$, where $\OPT$ is the size of an optimum solution.</description>

      <title>Coloring Hardness on Low Twin-Width Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the class $\mathcal T_4$ of graphs of twin-width at most 4 contains every finite subgraph of the infinite grid and every graph obtained by subdividing each edge of an $n$-vertex graph at least $2 \log n$ times, most NP-hard graph problems, like Max Independent Set, Dominating Set, Hamiltonian Cycle, remain so on $\mathcal T_4$. However, Min Coloring and k-Coloring are easy on both families because they are 2-colorable and 3-colorable, respectively.
  We show that Min Coloring is NP-hard on the class $\mathcal T_3$ of graphs of twin-width at most 3. This is the first hardness result on $\mathcal T_3$ for a problem that is easy on cographs (twin-width 0), on trees (whose twin-width is at most 2), and on unit circular-arc graphs (whose twin-width is at most 3). We also show that for every $k \geqslant 3$, k-Coloring is NP-hard on $\mathcal T_4$. We finally make two observations: (1) there are currently very few problems known to be in P on $\mathcal T_d$ (graphs of twin-width at most $d$) and NP-hard on $\mathcal T_{d+1}$ for some nonnegative integer $d$, and (2) unlike $\mathcal T_4$, which contains every graph as an induced minor, the class $\mathcal T_3$ excludes a fixed planar graph as an induced minor; thus it may be viewed as a special case (or potential counterexample) for conjectures about classes excluding a (planar) induced minor. These observations are accompanied by several open questions.</description>

      <title>Multiplication of 0-1 matrices via clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study applications of clustering (in particular, the $k$-center clustering problem) in the design of efficient and practical algorithms for computing an approximate and the exact arithmetic matrix product of two 0-1 rectangular matrices with clustered rows or columns, respectively. Our results in part can be regarded as an extension of the clustering-based approach to Boolean square matrix multiplication due to Arslan and Chidri (CSC 2011). First, we provide a simple and efficient deterministic algorithm for approximate matrix product of 0-1 matrices, where the additive error is proportional to the minimum maximum radius in an $\ell$-center clustering of the rows of the first matrix or an $k$-center clustering of the columns of the second matrix. Next, we use the approximation algorithm as a preprocessing after which a query asking for the exact value of an arbitrary entry in the product matrix can be answered in time proportional to the additive error. As a consequence, we obtain a simple deterministic algorithm for the exact matrix product of 0-1 matrices. We also present an improved simple deterministic algorithm for the exact product and in addition, faster analogous randomized algorithms for an approximate and the exact matrix products of 0-1 matrices based on randomized $\ell$ and $k$-center clustering.</description>

      <title>Colouring Probe $H$-Free Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NP-complete problems Colouring and k-Colouring $(k\geq 3$) are well studied on $H$-free graphs, i.e., graphs that do not contain some fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph. We research to what extent the known polynomial-time algorithms for $H$-free graphs can be generalized if we only know some of the edges of the input graph. We do this by considering the classical probe graph model introduced in the early nineties. For a graph $H$, a partitioned probe $H$-free graph $(G,P,N)$ consists of a graph $G=(V,E)$, together with a set $P\subseteq V$ of probes and an independent set $N=V\setminus P$ of non-probes, such that $G+F$ is $H$-free for some edge set $F\subseteq \binom{N}{2}$. We first fully classify the complexity of Colouring on partitioned probe $H$-free graphs and show that this dichotomy is different from the known dichotomy of Colouring for $H$-free graphs. Our main result is a dichotomy of $3$-Colouring for partitioned probe $P_t$-free graphs: we prove that the problem is polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 5$ but NP-complete if $t\geq 6$. In contrast, $3$-Colouring on $P_t$-free graphs is known to be polynomial-time solvable if $t\leq 7$ and quasi polynomial-time solvable for $t\geq 8$.</description>

      <title>An $O(n\log n)$ Algorithm for Single-Item Capacitated Lot Sizing with a One-Breakpoint All-Units Discount and Non-Increasing Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the single-item capacitated lot sizing problem with a 1-breakpoint all-units quantity discount in a monotonic setting where the purchase prices are non-increasing over the planning horizon. For this case, we establish several novel properties of the optimal solution and develop a hybrid dynamic programming approach that maintains a compact representation of the solution space by storing only essential information about the states and using linear equations for intermediate values. Our algorithm runs in \(O(n\log n)\) time, where \(n\) denotes the number of periods. Our result is an improvement over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm, which has an \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.</description>

      <title>Fare Zone Assignment on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tariff setting in public transportation networks is an important challenge. A popular approach is to partition the network into fare zones ("zoning") and fix journey prices depending on the number of traversed zones ("pricing"). In this paper, we focus on finding revenue-optimal solutions to the zoning problem for a given concave pricing function. We consider tree networks with $n$ vertices, since trees already pose non-trivial algorithmic challenges. Our main results are efficient algorithms that yield a simple $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-approximation as well as a more involved $\mathcal{O}(\log n/\log \log n)$-approximation. We show how to solve the problem exactly on rooted instances, in which all demand arises at the same source. For paths, we prove strong NP-hardness and outline a PTAS. Moreover, we show that computing an optimal solution is in FPT or XP for several natural problem parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A modified dynamic programming algorithm rapidly and accurately solves large 0/1 knapsack problems. It has computational O(nlogn), space O(nlogn) and predictable maximum error. Experimentally it's accuracy increases faster than linearly with the solution size k. Problems with k=1e3 are solved with an average maximum fractional error of 1e-4 and problems with k=1e5 with an average maximum fractional error of 1e-7. The algorithm runs in constant time for all problems with a given n. On a common desktop computer the algorithm processes n=1e3 problems in 1e-3 seconds and n=1e6 problems in 2 seconds.</description>

      <title>Computing Balanced Solutions for Large International Kidney Exchange Schemes When Cycle Length Is Unbounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In kidney exchange programmes (KEP) patients may swap their incompatible donors leading to cycles of kidney transplants. Nowadays, countries try to merge their national patient-donor pools leading to international KEPs (IKEPs). As shown in the literature, long-term stability of an IKEP can be achieved through a credit-based system. In each round, every country is prescribed a "fair" initial allocation of kidney transplants. The initial allocation, which we obtain by using solution concepts from cooperative game theory, is adjusted by incorporating credits from the previous round, yielding the target allocation. The goal is to find, in each round, an optimal solution that closely approximates this target allocation. There is a known polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal solution that lexicographically minimizes the country deviations from the target allocation if only $2$-cycles (matchings) are permitted. In practice, kidney swaps along longer cycles may be performed. However, the problem of computing optimal solutions for maximum cycle length $\ell$ is NP-hard for every $\ell\geq 3$. This situation changes back to polynomial time once we allow unbounded cycle length. However, in contrast to the case where $\ell=2$, we show that for $\ell=\infty$, lexicographical minimization is only polynomial-time solvable under additional conditions (assuming P $\neq$ NP). Nevertheless, the fact that the optimal solutions themselves can be computed in polynomial time if $\ell=\infty$ still enables us to perform a large scale experimental study for showing how stability and total social welfare are affected when we set $\ell=\infty$ instead of $\ell=2$.</description>

      <title>Computational Lower Bounds for Correlated Random Graphs via Algorithmic Contiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, this resolves a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between a pair of correlated sparse stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, this resolves a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks, without requiring a strengthened version of the low-degree conjecture as in \cite{MW23+, DHSS25+}.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Regret for Efficient Stochastic Combinatorial Semi-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) is a cornerstone of sequential decision-making framework, dominated by two algorithmic families: UCB-based and adversarial methods such as follow the regularized leader (FTRL) and online mirror descent (OMD). However, prominent UCB-based approaches like CUCB suffer from additional regret factor $\log T$ that is detrimental over long horizons, while adversarial methods such as EXP3.M and HYBRID impose significant computational overhead. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce the Combinatorial Minimax Optimal Strategy in the Stochastic setting (CMOSS). CMOSS is a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves an instance-independent regret of $O\big( (\log k)\sqrt{kmT}\big )$ when $k\leq \frac{m}{2}$ and $O\big((m-k)\sqrt{\log k\log(m-k)T}\big )$ when $k&gt;\frac{m}{2}$ under semi-bandit feedback, where $m$ is the number of arms and $k$ is the maximum cardinality of a feasible action. Crucially, this result eliminates the dependency on $\log T$ and matches the established lower bounds of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{kmT}\big)$ when $k\leq \frac{m}{2}$ and $\Omega\big((m-k)\sqrt{\log (\frac{m}{m-k}) T}\big)$ when $k&gt;\frac{m}{2}$ up to logarithmic terms of $k$ and $m$. We then extend our analysis to show that CMOSS is also applicable to cascading feedback. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate that CMOSS consistently outperforms benchmark algorithms in both regret and runtime efficiency.</description>

      <title>Graded Projection Recursion (GPR): A Framework for Controlling Bit-Complexity of Algebraic Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Graded Projection Recursion (GPR), a framework for converting certain blocked recursive algorithms into model-honest (i.e., reflects full bit complexity) near-quadratic procedures under bounded intermediate budgets. Part I gives a proof-complete {\em integral specification} of a three-band packing identity and a two-round middle-band extractor, and shows how per-node centering and sqrt-free dyadic l2 normalization (recursive invariant amplification) gives a sufficient packing base that grows linearly with the scaling depth (i.e., logarithmic bit-growth) in exact arithmetic.
  On fixed-width hardware, exact evaluation of the packed recursion generally requires either an extended-precision path or digit-band (slice) staging} that emulates b(n) bits of mantissa precision using w-bit words, incurring only polylogarithmic overhead; This leads to a soft-quadratic bit cost O(n^2) when b(n)=\Theta(\log n) in the basic 2x2 recursion). Part II introduces execution-format comparators (e.g., IEEE-754), a drift ledger, and a decision-invariance theorem that supports commensurate-accuracy claims in floating arithmetic (and that cleanly accounts for any staged/truncated auxiliary drift). Part III provides case-study reductions (LUP/solve/det/inv, LDL^T, blocked QR, SOI/SPD functions, GSEVP, dense LP/SDP IPM kernels, Gaussian process regression, and representative semiring problems) showing how to export the kernel advantage without reintroducing uncontrolled intermediate growth. Part IV abstracts admissible packings and extractors via a master condition and an easily checkable BWBM sufficient condition, and sketches extensions to multilinear/multigraded kernels and non-rounding extractors (e.g., CRT and semiring bucket projections).</description>

      <title>MVP-ORAM: a Wait-free Concurrent ORAM for Confidential BFT Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that encryption alone is not enough to protect data privacy. Access patterns, revealed when operations are performed, can also be leveraged in inference attacks. Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides access patterns by making client requests oblivious. However, existing protocols are still limited in supporting concurrent clients and Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). We present MVP-ORAM, the first wait-free ORAM protocol that supports concurrent fail-prone clients. In contrast to previous works, MVP-ORAM avoids using trusted proxies, which require additional security assumptions, and concurrency control mechanisms based on inter-client communication or distributed locks, which limit overall throughput and the capability of tolerating faulty clients. Instead, MVP-ORAM enables clients to perform concurrent requests and merge conflicting updates as they happen, satisfying wait-freedom, i.e., clients make progress independently of the performance or failures of other clients. Since wait and collision freedom are fundamentally contradictory goals that cannot be achieved simultaneously in an asynchronous concurrent ORAM service, we define a weaker notion of obliviousness that depends on the application workload and number of concurrent clients, and prove MVP-ORAM is secure in practical scenarios where clients perform skewed block accesses. By being wait-free, MVP-ORAM can be seamlessly integrated into existing confidential BFT data stores, creating the first BFT ORAM construction. We implement MVP-ORAM on top of a confidential BFT data store and show our prototype can process hundreds of 4KB accesses per second in modern clouds.</description>
