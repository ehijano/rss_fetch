      <title>ATP: Adaptive Threshold Pruning for Efficient Data Encoding in Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) offer promising capabilities for complex data tasks, but are often constrained by limited qubit resources and high entanglement, which can hinder scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Adaptive Threshold Pruning (ATP), an encoding method that reduces entanglement and optimizes data complexity for efficient computations in QNNs. ATP dynamically prunes non-essential features in the data based on adaptive thresholds, effectively reducing quantum circuit requirements while preserving high performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that ATP reduces entanglement entropy and improves adversarial robustness when combined with adversarial training methods like FGSM. Our results highlight ATPs ability to balance computational efficiency and model resilience, achieving significant performance improvements with fewer resources, which will help make QNNs more feasible in practical, resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Taking the temperature of quantum many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum many-body scar is an eigenstate of a chaotic many-body Hamiltonian that exhibits two seemingly incongruous properties: its energy eigenvalue corresponds to a high temperature, yet its entanglement structure resembles that of low-temperature eigenstates, such as ground states. Traditionally, a temperature is assigned to an energy \emph{eigenvalue} through the textbook canonical temperature-energy relationship. However, in this work, we use the \emph{eigenstate subsystem temperature} -- a recently developed quantity that assigns a temperature to an energy eigenstate, based on the structure of its reduced density matrix. For a thermal state, the eigenstate subsystem temperature is approximately equal to its canonical temperature. Given that quantum many-body scars have a ground-state-like entanglement structure, it is not immediately clear that their eigenstate subsystem temperature would be close to their canonical temperature. Surprisingly, we find that this is the case: the quantum many-body scars have approximate ``knowledge'' of their position in the spectrum encoded within their state structure.</description>

      <title>Kicking Quantum Fisher Information out of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.</description>

      <title>Theory-Independent Context Incompatibility: Quantification and Experimental Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of compatibility originally emerged as a synonym for the commutativity of observables and later evolved into the notion of measurement compatibility. In any case, however, it has remained predominantly algebraic in nature, tied to the formalism of quantum mechanics. Recently, still within the quantum domain, the concept of context incompatibility has been proposed as a resource for detecting eavesdropping in quantum communication channels. Here, we propose a significant generalization of this concept by introducing the notion of theory-independent context compatibility, a concept that is trivially satisfied by classical statistical theory but is found in conflict with quantum mechanics. Moreover, we propose a figure of merit capable of quantifying the degree of violation of theory-independent context incompatibility, and we experimentally demonstrate, using a quantum optics platform, that quantum systems can exhibit pronounced degrees of violation. Besides yielding a concept that extends to generic probabilistic theories and retrieving the notion of measurement incompatibility in the quantum domain, our results offer a promising perspective on evaluating the role of incompatibility in the manifestation of non-local correlations.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretic One-Time Programs from Geometrically Local $\text{QNC}_0$ Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to construct simulation secure one-time memories, and thus one-time programs, without computational assumptions in the presence of constraints on quantum hardware. Specifically, we build one-time memories from random linear codes and quantum random access codes (QRACs) when constrained to non-adaptive, constant depth, and $D$-dimensional geometrically-local quantum circuit for some constant $D$. We place no restrictions on the adversary's classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence time of its qubits. Notably, our construction can still be secure even in the presence of fault tolerant quantum computation as long as the input qubits are encoded in a non-fault tolerant manner (e.g. encoded as high energy states in non-ideal hardware). Unfortunately though, our construction requires decoding random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits.
  Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order $2$) along with a few key technical lemmas for a "mutual information" for collision entropies. We also develop new bounds on how much information a specific $2 \mapsto 1$ QRAC can leak about its input, which may be of independent interest as well.</description>

      <title>Liouville Fock state lattices and potential simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Liouville Fock state lattices (LFSLs) as a framework for visualizing open quantum systems through matrix representations of the Lindblad master equation (LME). By vectorizing the LME, the state evolves in a doubled Hilbert space, naturally forming a synthetic lattice. Unlike the unitary evolution of pure states, LFSL states exhibit nontrivial dynamics due to the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, featuring population drifts, sources, and sinks--paralleling stochastic classical lattices. We explore these "classical simulators" in both the Fock representation and alternative positive semidefinite representations, which more closely resemble classical probability distributions. We further demonstrate how infinite steady state manifolds can derive from frustration in the LFSL.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Mode Quantum Cryptography in a 545-Dimensional Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in quantum key distribution (QKD) with spatial modes lies in efficiently generating, manipulating, and detecting high-dimensional quantum states. Here, we present a hybrid QKD protocol that integrates entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure approaches, utilizing position and momentum correlations of photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric downconversion. Through projective measurements on one photon, the sender remotely prepares spatial modes at the receiver's end, simplifying state preparation. Detection is enhanced using advanced event-based single-photon cameras. Our scheme supports QKD in a 545-dimensional Hilbert space-the highest reported for spatial encoding-achieving 5.07 bits per coincidence in an optimized 90-mode configuration. This work demonstrates a scalable route to high-dimensional, spatially encoded quantum communication.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{Symdyn}$: an automated algebraic solution for high-order quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many significant quantum physical systems are characterized by Hamiltonians expressible as a linear combination of time-independent generators of a closed Lie algebra, $\hat{H}(t)=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\eta_{l}(t)\hat{g}_{l}$. The Wei-Norman method provides a framework for determining the coefficients of the corresponding time evolution operator in its factorized representation, $\hat{U}(t) = \prod_{l=1}^{L} e^{ \Lambda_{l}(t)\hat{g}_{l}}$. This work introduces $\texttt{symdyn}$, a Python library that automates the application of this method for high-order quantum systems ($L\geq 6$). The library efficiently computes similarity transformations and the nonlinear differential equations intrinsic to derive Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff-like relations and the time evolution of quantum systems. We demonstrate its robustness by deriving the time evolution operator for a system of two time-dependent coupled harmonic oscillators. Additionally, we specialize the library to the Lie group $\textit{SU}(N)$, showcasting its versatility with $\textit{SU}(2)$, $\textit{SU}(3)$ and $\textit{SU}(4)$ examples.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction for long chains of trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for quantum computing with long chains of trapped ions and we design quantum error correction schemes for this model. The main components of a quantum error correction scheme are the quantum code and a quantum circuit called the syndrome extraction circuit, which is executed to perform error correction with this code. In this work, we design syndrome extraction circuits tailored to our ion chain model, a syndrome extraction tuning protocol to optimize these circuits, and we construct new quantum codes that outperform the state-of-the-art for chains of about $50$ qubits. To establish a baseline under the ion chain model, we simulate the performance of surface codes and bivariate bicycle (BB) codes equipped with our optimized syndrome extraction circuits. Then, we propose a new variant of BB codes defined by weight-five measurements, that we refer to as BB5 codes, and we identify BB5 codes that achieve a better minimum distance than any BB codes with the same number of logical qubits and data qubits, such as $[[30, 4, 5]]$ and $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 codes. For a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, the $[[48, 4, 7]]$ BB5 code achieves a logical error rate per logical qubit of $5 \cdot 10^{-5}$, which is four times smaller than the best BB code in our baseline family. It also achieves the same logical error rate per logical qubit as the distance-7 surface code but using four times fewer physical qubits per logical qubit.</description>

      <title>Towards robust variational quantum simulation of Lindblad dynamics via stochastic Magnus expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel and general framework for the variational quantum simulation of Lindblad equations. Building on the close relationship between nonlinearly unraveled Lindblad dynamics, stochastic Magnus integrators, and variational quantum simulation, we propose a high-order scheme for solving the quantum state diffusion equation using exponential integrators. This formulation facilitates the simulation of wavefunction trajectories within the established framework of variational quantum algorithms for time evolution. Our algorithm significantly enhances robustness in two key aspects: the stability of the simulation with large time steps, and the reduction in the number of quantum trajectories required to accurately simulate the Lindblad dynamics in terms of the ensemble average. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical examples, including the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) with damping, the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, and the radical pair model (RPM). The precision of the simulation can be systematically improved, and its reliability is confirmed even in the highly oscillatory regime. These methods are expected to extend their applicability beyond the particular systems analyzed in this study.</description>

      <title>Order-of-magnitude extension of qubit lifetimes with a decoherence-free subspace quantum error correction code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing an efficient and robust quantum memory is central to the challenge of engineering feasible quantum computer architectures. Quantum error correction codes can solve this problem in theory, but without careful design it can introduce daunting requirements that call for machines many orders of magnitude larger than what is available today. Bringing these requirements down can often be achieved by tailoring the codes to mitigate the specific forms of noise known to be present. Using a Quantinuum H1 quantum computer, we report on a robust quantum memory design using a concatenated code, with the low-level code designed to mitigate the dominant source of memory error, and a higher-level error correction scheme to enable robust computation. The resulting encoding scheme, known as a decoherence-free subspace quantum error correction code, is characterized for long probe times, and shown to extend the memory time by over an order of magnitude compared to physical qubits.</description>

      <title>Fault tolerance against amplitude-damping noise using Bacon-Shor codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing efficient fault tolerance schemes is crucial for building useful quantum computers. Most standard schemes assume no knowledge of the underlying device noise and rely on general-purpose quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes capable of handling arbitrary errors. Biased-noise alternatives focus on only correcting a subset of some generic error basis (e.g., Pauli error basis), and lower resource needs by channeling the redundancy to dealing only with that subset. Yet, the most resource-efficient codes are expected to be those that directly target the specific noise process that afflicts the quantum device, rather than using a generic error-basis description. However, the question of whether such noise-adapted QEC protocols are amenable to fault-tolerant implementations remains largely unexplored. Here, we design a fault tolerance scheme based on the Bacon-Shor codes which can protect against amplitude-damping noise in the device. We construct a universal set of logical gadgets tolerant to multiple damping errors and estimate the fault tolerance threshold of our scheme. Our work thus establishes the possibility of achieving fault tolerance against amplitude-damping noise using noise-adapted quantum codes, while highlighting some of the unique challenges that arise in this context.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Non-Markovian Dynamics of Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing non-Markovian quantum dynamics is essential for accurately modeling open quantum systems, particularly in near-term quantum technologies. In this work, we develop a structure-preserving approach to characterizing non-Markovian evolution using the time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation, considering both linear and nonlinear formulations. To parameterize the master equation, we explore two distinct techniques: the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion, which provides an optimal basis representation of the dynamics, and neural networks, which offer a data-driven approach to learning system-environment interactions. We demonstrate our methodology using experimental data from a superconducting qubit at the Quantum Device Integration Testbed (QuDIT) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Our results show that while neural networks can capture complex dependencies, the KL expansion yields the most accurate predictions of the qubit's non-Markovian dynamics, highlighting its effectiveness in structure-preserving quantum system characterization. These findings provide valuable insights into efficient modeling strategies for open quantum systems, with implications for quantum control and error mitigation in near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Charging in Multi-Battery Systems by Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs), harnessing quantum systems to transfer and store energy, have garnered substantial attention recently, enabling potentials in enhanced charging capacity, increased charging power, and device miniaturization. However, constrained by the weak interaction between the quantum nodes, the implementations of QB networks exhibit limited charging performance. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to improving charging in multi-battery systems by capitalizing on nonreciprocity. By constructing non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm triangles to establish unidirectional energy transfer in both cascaded and parallel configurations, we can achieve a significant enhancement of the stored energy in QBs especially in the weak interaction regime. Remarkably, the nonreciprocal cascaded setups display an exponentially increasing gain in the battery energy as the charging distance lengthens compared to the reciprocal counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nonreciprocity can also lead to the same enhancement in the charging power of QBs, accelerating the charging processes. Our findings provide a practical pathway for enhancing the charging performance of QBs and exhibit the potentials for constructing efficient QB networks.</description>

      <title>Universal Defect Statistics in Counterdiabatic Quantum Critical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic driving (CD) provides a framework to reduce excitations in nonadiabatic processes. Exact CD protocols require nonlocal control fields, and CD approximations with tailored locality are needed for their implementation. However, the performance of local CD schemes remains poorly understood. We consider the local CD across a quantum phase transition at an arbitrary rate. We establish its efficiency as a function of the degree of locality and demonstrate that the resulting defect statistics exhibit universal behavior.

      <title>Hardware-efficient quantum annealing with error mitigation via classical shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) is an efficient method for finding the ground-state energy of the problem Hamiltonian. However, in practical implementation, the system suffers from decoherence. On the other hand, recently, ``Localized virtual purification" (LVP) was proposed to suppress decoherence in the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Suppose observables have spatially local support in the lattice. In that case, the requirement for LVP is to calculate the expectation value with a reduced density matrix on a portion of the total system. In this work, we propose a method to mitigate decoherence errors in QA using LVP. The key idea is to use the so-called classical shadow method to construct the reduced density matrix. Thanks to the CS, unlike the previous schemes to mitigate decoherence error for QA, we do not need either two-qubit gates or mid-circuit measurements, which means that our method is hardware-efficient.</description>

      <title>Service-the-Longest-Queue Among d Choices Policy for Quantum Entanglement Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An Entanglement Generation Switch (EGS) is a quantum network hub that provides entangled states to a set of connected nodes by enabling them to share a limited number of hub resources. As entanglement requests arrive, they join dedicated queues corresponding to the nodes from which they originate. We propose a load-balancing policy wherein the EGS queries nodes for entanglement requests by randomly sampling d of all available request queues and choosing the longest of these to service. This policy is an instance of the well-known power-of-d-choices paradigm previously introduced for classical systems such as data-centers. In contrast to previous models, however, we place queues at nodes instead of directly at the EGS, which offers some practical advantages. Additionally, we incorporate a tunable back-off mechanism into our load-balancing scheme to reduce the classical communication load in the network. To study the policy, we consider a homogeneous star network topology that has the EGS at its center, and model it as a queueing system with requests that arrive according to a Poisson process and whose service times are exponentially distributed. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the system by deriving a set of differential equations that describe the dynamics of the mean-field limit and provide expressions for the corresponding unique equilibrium state. Consistent with analogous results from randomized load-balancing for classical systems, we observe a significant decrease in the average request processing time when the number of choices d increases from one to two during the sampling process, with diminishing returns for a higher number of choices. We also observe that our mean-field model provides a good approximation to study even moderately-sized systems.</description>

      <title>Husimi phase distribution in non-Gaussian operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Husimi phase distribution, an experimentally measurable quantity, is investigated for single-mode and two-mode squeezed vacuum states. The analysis highlights that non-Gaussian operations, i.e., photon subtraction (PS), photon addition (PA) and photon catalysis (PC), are effective tools for localizing phase distribution and enhancing phase robustness in the presence of noise, while PC enhances phase sensitivity but leads to greater delocalization. The work highlights the perspective that combined effects of squeezing, beam splitter transmittance, and environmental interactions must be carefully considered when quantum state engineering protocols are designed and phase properties provide a valuable insight into this endeavour.</description>

      <title>A quantum search method for quadratic and multidimensional knapsack problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving combinatorial optimization problems is a promising application area for quantum algorithms in real-world scenarios. In this work, we extend the "Quantum Tree Generator" (QTG), previously proposed for the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, to the 0-1 Quadratic Knapsack Problem (QKP) and the Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP). The QTG constructs a superposition of all feasible solutions for a given instance and can therefore be utilized as a promising state preparation routine within amplitude amplification to produce high-quality solutions. Previously, QTG-based search was tested on the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, where it demonstrated the potential for practical quantum advantage, once quantum computers with a few hundred logical and fully connected qubits are available. Here, we evaluate the algorithm's performance on QKP and MDKP against the classical solver Gurobi. To facilitate large-scale evaluations, we employ an advanced benchmarking technique that enables runtime predictions for instances with up to 2000 variables for QKP and up to 1500 variables and 100 constraints for MDKP. Our results indicate that QTG-based search can produce high-quality solutions with competitive runtimes for QKP. However, its performance declines for MDKP, highlighting the challenges quantum algorithms face when tackling highly constrained optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Collective vacuum-Rabi splitting with an atomic spin wave coupled to a cavity mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising platform for quantum information research relies on cavity coupled atomic spin-waves, enabling efficient operations such as quantum memories, quantum light generation and entanglement distribution. In this work, we study the strong coupling between non-classical collective spin excitations generated by Raman scattering in a cold $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atomic ensemble, and a single cavity mode. We report on an intracavity spin wave to single photon conversion efficiency of up to $\chi=0.75 \pm 0.02$ in the quantum domain, as evidenced by a violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Our work establishes a relationship between the retrieval of an atomic spin wave in the non-classical regime and the vacuum-Rabi splitting. We show that this relationship emerges within the efficiency spectrum, and we finally provide the optimal operational conditions to achieve the maximum intrinsic retrieval efficiency. Our data is well reproduced by simulations based on optical Bloch equations. This work deepens the understanding of cavity-enhanced spin wave readout and its potential applications.</description>

      <title>Feedback Connections in Quantum Reservoir Computing with Mid-Circuit Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing approaches to quantum reservoir computing (QRC) can be broadly categorized into restart-based and continuous protocols. Restart-based methods require reinitializing the quantum circuit for each time step, while continuous protocols use mid-circuit measurements to enable uninterrupted information processing. A gap exists between these two paradigms: While restart-based methods naturally have high execution times due to the need for circuit reinitialization, they can employ novel feedback connections to enhance performance. In contrast, continuous methods have significantly faster execution times but typically lack such feedback mechanisms. In this work, we investigate a novel quantum reservoir computing scheme that integrates feedback connections, which can operate within the coherence time of a qubit. We demonstrate our architecture using a minimal example and evaluate memory capacity and predictive capabilities. We show that the correlation coefficient for the short-term memory task on past inputs is nonzero, indicating that feedback connections can effectively operate during continuous processing to allow the model to remember past inputs. This confirms that such feedback connections can be incorporated into continuous QRC protocols.</description>

      <title>Circuit cutting with classical side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit cutting is a technique for simulating large quantum circuits by partitioning them into smaller subcircuits, which can be executed on smaller quantum devices. The results from these subcircuits are then combined in classical post-processing to accurately reconstruct the expectation value of the original circuit. Circuit cutting introduces a sampling overhead that grows exponentially with the number of gates and qubit wires that are cut. Many recently developed quasiprobabilistic circuit cutting techniques leverage classical side information, obtained from intermediate measurements within the subcircuits, to enhance the post-processing step. In this work, we provide a formalization of general circuit cutting techniques utilizing side information through quantum instruments. With this framework, we analyze the advantage that classical side information provides in reducing the sampling overhead of circuit cutting. Surprisingly, we find that in certain scenarios, side information does not yield any reduction in sampling overhead, whereas in others it is essential for circuit cutting to be feasible at all. Furthermore, we present a lower bound for the optimal sampling overhead with side information that can be evaluated efficiently via semidefinite programming and improves on all previously known lower bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incompatibility of measurements is the key feature of quantum theory that distinguishes it from the classical description of nature. Here, we consider groups of d-outcome quantum observables with prime d represented by non-Hermitian unitary operators whose eigenvalues are d'th roots of unity. We additionally assume that these observables mutually commute up to a scalar factor being one of the d'th roots of unity. By representing commutation relations of these observables via a frustration graph, we show that for such a group, there exists a single unitary transforming them into a tensor product of generalized Pauli matrices and some ancillary mutually commuting operators. Building on this result, we derive upper bounds on the sum of the squares of the absolute values and the sum of the expected values of the observables forming a group. We finally utilize these bounds to compute the generalized geometric measure of entanglement for qudit stabilizer subspaces.</description>

      <title>Avoiding convergence stagnation in a quantum circuit evolutionary framework through an adaptive cost function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary optimization problems are emerging as potential candidates for useful applications of quantum computing. Among quantum algorithms, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is currently considered the most promising method to obtain a quantum advantage for such problems. The QAOA method uses a classical counterpart to perform optimization in a hybrid approach. In this paper, we show that the recently introduced method called quantum circuit evolutionary (QCE) also has potential for applications in binary optimization problems. This methodology is classical optimizer-free, but, for some scenarios, may have convergence stagnation as a consequence of smooth circuit modifications at each generation. To avoid this drawback and accelerate the convergence capabilities of QCE, we introduce a framework using an adaptive cost function (ACF), which varies dynamically with the circuit evolution. This procedure accelerates the convergence of the method. Applying this new approach to instances of the set partitioning problem, we show that QCE-ACF achieves convergence performance identical to QAOA but with a shorter execution time. Finally, experiments in the presence of induced noise show that this framework is quite suitable for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memories are essential for photonic quantum technologies, enabling long-distance quantum communication and serving as delay units in quantum computing. Hot atomic vapors using electromagnetically induced transparency provide a simple platform with second-long photon storage capabilities. Light-guiding structures enhance performance, but current hollow-core fiber waveguides face significant limitations in filling time, physical size, fabrication versatility, and large-scale integration potential. In this work, we demonstrate the storage of attenuated coherent light pulses in a cesium (Cs) quantum memory based on a 3D-nanoprinted hollow-core waveguide, known as a light cage (LC), with several hundred nanoseconds of storage times. Leveraging the versatile fabrication process, we successfully integrated multiple LC memories onto a single chip within a Cs vapor cell, achieving consistent performance across all devices. We conducted a detailed investigation into storage efficiency, analyzing memory lifetime and bandwidth. These results represent a significant advancement toward spatially multiplexed quantum memories and have the potential to elevate memory integration to unprecedented levels. We anticipate applications in parallel single-photon synchronization for quantum repeater nodes and photonic quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Driving electrons at needle tips strongly with quantum light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond science relies on driving electrons after photoemission with the strong optical field of a laser pulse, representing an intense classical coherent state of light. Bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) is a quantum state of light intense enough to drive strong-field physics. However, its mean optical electric field is zero, suggesting that, in a semiclassical view, electrons should not experience strong driving. The question arises if and how this quantum state of light can generate attosecond science signatures in strong-field photoemission. Here we show that the key signatures of strong-field physics - the high energy plateau and the 10-$U_\mathrm{p}$-cut-off - also appear under BSV driving of a needle tip, but only when we post-select electron energy spectra on the individual photon number of each BSV pulse. When averaging over many BSV shots, we observe broad energy spectra featuring no plateau. This suggests that BSV-driven electrons behave as if driven by an ensemble of coherent states of light. Our findings bridge strong-field physics and quantum optics, offering insights into BSV and other quantum light states. Our work paves the way for electron quantum state engineering and the use of strongly driven electrons as quantum light sensors.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Design Alternatives for Reducing Idle Time in Shor's Algorithm: A Study on Monolithic and Distributed Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shor's algorithm is one of the most prominent quantum algorithms, yet finding efficient implementations remains an active research challenge. While many approaches focus on low-level modular arithmetic optimizations, a broader perspective can provide additional opportunities for improvement. By adopting a mid-level abstraction, we analyze the algorithm as a sequence of computational tasks, enabling systematic identification of idle time and optimization of execution flow. Building on this perspective, we first introduce an alternating design approach to minimizes idle time while preserving qubit efficiency in Shor's algorithm. By strategically reordering tasks for simultaneous execution, we achieve a substantial reduction in overall execution time. Extending this approach to distributed implementations, we demonstrate how task rearrangement enhances execution efficiency in the presence of multiple distribution channels. Furthermore, to effectively evaluate the impact of design choices, we employ static timing analysis (STA) -- a technique from classical circuit design -- to analyze circuit delays while accounting for hardware-specific execution characteristics, such as measurement and reset delays in monolithic architectures and ebit generation time in distributed settings. Finally, we validate our approach by integrating modular exponentiation circuits from QRISP and constructing circuits for factoring numbers up to 64 bits. Through an extensive study across neutral atom, superconducting, and ion trap quantum computing platforms, we analyze circuit delays, highlighting trade-offs between qubit efficiency and execution time. Our findings provide a structured framework for optimizing compiled quantum circuits for Shor's algorithm, tailored to specific hardware constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous methodologies have been proposed for performing imaginary time evolution (ITE) using quantum computers. Among these, variational ITE (VITE) for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers has attracted much attention, which uses parametrized quantum circuits to mimic non-unitary dynamics. However, conventional variational quantum algorithms including VITE face challenges in achieving high accuracy due to their strong dependence on the choice of ansatz quantum circuits. Recently, the variational quantum-neural eigensolver (VQNHE), which combines the neural network (NN) with the variational quantum eigensolver, has been proposed. This approach enhances performance of estimating the expectation values of the state given by the parametrized quantum circuit and NN. In this study, we propose a variational quantum-neural hybrid ITE method (VQNHITE). Our proposal accurately estimates ITE by combining the NN and parameterized quantum circuit. We tested our approach with numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of VQNHITE relative to VITE.</description>

      <title>Accelerated VQE: Parameter Recycling for Similar Recurring Problem Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a task that requires substantial compute. We propose the use of concepts from transfer learning to considerably reduce the training time when solving similar problem instances. We demonstrate that its utilisation leads to accelerated convergence and provides a similar quality of results compared to circuits with parameters initialised around zero. Further, transfer learning works better when the distance between the source-solution is close to that of the target-solution. Based on these findings, we present an accelerated VQE approach tested on the MaxCut problem with a problem size of 12 nodes solved with two different circuits utilised. We compare our results against a random baseline and non transfer learning trained circuits. Our experiments demonstrate that transfer learning can reduce training time by around 93\% in post-training, relative to identical circuits without the use of transfer learning. The accelerated VQE approach beats the standard approach by seven, respectively nine percentage points in terms of solution quality, if the early-stopping is considered. In settings where time-to-solution or computational costs are critical, this approach provides a significant advantage, having an improved trade-off between training effort and solution quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum transduction of an rf/microwave signal to the optical domain, and viceversa, paves the way to novel technologies which exploit the advantages of each domain to perform quantum operations. Since electro-optomechanical devices implement a simultaneous coupling of a mechanical oscillator to both an rf/microwave field and an optical field, they are suitable for the realization of a quantum transducer. The membrane-in-the-middle setup is a possible solution, once that its vibrational mode is cooled down to ultra cryogenic temperature for achieving quantum operation. This work is focused on the mechanical characterization via an optical interferometric probe, down to T=18 mK, of a loss-shielded metalized membrane designed for this purpose. A stroboscopic technique has been exploited for revealing a mechanical quality factor up to 64 millions at the lowest temperature. In fact, with continuous illumination and a cryostat temperature below 1 K, the heat due to optical absorption is not efficiently dissipated anymore, and the membrane remains hotter than its environment.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer network model recognized for its efficiency in neuromorphic computing, where synapses between neurons are trained linearly. Computations in KAN are performed by generating a polynomial vector from the state vector and layer-wise trained synapses, enabling efficient processing. While KAN can be implemented on quantum computers using block encoding and Quantum Signal Processing, these methods require fault-tolerant quantum devices, making them impractical for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. We propose the Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (EVQKAN) to overcome this limitation, which emulates KAN through variational quantum algorithms. The EVQKAN ansatz employs a tiling technique to emulate layer matrices, leading to significantly higher accuracy compared to conventional Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), even with a smaller number of layers. EVQKAN achieves superior performance with a single-layer architecture, whereas QNN and VQKAN typically struggle. Additionally, EVQKAN eliminates the need for Quantum Signal Processing, enhancing its robustness to noise and making it well-suited for practical deployment on NISQ-era quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Revivals Via Projective Measurements in a Quantum Scarred System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarred systems exhibit atypical dynamical behavior, evading thermalization and featuring periodic state revivals. In this Letter, we investigate the impact of projective measurements on the dynamics in the scar subspace for the paradigmatic PXP model, revealing that they can either disrupt or enhance the revivals. Local measurements performed at random times rapidly erase the system's memory of its initial conditions, leading to fast steady-state relaxation. In contrast, a periodic monitoring amplifies recurrences and preserves the coherent dynamics over extended timescales. We identify a measurement-induced phase resynchronization, countering the natural dephasing of quantum scars, as the key mechanism underlying this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>QuCheck: A Property-based Testing Framework for Quantum Programs in Qiskit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Property-based testing has been previously proposed for quantum programs in Q# with QSharpCheck; however, this implementation was limited in functionality, lacked extensibility, and was evaluated on a narrow range of programs using a single property. To address these limitations, we propose QuCheck, an enhanced property-based testing framework in Qiskit. By leveraging Qiskit and the broader Python ecosystem, QuCheck facilitates property construction, introduces flexible input generators and assertions, and supports expressive preconditions. We assessed its effectiveness through mutation analysis on five quantum programs (2-10 qubits), varying the number of properties, inputs, and measurement shots to assess their impact on fault detection and demonstrate the effectiveness of property-based testing across a range of conditions. Results show a strong positive correlation between the mutation score (a measure of fault detection) and number of properties evaluated, with a moderate negative correlation between the false positive rate and number of measurement shots. Among the most thorough test configurations, those evaluating three properties achieved a mean mutation score ranging from 0.90 to 0.92 across all five algorithms, with the false positive rate between 0 and 0.04. QuCheck identified 36.0% more faults than QSharpCheck, with execution time reduced by 81.1%, despite one false positive. These findings underscore the viability of property-based testing for verifying quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Streaming quantum state purification for general mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given multiple copies of a mixed quantum state with an unknown, nondegenerate principal eigenspace, quantum state purification is the task of recovering a quantum state that is closer to the principal eigenstate. A streaming protocol relying on recursive swap tests has been proposed and analysed for noisy depolarized states with arbitrary dimension and noise level. Here, we show that the same algorithm applies much more broadly, enabling the purification of arbitrary mixed states with a nondegenerate principal eigenvalue. We demonstrate this through two approaches. In the first approach, we show that, given the largest two eigenvalues, the depolarized noise is the most difficult noise to purify for the recursive swap tests, thus the desirable bounds on performance and cost follow from prior work. In the second approach, we provide a new and direct analysis for the performance of purification using recursive swap tests for the more general noise. We also derive simple lower bounds on the sample complexity, showing that the recursive swap test algorithm attains optimal sample complexity (up to a constant factor) in the low-noise regime.</description>

      <title>Optimal Locality and Parameter Tradeoffs for Subsystem Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tradeoffs between the locality and parameters of subsystem codes. We prove lower bounds on both the number and lengths of interactions in any $D$-dimensional embedding of a subsystem code. Specifically, we show that any embedding of a subsystem code with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ into $\mathbb{R}^D$ must have at least $M^*$ interactions of length at least $\ell^*$, where
  \[ M^* = \Omega(\max(k,d)), \quad\text{and}\quad \ell^* = \Omega\bigg(\max\bigg(\frac{d}{n^\frac{D-1}{D}}, \bigg(\frac{kd^\frac{1}{D-1}}{n}\bigg)^\frac{D-1}{D}\bigg)\bigg). \] We also give tradeoffs between the locality and parameters of commuting projector codes in $D$-dimensions, generalizing a result of Dai and Li. We provide explicit constructions of embedded codes that show our bounds are optimal in both the interaction count and interaction length.</description>

      <title>Differential equation quantum solvers: engineering measurements to reduce cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have been proposed as a solution for efficiently solving non-linear differential equations (DEs), a fundamental task across diverse technological and scientific domains. However, a crucial milestone in this regard is to design protocols that are hardware-aware, making efficient use of limited available quantum resources. We focus here on promising variational methods derived from scientific machine learning: differentiable quantum circuits (DQC), addressing specifically their cost in number of circuit evaluations. Reducing the number of quantum circuit evaluations is particularly valuable in hybrid quantum/classical protocols, where the time required to interface and run quantum hardware at each cycle can impact the total wall-time much more than relatively inexpensive classical post-processing overhead. Here, we propose and test two sample-efficient protocols for solving non-linear DEs, achieving exponential savings in quantum circuit evaluations. These protocols are based on redesigning the extraction of information from DQC in a ``measure-first" approach, by introducing engineered cost operators similar to the randomized-measurement toolbox (i.e. classical shadows). In benchmark simulations on one and two-dimensional DEs, we report up to $\sim$ 100 fold reductions in circuit evaluations. Our protocols thus hold the promise to unlock larger and more challenging non-linear differential equation demonstrations with existing quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Chern-Euler Duality Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phase transitions are typically characterized by abrupt changes in a quantized invariant. Here we report a contrasting paradigm in non-Hermitian parity-time symmetric systems, where the topological invariant remains conserved, but its nature transitions between the Chern number, characteristic of chiral transport in complex bands, and the Euler number, which characterizes the number of nodal points in pairs of real bands. The transition features qualitative changes in the non-Abelian geometric phases during spontaneous parity-time symmetry breaking, where different quantized components become mutually convertible. Our findings establish a novel topological duality principle governing transitions across symmetry classes and reveal unique non-unitary features intertwining topology, symmetry, and non-Abelian gauge structure.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Typical States of Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute various averages over bulk geometries of quantum states prepared by the Chern-Simons path integral, for any level $k$ and compact gauge group $G$. We do so by carefully summing over all topologically distinct bulk geometries which have $n$ disjoint boundary tori and a decomposition into space$\times$time of fixed spatial topology. We find that the typical state is unentangled across any bipartition of the tori defining the boundary Hilbert space, to leading order in the complexity defining the state. This is contrary to expectations from three-dimensional gravity. Additionally, we compute an averaged wave function which captures the leading order statistics of boundary observables in the $n$ torus Chern-Simons Hilbert space. We show that this averaged state is a separable state, which implies that different boundary tori only share classical correlations for complex enough bulk geometries.</description>

Abstract: Cavity magnomechanics combines strong coupling between magnons in a dielectric material and microwave cavity photons with long-lived mechanical resonances. Forming a triple resonance condition, this hybrid quantum system promises many advantages in quantum technologies, yet has never been studied at the cryogenic temperatures required to reveal such quantum properties. We report the first observation of magnomechanics at cryogenic temperatures down to 9 K. The experiment was conducted using a YIG sphere inside a microwave cavity, where we measured both the thermomechanical motion and the temperature-dependence of the magnon linewidth.</description>

      <title>Ground states of quasi-two-dimensional correlated systems via energy expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.</description>

      <title>Many-body Localization in a Slowly Varying Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study many-body localization (MBL) in a nearest-neighbor hopping 1D lattice with a slowly varying (SV) on-site potential $U_j = \lambda\cos(\pi\alpha j^s)$ with $0&lt;s&lt;1$. The corresponding non-interacting 1D lattice model is known to have single-particle localization with mobility edges. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the MBL of this model has similar features to the conventional MBL of extensively studied random or quasiperiodic (QP) models, including the transitions of eigenstate entanglement entropy (EE) and level statistics, and the logarithmic growth of EE. To further investigate the universal properties of this MBL transition in the asymptotic regime, we implement a real-space renormalization group (RG) method. RG analysis shows a subvolume scaling $\sim L^{d_{\rm MBL}}$ with $d_{\rm MBL} \approx 1-s$ of the localization length (length of the largest thermal clusters) in this MBL phase. In addition, we explore the critical properties and find universal scalings of the EE and localization length. From these quantities, we compute the critical exponent $\nu$ using different parameters $s$ (characterizing different degrees of spatial variation of the imposed potential), finding the critical exponent staying around $\nu\approx2$. This exponent $\nu \approx 2$ is close to that of the QP model within the error bars but differs from the random model. This observation suggests that the SV model and the QP model may belong to the same universality class, which is, however, likely distinct from the random universality class.</description>

      <title>Level-anticrossing in B(E2) anomaly (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new mechanism for explaining the B(E2) anomaly was given by F. Pan \emph{et al.} (PRC, 110, 054324, 2024), which was realized in the parameter region from the SU(3) symmetry limit to the O(6) symmetry limit, and seems to be not related to the SU(3) symmetry. However, through the SU(3) analysis, a new technique proposed recently, we found that it is not so. The new mechanism is related to the level-anticrossing phenomenon, which is related to the level-crossing phenomenon in the SU(3) symmetry limit. By incorporating previous ideas, we have a more general explanatory framework for the B(E2) anomaly, which is important for understanding some higher-order interactions in the interacting boson model. Through analysis, it is shown that level-anticrossing in this mechanism mainly results from the third-order interaction $[\hat{L}\times \hat{Q}_{\chi} \times \hat{L}]^{(0)}$. Finally, the B(E2) anomaly in $^{170}$Os is also discussed by this general framework.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Accuracy of Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction Calculations using Multireference Perturbation Theory: Application to Aromatic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for quantum chemistry calculations. This method identifies electron configurations having large weights for the target state using quantum devices and allows CI calculations to be performed with the selected configurations on classical computers. In principle, the QSCI algorithm can take advantage of the ability to handle large configuration spaces while reducing the negative effects of noise on the calculated values. At present, QSCI calculations are limited by qubit noise during the input state preparation and measurement process, restricting them to small active spaces. These limitations make it difficult to perform calculations with quantitative accuracy. The present study demonstrates a computational scheme based on multireference perturbation theory calculations on a classical computer, using the QSCI wavefunction as a reference. This method was applied to ground and excited state calculations for two typical aromatic molecules, naphthalene and tetracene. The incorporation of the perturbation treatment was found to provide improved accuracy. Extension of the reference space based on the QSCI-selected configurations as a means of further improvement was also investigated.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant inter-species interaction and its effect on the position response function of cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, the position response of a particle, coupled to a bath, subjected to an external force is a topic of broad interest. A topic of further interest is two distinguishable sets of interacting particles in contact with two different baths. Here, we report the experimental evidence of the modification of the position response function (PRF) of an ensemble of cold atoms in a magneto-optical trap when it is placed alongside a dilute cloud of cold atoms of a different species. Our experiment consists of a mass-imbalanced cold atomic mixture of Potassium and Sodium atoms. We focus on the position response of Potassium atoms when subjected to a sudden displacement in the presence of a cold Sodium atomic cloud. Notably, we find that, in the underdamped regime of motion, the oscillation frequency of motion of the cold atoms changes as much as 30 $\%$ depending on the effective inter-species light-assisted interaction strength. On the other hand, in the overdamped regime, there is a reduction, as high as 10.5 $\%$ in the damping coefficient, depending on the interaction strength. Using a quantum Langevin approach, we develop a framework that aligns well with experimental results, with potential applications in mass and charge transport studies under varied physical conditions simulated in cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Casimir pressure with dissipation and quantum corrections from axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the oscillating axion field present in our environment on the Casimir pressure between two metallic plates. We take into account the finite conductivity of the boundary plates and model the interactions between matter and photons in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. This allows us to take into account dissipation in the quantum field description of this open quantum system and retrieve the Lifschitz results for the Casimir interaction between two metallic plates. We then compute the leading correction to the Lifschitz theory in inverse powers of the axion suppression scale and show that the Casimir pressure receives oscillating corrections depending on the product of the axion mass and the distance between the plates. This contribution is repulsive at large distance compared to the axion Compton wavelength as a consequence of the breaking of parity invariance by the axion dark matter background.</description>

      <title>Towards a Quantum Information Theory of Hadronization: Dihadron Fragmentation and Neutral Polarization in Heavy Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pioneer the application of quantum information theory to experimentally distinguish between classes of hadronization models. We adapt the CHSH inequality to the fragmentation of a single parton to hadron pairs, a violation of which would rule out classical dynamics of hadronization altogether. Furthermore, we apply and extend the theory of quantum contextuality and local quantum systems to the neutral polarization of a single spin-1 hadronic system, namely the light constituents of excited Sigma baryons $\Sigma^{*}_{c,b}$ formed in the fragmentation of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entropy-Driven Modifications to Holographic Dark Energy in $f(G,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a $f(G,T)$ gravity-based reconstruction of Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE). This approach extends the conventional HDE model by replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with Barrow entropy, which encapsulates quantum gravitational corrections to the geometry of black hole horizons. We explore the cosmological dynamics of a flat FRW background filled with a pressureless dust fluid, considering both conserved and non-conserved energy-momentum tensor models. To this end, we employ the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff and adopt a power-law ansatz for the scale factor. We then investigate the evolution of key cosmological parameters, including the equation-of-state parameter \( \omega_{GT} \), the deceleration parameter \( q \), and the squared sound speed $v_s^2$. Furthermore, we explore the dynamical behavior in the $\omega_{GT}-\omega'_{GT}$ space. In the case of conserved energy-momentum tensor, our findings indicate that the BHDE model evolves from a quintessence-like regime into the phantom domain. This transition supports the current accelerated expansion of the Universe and offers an improvement over the original HDE model, which does not adequately account for the observed phenomenology. The corresponding $\omega_{GT}-\omega'_{GT}$ trajectory lies within the freezing region. On the other hand, within the non-conserved framework, the BHDE model exhibits phantom-like behavior in the early Universe, subsequently evolving toward either a cosmological constant-like state or a quintessence-like regime. Notably, unlike the conserved scenario, the squared sound speed $v_s^2$ asymptotically attains positive values in the far future. Moreover, the trajectory in the $\omega_{GT}-\omega'_{GT}$ phase space displays a thawing behavior. Finally, we evaluate the observational viability of our results and compare them with predictions from alternative reconstructed DE models.</description>

      <title>The moment polytope of matrix multiplication is not maximal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moment polytopes of tensors, the study of which is deeply rooted in invariant theory, representation theory and symplectic geometry, have found relevance in numerous places, from quantum information (entanglement polytopes) and algebraic complexity theory (GCT program and the complexity of matrix multiplication) to optimization (scaling algorithms). Towards an open problem in algebraic complexity theory, we prove separations between the moment polytopes of matrix multiplication tensors and unit tensors. As a consequence, we find that matrix multiplication moment polytopes are not maximal, i.e. are strictly contained in the corresponding Kronecker polytope. As another consequence, we obtain a no-go result for a natural operational characterization of moment polytope inclusion in terms of asymptotic restriction. We generalize the separation and non-maximality to moment polytopes of iterated matrix multiplication tensors. Our result implies that tensor networks where multipartite entanglement structures beyond two-party entanglement are allowed can go beyond projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) in terms of expressivity.
  Our proof characterizes membership of uniform points in moment polytopes of tensors, and establishes a connection to polynomial multiplication tensors via the minrank of matrix subspaces. As a result of independent interest, we extend these techniques to obtain a new proof of the optimal border subrank bound for matrix multiplication.</description>

      <title>Explicit non-free tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free tensors are tensors which, after a change of bases, have free support: any two distinct elements of its support differ in at least two coordinates. They play a distinguished role in the theory of bilinear complexity, in particular in Strassen's duality theory for asymptotic rank. Within the context of quantum information theory, where tensors are interpreted as multiparticle quantum states, freeness corresponds to a type of multiparticle Schmidt decomposition. In particular, if a state is free in a given basis, the reduced density matrices are diagonal. Although generic tensors in $\mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ are non-free for $n \geq 4$ by parameter counting, no explicit non-free tensors were known until now. We solve this hay in a haystack problem by constructing explicit tensors that are non-free for every $n \geq 3$. In particular, this establishes that non-free tensors exist in $\mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$, where they are not generic.
  To establish non-freeness, we use results from geometric invariant theory and the theory of moment polytopes. In particular, we show that if a tensor $T$ is free, then there is a tensor $S$ in the GL-orbit closure of $T$, whose support is free and whose moment map image is the minimum-norm point of the moment polytope of $T$. This implies a reduction for checking non-freeness from arbitrary basis changes of $T$ to unitary basis changes of $S$. The unitary equivariance of the moment map can then be combined with the fact that tensors with free support have diagonal moment map image, in order to further restrict the set of relevant basis changes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) aiming at reconstructing the density matrix of a quantum state plays an important role in various emerging quantum technologies. Recognizing the challenges posed by imperfect measurement data, we develop a unified neural network(NN)-based approach for QST under constrained measurement scenarios, including limited measurement copies, incomplete measurements, and noisy measurements. Through comprehensive comparison with other estimation methods, we demonstrate that our method improves the estimation accuracy in scenarios with limited measurement resources, showcasing notable robustness in noisy measurement settings. These findings highlight the capability of NNs to enhance QST with constrained measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an extension of Wenzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for solving the Schr\"odinger equation. A set of coupled differential equations is obtained by considering an ansatz of the wave function with an auxiliary condition on gauging its first derivative. It is shown that the alternating perturbation method can decouple the set of differential equations, yielding the well know Bremmer series, and in addition, by virtue of improvement on amplitudes, can refine the phase of the wave function in a sequence of recursive diagonalizations. We therefore find a general quantization formula in which the geometric-optical-like physics is encoded. Whenever the ratio of the differential reflection coefficient and the classical momentum remains constant, we show that our general quantized formula will reduce to the closed-form quantization condition that agrees with the result obtained by exactly summing to all orders of the perturbative WKB series.</description>

Abstract: The Witting configuration with 40 complex rays was suggested as a possible reformulation of Penrose model with two spin-3/2 systems based on geometry of dodecahedron and used for analysis of nonlocality and contextuality in quantum mechanics. Yet another configuration with 120 quantum states is considered in presented work. Despite of different number of states both configurations can be derived from complexification of 240 minimal vectors of 8D real lattice corresponding to root system of Lie algebra $E_8$. An analysis of properties of suggested configuration of quantum states is provided using many analogies with properties of Witting configuration.</description>

      <title>Simple and high-precision Hamiltonian simulation by compensating Trotter error with linear combination of unitary operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trotter and linear-combination-of-unitary (LCU) are two popular Hamiltonian simulation methods. We propose Hamiltonian simulation algorithms using LCU to compensate Trotter error, which enjoy both of their advantages. By adding few gates after the Kth-order Trotter, we realize a better time scaling than 2Kth-order Trotter. Our first algorithm exponentially improves the accuracy scaling of the Kth-order Trotter formula. In the second algorithm, we consider the detailed structure of Hamiltonians and construct LCU for Trotter errors with commutator scaling. Consequently, for lattice Hamiltonians, the algorithm enjoys almost linear system-size dependence and quadratically improves the accuracy of the Kth-order Trotter.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of deterministic and selective photon addition in a bosonic mode assisted by an ancillary qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum error correcting codes are primarily designed to protect against single-photon loss. To correct for this type of error, one can encode the logical qubit in code spaces with a definite photon parity, such as cat codes or binomial codes. Error correction requires a recovery operation that maps the error states -- which have opposite parity -- back onto the code states. Here, we realize a collection of photon-number-selective, simultaneous photon addition operations on a bosonic mode, a microwave cavity, assisted by a superconducting qubit. These operations are implemented as two-photon transitions that excite the cavity and the qubit at the same time. The additional degree of freedom of the qubit makes it possible to implement a coherent, unidirectional mapping between spaces of opposite photon parity. We present the successful experimental implementation of the drives and the phase control they enable on superpositions of Fock states. The presented technique, when supplemented with qubit reset, is suitable for autonomous quantum error correction in bosonic systems, and, more generally, opens the possibility to realize a range of non-unitary transformations on a bosonic mode.</description>

Abstract: Relating to finding possible upper bounds for the probability of error for discriminating between two quantum states, it is well-known that \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{tr}(A+B) - \mathrm{tr}|A-B|\leq 2\, \mathrm{tr}\big(f(A)g(B)\big) \end{align*} holds for every positive-valued matrix monotone function $f$, where $g(x)=x/f(x)$, and all positive definite matrices $A$ and $B$.
  In this paper, we introduce a new class of functions that satisfy the above inequality. As a consequence, we derive a novel estimation of the quantum Chernoff bound. Additionally, we characterize matrix decreasing functions and establish matrix Powers-St\"ormer type inequalities for perspective functions.</description>

      <title>Tomography of Quantum States from Structured Measurements via quantum-aware transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is the process of reconstructing the state of a quantum system (mathematically described as a density matrix) through a series of different measurements, which can be solved by learning a parameterized function to translate experimentally measured statistics into physical density matrices. However, the specific structure of quantum measurements for characterizing a quantum state has been neglected in previous work. In this paper, we explore the similarity between highly structured sentences in natural language and intrinsically structured measurements in QST. To fully leverage the intrinsic quantum characteristics involved in QST, we design a quantum-aware transformer (QAT) model to capture the complex relationship between measured frequencies and density matrices. In particular, we query quantum operators in the architecture to facilitate informative representations of quantum data and integrate the Bures distance into the loss function to evaluate quantum state fidelity, thereby enabling the reconstruction of quantum states from measured data with high fidelity. Extensive simulations and experiments (on IBM quantum computers) demonstrate the superiority of the QAT in reconstructing quantum states with favorable robustness against experimental noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study free fermion systems under adaptive quantum dynamics consisting of unitary gates and projective measurements followed by corrective unitary operations. We further introduce a classical flag for each site, allowing for an active or inactive status which determines whether or not the unitary gates are allowed to apply. In this dynamics, the individual quantum trajectories exhibit a measurement-induced entanglement transition from critical to area-law scaling above a critical measurement rate, similar to previously studied models of free fermions under continuous monitoring. Furthermore, we find that the corrective unitary operations can steer the system into a state characterized by charge-density-wave order. Consequently, an additional phase transition occurs, which can be observed at both the level of the quantum trajectory and the quantum channel. We establish that the entanglement transition and the steering transition are fundamentally distinct. The latter transition belongs to the parity-conserving (PC) universality class, arising from the interplay between the inherent fermionic parity and classical labelling. We demonstrate both the entanglement and the steering transitions via efficient numerical simulations of free fermion systems, which confirm the PC universality class of the latter.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between Information Gain and Disturbance in Local Discrimination of Entangled Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an information gain-disturbance trade-off relation in local state discrimination. Our result demonstrates a fundamental limitation of local strategy to discriminate entangled quantum states without disturbance, which becomes more difficult as the entanglement of the states to be discriminated increases. For a set of maximally entangled states, the capability of local strategy is tightly suppressed, as random guessing without measurements saturates the bound provided by the trade-off relation. We also show that the trade-off can be circumvented when local operations are aided by pre-shared entanglement. To simultaneously achieve correct guessing of state and non-disturbance, an entirely different strategy from conventional state discrimination should be adopted to lower the cost of pre-shared entanglement. We explicitly propose an adaptive and non-destructive strategy based on the stabilizer formalism, which shows a strict advantage over conventional teleportation-based approaches in pre-shared entanglement cost for discriminating a set of maximally entangled states. As an application of the trade-off relation, we propose an entanglement certification protocol that is robust against depolarizing noise and generalize it to multipartite scenarios in a quantum network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the fundamental tasks in quantum information theory is quantum data compression, which can be realized via quantum autoencoders that first compress quantum states to low-dimensional ones and then recover to the original ones with a reference state. When taking a pure reference state, there exists an upper bound for the encoding fidelity, which limits the compression of states with high entropy. To overcome the entropy inconsistency, we allow the reference state to be a mixed state and propose a cost function that combines the encoding fidelity and the quantum mutual information. We consider the reference states to be a mixture of maximally mixed states and pure states and propose three strategies for setting the ratio of mixedness. Numerical simulations of different states and experimental implementations on IBM quantum devices illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Hermitian bypass to the non-Hermitian quantum theory</title>

Abstract: Describing systems with non-Hermitian (NH) operators remains a challenge in quantum theory due to instabilities (e.g., exceptional points and decoherence) arising from interactions with the environment. We propose a framework to express the energy states of NH Hamiltonians using a well-defined basis (dub computational basis) derived from a related Hermitian operator. This suitably shifts the singularities from the basis states to the expansion coefficients, allowing for their easier mathematical treatment and parametric control. Furthermore, we introduce a `space-time' transformation on the computational basis that defines a generic dual space map for the energy states. Interestingly, this transformation leads to a symmetry for real/imaginary energy values, revealing the existence of weaker condition than hermiticity or the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. This leads to clearer understanding and novel interpretations of key features like exceptional points, dual space, and weaker symmetry-enforced real eigenvalues. The applicability of our framework extends to various branches of physics where NH operators manifest as ladder operators, order parameters, self-energies, projectors, and other entities.</description>

      <title>The i.i.d. State Convertibility in the Resource Theory of Asymmetry for Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive both the exact and approximate conversion rates between i.i.d. pure states under covariant operations in the resource theory of asymmetry for symmetries described by finite groups. We derive the formula for the exact conversion rate, and thereby identifying the relevant set of resource measures. The exact conversion is in general irreversible due to multiple independent resource measures, but we also find the condition for reversibility. On the other hand, we show that the approximate conversion rate either diverges or equals zero, which implies that the asymmetry can be amplified infinitely if we allow a vanishingly small error. We reveal the underlying mechanism of such a counterintuitive phenomenon, by showing the existence of a "uniform state" that acts as a catalysis.</description>

      <title>Virtual Channel Purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is a key approach for extracting target state properties on state-of-the-art noisy machines and early fault-tolerant devices. Using the ideas from flag fault tolerance and virtual state purification, we develop the virtual channel purification (VCP) protocol, which consumes similar qubit and gate resources as virtual state purification but offers stronger error suppression with increased system size and more noisy operation copies. The application of VCP does not require specific knowledge about the target quantum state, the target problem and the gate noise model in the target circuit, and can still offer rigorous performance guarantees for practical noise regimes as long as the noise is incoherent. Further connections are made between VCP and quantum error correction to produce the virtual error correction (VEC) protocol, one of the first protocols that combine quantum error correction (QEC) and quantum error mitigation beyond directly applying error mitigation protocols on top of logical qubits. Assuming perfect syndrome extraction, VEC can virtually remove all correctable noise in the channel while paying only the same sampling cost as low-order purification. It can achieve QEC-level protection on an unencoded register when transmitting it through a noisy channel, removing the associated encoding qubit overhead. Another variant of VEC can mimic the error suppression power of the surface code by inputting only a bit-flip and a phase-flip code. Our protocol can also be adapted to key tasks in quantum networks like channel capacity activation and entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>Unknown measurement statistics cannot be redundantly copied using finite resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements can be viewed as interactions between a measured system and a pointer system that imprint information about the system on the pointer. For so-called unbiased interactions, the measurement statistics--the information corresponding to the diagonal of the system's initial density operator--with respect to a chosen measurement basis are transferred accurately, even if the pointer is initially in a mixed state. However, establishing measurement outcomes as objective facts also requires redundancy. We therefore consider the problem of unitarily distributing the outcome statistics to several pointers or quantum memories. We show that the accuracy of this process is limited by thermodynamic restrictions on preparing the memories in pure states: exact duplication of unknown outcome statistics is impossible using finite resources. For finite-temperature memories, we put forward a lower bound on the entropy production of the duplication process. This \emph{Holevo-Landauer} bound demonstrates that the mixedness of the initial memory limits the ability to accurately transfer the same information to more than one memory component, thus fundamentally restricting the creation of redundancies while maintaining the integrity of the original information. Finally, we show how the outcome statistics can be recovered exactly in the classical limit--via coarse-graining or asymptotically as the number of subsystems of each memory component increases--thus elucidating how objective properties can emerge despite inherent imperfections.</description>

      <title>Certifying quantum enhancements in thermal machines beyond the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase as a Resource for Quantum Enhanced Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00328v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are a special phase of matter in which time translational symmetry is broken through a periodic driving pulse. Here, we first propose and characterize an effective mechanism to generate a stable discrete time crystal phase in a disorder-free many-body system with indefinite persistent oscillations even in finite-size systems. Then we explore the sensing capability of this system to measure the spin exchange coupling. The results show strong quantum-enhanced sensitivity throughout the time crystal phase. As the spin exchange coupling varies, the system goes through a sharp phase transition and enters a non-time crystal phase in which the performance of the probe considerably decreases. We characterize this phase transition as a second-order type and determine its critical properties through a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. The performance is independent of the initial states and may even benefit from imperfections in the driving pulse. A simple set of projective measurements can capture the quantum-enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Characterizing dynamical criticality of many-body localization transitions from the Fock-space perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the nature of many-body localization transitions (MBLTs) and their potential critical behaviors has remained a challenging problem. In this work, we study the dynamics of the displacement, quantifying the spread of the radial probability distribution in the Fock space, for three systems with MBLTs, i.e., the Hamiltonian models with quasiperiodic and random fields, as well as a random-circuit Floquet model of a MBLT. We then perform a finite-size scaling analysis of the long-time averaged displacement by considering two types of ansatz for MBLTs, i.e., continuous and BKT transitions. The data collapse based on the assumption of a continuous phase transition with power-law correlation length reveals that the scaling exponent of the MBLT induced by random field is close to that of the Floquet model, but significantly differes from the quasiperiodic model. Additionally, we find that the BKT-type scaling provides a more accurate description of the MBLTs in the random model and the Floquet model, yielding larger (finite-size) critical points compared to those obtained from power-law scaling. Our work highlights that the displacement is a valuable tool for studying MBLTs, as relevant to ongoing experimental efforts.</description>

      <title>Observables in non-Hermitian systems: A methodological comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite acute interest in the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems, there is a lack of consensus in the mathematical formulation of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in the community. Different methodologies are used in the literature to study non-Hermitian dynamics. This ranges from consistent frameworks like biorthogonal quantum mechanics and metric approach characterized by modified inner products, to normalization by time-dependent norms inspired by open quantum systems. In this work, we systematically explore the similarities and differences among these various methods. Utilizing illustrative models with exact solutions, we demonstrate that these methods produce not only quantitatively different results but also distinct physical interpretations. For dissipative systems where non-Hermiticity arises as an approximation, we find that simply dividing by the norm in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime closely aligns with the full master equation solutions. In contrast, for quantum systems where non-Hermiticity can be engineered exactly, incorporating metric dynamics is crucial for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, necessitating the generalizations of similarity transformations and unitarity to non-Hermitian systems. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, potentially leveraging generalized transformations for novel physical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel methodology utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to classify Markovian and non-Markovian quantum processes, leveraging time series data derived from Choi states. The model exhibits exceptional accuracy, surpassing 95%, across diverse scenarios, including dephasing and Pauli channels in an arbitrary basis, generalized amplitude damping dynamics, and even in the presence of noise. Additionally, the developed model shows efficient forecasting capabilities for the analyzed time series data. These results suggest the potential of RNNs in discerning and predicting the Markovian nature of quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Highly entangled stationary states from strong symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that the presence of strong non-Abelian conserved quantities can lead to highly entangled stationary states even for unital quantum channels. We derive exact expressions for the bipartite logarithmic negativity, R\'enyi negativities, and operator space entanglement for stationary states restricted to one symmetric subspace, with focus on the trivial subspace. We prove that these apply to open quantum evolutions whose commutants, characterizing all strongly conserved quantities, correspond to either the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra or to the Read-Saleur commutants. The latter provides an example of quantum fragmentation, whose dimension is exponentially large in system size. We find a general upper bound for all these quantities given by the logarithm of the dimension of the commutant on the smaller bipartition of the chain. As Abelian examples, we show that strong U($1$) symmetries and classical fragmentation lead to separable stationary states in any symmetric subspace. In contrast, for non-Abelian SU$(N)$ symmetries, both logarithmic and R\'enyi negativities scale logarithmically with system size. Finally, we prove that while R\'enyi negativities with $n&gt;2$ scale logarithmically with system size, the logarithmic negativity (as well as generalized R\'enyi negativities with $n&lt;2$) exhibits a volume law scaling for the Read-Saleur commutants. Our derivations rely on the commutant possessing a Hopf algebra structure in the limit of infinitely large systems, and hence also apply to finite groups and quantum groups.</description>

Abstract: In experiments requiring extreme darkness, such as experiments probing the limits of human vision, assessment of the background photon flux is essential. However, direct measurement thereof with standard single photon detectors is challenged by dark counts and their fluctuations. Here we report an experiment and detailed statistical analysis of a direct measurement of darkness in a dedicated dark chamber suitable for human vision experiments, only using a standard single photon detector and a mechanical shutter. From a Bayesian analysis of $616$ h of data, we find substantial to decisive evidence for absolute darkness (depending on choice of prior distribution) based on the Savage-Dickey ratio, and a light level $&lt;0.039$ cnt/s (posterior $0.95$-highest density interval).</description>

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles have the potential to improve a wide range of applications, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at the microscale and nanoscale, wide-field magnetometry, and hyperpolarization of nuclear spins via the transfer of optically induced NV polarization to nearby nuclear spin clusters. These NV ensembles can be coherently manipulated with microwave cavities, that deliver strong and homogeneous drivings over large volumes. However, the pulse shaping for microwave cavities presents the added challenge that the external controls and intra-cavity field amplitudes are not identical, leading to adverse effects on the accuracy of operations on the NV ensemble. In this work, we introduce a method based on Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to optimize external controls, resulting in robust pulses within the cavity while minimizing the effects of cavity ringings. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by designing both $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ pulses. These optimized controls are then integrated into a PulsePol sequence, where numerical simulations reveal a resilience to detunings five times larger than those tolerated by the sequence constructed using standard controls.</description>

Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, understanding the interplay between locality, thermal constraints, and communication remains an open challenge. In this manuscript, we introduce Local Thermal Operations and Classical Communication (LTOCC), a novel operational framework that unifies the distant laboratories paradigm with thermodynamic restrictions, defining the fundamental limits on transformations between spatially separated systems. We establish a hierarchy of LTOCC protocols, demonstrating inclusion relations between different levels and revealing their deep connection to semilocal thermal operations. To formalize this framework, we develop thermal tensors and bithermal tensors, extending tristochastic tensors to thermodynamic settings and providing new mathematical tools for constrained quantum processes. Furthermore, we explore the role of LTOCC in approximating logical gates such as CNOT and SWAP and investigate its potential to generate correlations between distant systems.</description>

Abstract: The possibility of extracting more work from a physical system thanks to the information obtained from measurements has been a topic of fundamental interest in the context of thermodynamics since the formulation of the Maxwell's demon thought experiment. We here consider this problem from the perspective of an open quantum battery interacting with an environment that can be continuously measured. By modeling it via a continuously monitored collisional model, we show how to implement the corresponding dynamics as a quantum circuit, including the final conditional feedback unitary evolution that allows to enhance the amount of work extracted. By exploiting the flexibility of IBM quantum computers and by properly modelling the corresponding quantum circuit, we experimentally simulate the work extraction protocol showing how the obtained experimental values of the daemonic extracted work are close to their theoretical upper bound quantified by the so-called daemonic ergotropy. We also demonstrate how by properly modelling the noise affecting the quantum circuit, one can improve the work extraction protocol by optimizing the corresponding extraction unitary feedback operation.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Efficient Quantum Anomaly Detection Method on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has gained attention for its potential to address computational challenges. However, whether those algorithms can effectively solve practical problems and outperform their classical counterparts, especially on current quantum hardware, remains a critical question. In this work, we propose a novel quantum machine learning method, called Parameter-Efficient Quantum Anomaly Detection (PEQAD), for practical image anomaly detection, which aims to achieve both parameter efficiency and superior accuracy compared to classical models. Emulation results indicate that PEQAD demonstrates favourable recognition capabilities compared to classical baselines, achieving an average accuracy of over 90% on benchmarks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. Theoretical analysis confirms that PEQAD has a comparable expressivity to classical counterparts while requiring only a fraction of the parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first implementation of a quantum anomaly detection method for general image datasets on a superconducting quantum processor. Specifically, we achieve an accuracy of over 80% with only 16 parameters on the device, providing initial evidence of PEQAD's practical viability in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era and highlighting its significant reduction in parameter requirements.</description>

      <title>Lindblad engineering for quantum Gibbs state preparation under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon recent progress in Lindblad engineering for quantum Gibbs state preparation algorithms, we propose a simplified protocol that is shown to be efficient under the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The ETH reduces circuit overheads of the Lindblad simulation algorithm and ensures a fast convergence toward the target Gibbs state. Moreover, we show that the realized Lindblad dynamics exhibits an inherent resilience against stochastic noise, opening up the path to a first demonstration on quantum computers. We complement our claims with numerical studies of the algorithm's convergence in various regimes of the mixed-field Ising model. In line with our predictions, we observe a mixing time scaling polynomially with system size when the ETH is satisfied. In addition, we assess the impact of algorithmic and hardware-induced errors on the algorithm's performance by carrying out quantum circuit simulations of our Lindblad simulation protocol with a local depolarizing noise model. This work bridges the gap between recent theoretical advances in dissipative Gibbs state preparation algorithms and their eventual quantum hardware implementation.</description>

      <title>Cavity enhancement of V2 centers in 4H-SiC with a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon vacancy centers in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) host a long-lived electronic spin and simultaneously possess spin-resolved optical transitions, making them a great candidate for implementing a spin-photon interface. These interfaces are an important building block of quantum networks, which in turn promise to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing. To achieve this goal, the rate of coherently scattered photons collected from a single emitter needs to be maximized, which can be achieved by interfacing the emitter with an optical cavity. In this work, we integrate V2 centers inside a SiC membrane into a fiber-based Fabry-P\'erot microcavity. We find that SiC lends itself well to membrane fabrication, as evidenced by low surface roughness $\sigma_{\mathrm{RMS}}$ ~ 400 pm, high reproducibility, and consequentially a high cavity finesse F ~ 40 000. At cryogenic temperatures, we observe individual emitters coupling to cavity modes. We confirm their single-emitter character by measuring the second-order autocorrelation function and investigate the Purcell factor by measuring the optical lifetime as a function of the cavity-emitter detuning. We find a 13.3-fold enhancement of photons scattered into the zero-phonon line (ZPL), which could be further increased by using optimized mirror coatings, potentially opening the path towards deterministic spin-photon interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop novel protocols for generating loss-tolerant quantum codes; these are central for safeguarding information against qubit losses, with most crucial applications in quantum communications. Contrary to current proposals, our method enables top-to-bottom fast encoding and decoding, thereby significantly reducing the additional losses due to the lagging and photon-reordering at the repeater stations. At the hardware level, we show how to achieve this with a single quantum emitter equipped with a static feedback mechanism, which we leverage to engineer entangling gates between a fed-back qubit and multiple emitted qubits in parallel. In addition, analyzing typical patterns within the error-correction decoding graphs, we find optimizations of the code structure, which enable higher performance by also reducing the code size; these are based on the introduction of asymmetries in the code, which mimic the intrinsic adaptiveness of the recovery procedure. We show numerically that these improvements together significantly enhance the loss-correction performance, with major advantages in quantum repeater protocols, where the fast recovery scheme (decoding-encoding) allows for improved repeater rates with smaller photon numbers per code.</description>

      <title>Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding statistics in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility of our scheme in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation of twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and opens up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</description>

Abstract: We introduce AppQSim, a benchmarking suite for quantum computers focused on applications of Hamiltonian simulation. We consider five different settings for which we define a precise task and score: condensed matter and material simulation (dynamic and static properties), nuclear magnetic resonance simulation, chemistry ground state preparation, and classical optimization. These five different benchmark tasks display different resource requirements and scalability properties. We introduce a metric to evaluate the quality of the output of a tested quantum hardware, called distinguishability cost, defined as the minimal number of gates that a perfect quantum computer would have to run to certify that the output of the benchmarked hardware is incorrect.</description>

      <title>Implementation and verification of coherent error suppression using randomized compiling for Grover's algorithm on a trapped-ion device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In near-term quantum computations that do not employ error correction, noise can proliferate rapidly, corrupting the quantum state and making results unreliable. These errors originate from both decoherence and control imprecision. The latter can manifest as coherent noise that is especially detrimental. Here, we study the impact of coherent errors and their mitigation under standard error-reduction techniques, both theoretically and experimentally on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a representative case study, we implement a range of Grover's algorithm circuits containing up to 10 qubits and 26 two-qubit gates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of randomized compiling (RC) and algorithm error detection (ED), where the latter is realized via post-selection on ancillary qubits that ideally return to the ground state at the end of each circuit. Our results highlight a synergetic effect: combining RC and ED yields the largest reductions in errors, indicating that these methods can work together to extend the capabilities of near-term quantum devices for moderately deep circuits.</description>

      <title>Variational preparation of normal matrix product states on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing matrix product states (MPSs) on quantum computers is important for a wide class of quantum algorithms including the simulation of many-body physics. However, widely-used schemes based on staircase circuits are often too deep to be run on quantum computers today. In this work, we demonstrate how normal MPSs, which have short-range correlations, can be prepared with shallow circuits using heuristics from approximate quantum compiling (AQC). We achieve this with ADAPT-AQC, an adaptive-ansatz preparation algorithm, as well as with a generalised initialisation scheme for the existing AQC-Tensor algorithm. We subsequently apply these methods to prepare an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the 50-site Heisenberg XXZ spin chain near the AFM-XY phase boundary and study the dynamics following a global quench. Through the execution of circuits with up to 59 CZ depth and 1251 CZ gates, we obtain the signature relaxation of magnetic ordering for a parameter regime previously inaccessible on quantum hardware due to deep ground state preparation circuits. Overall, our results demonstrate how the close integration of quantum and classical resources can push the boundary of what can be studied on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Performance of the spin qubit shuttling architecture for a surface code implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit shuttling promises to advance some quantum computing platforms to the qubit register sizes needed for effective quantum error correction (QEC), but also introduces additional errors whose impact must be evaluated. The established method to investigate the performance of QEC codes in a realistic scenario is to employ a standard noise model known as circuit-level noise, where all quantum operations are modeled as noisy. In the present work, we take this noise model and single out the effect of shuttling errors by introducing them as an additional so-called error location. This hardware abstraction is motivated by the SpinBus architecture and allows a systematic numerical investigation to map out the resulting two-dimensional parameter space. To this end, we take the Surface code and perform large scale simulations, most notably extracting the threshold across said two-dimensional parameter space. We study two scenarios for shuttling errors, depolarization on the one hand and dephasing on the other hand. For a purely dephasing shuttling error, we find a threshold of several percent, provided that all other operations have a high fidelity. The qubit overhead needed to reach a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$ (known as the "teraquop" regime~\cite{Gidney2021Jul}) increases only moderately for shuttling error rates up to about 1 \% per shuttling operation. The error rates at which practically useful, i.e. well below threshold error correction is predicted to be possible are comfortably higher than what is expected to be achievable for spin qubits. Our results thus show that it is reasonable to expect shuttling operations to fall below threshold already at surprisingly large error rates. With realistic efforts in the near term, this offers positive prospects for spin qubit based quantum processors as a viable avenue for scalable fault-tolerant error-corrected quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</description>

      <title>QCPINN: Quantum Classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into neural architectures. However, these classical approaches often require large number of parameters for solving complex problems or achieving reasonable accuracy. We investigate whether quantum-enhanced architectures can achieve comparable performance while significantly reducing model complexity. We propose a quantum-classical physics-informed neural network (QCPINN) combining quantum and classical components to solve PDEs with fewer parameters while maintaining comparable accuracy and training convergence. Our approach systematically evaluates two quantum circuit paradigms (e.g., continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV)) implementations with four circuit topologies (e.g., alternate, cascade, cross-mesh, and layered), two embedding schemes (e.g., amplitude and angle) on five benchmark PDEs (e.g., Helmholtz, lid-driven cavity, wave, Klein-Gordon, and convection-diffusion equations). Results demonstrate that QCPINNs achieve comparable accuracy to classical PINNs while requiring approximately 10\% trainable parameters across different PDEs, and resulting in a further 40\% reduction in relative $L_2$ error for the convection-diffusion equation. DV-based circuits with angle embedding and cascade configurations consistently exhibited enhanced convergence stability across all problem types. Our finding establishes parameter efficiency as a quantifiable quantum advantage in physics-informed machine learning. By significantly reducing model complexity while maintaining solution quality, QCPINNs represent a potential direction for overcoming computational bottlenecks in scientific computing applications where traditional approaches require large parameter spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with solid-state spin sensors is a promising pathway for the detection of nuclear spins at the micro- and nanoscale. Although many nanoscale experiments rely on a single sensor spin for the detection of the signal, leveraging spin ensembles can enhance sensitivity, particularly in cases in which the signal merely originates from statistically polarized nuclear spins. In this work, we introduce multipoint correlation spectroscopy, that combines the advantages of two well-established methods -- correlation spectroscopy and quantum heterodyne detection -- to enable temporally efficient measurements of statistically polarized samples at the nanoscale with spin ensembles. We present a theoretical framework for this approach and demonstrate an experimental proof of concept with a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. We achieve single hertz uncertainty in the estimated signal frequency, highlighting the potential applications of the technique for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00702v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a practical, ab initio time-dependent method using Hagedorn wavepackets to efficiently simulate single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra of polyatomic molecules from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. We apply the method to compute SVL spectra of anthracene by performing wavepacket dynamics on a 66-dimensional harmonic potential energy surface constructed from density functional theory calculations. The Hagedorn approach captures both mode distortion and Duschinsky rotation within the harmonic approximation. We not only reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^1$ and $\overline{11}^1$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments. Notably, all spectra were obtained from the same wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for the emission spectrum from the ground vibrational level of the electronically excited state.</description>

Abstract: Topological quantum matter exhibits a range of exotic phenomena when enriched by subdimensional symmetries. This includes new features beyond those that appear in the conventional setting of global symmetry enrichment. A recently discovered example is a type of subsystem symmetry fractionalization that occurs through a different mechanism to global symmetry fractionalization. In this work we extend the study of subsystem symmetry fractionalization through new examples derived from the general principle of embedding subsystem symmetry into higher-form symmetry. This leads to new types of symmetry fractionalization that are described by foliation dependent higher-form symmetries. This leads to field theories and lattice models that support previously unseen anomalous subsystem symmetry fractionalization. Our work expands the range of exotic topological physics that is enabled by subsystem symmetry in field theory and on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Extracting Universal Corner Entanglement Entropy during the Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subleading corner logarithmic corrections in entanglement entropy (EE) are crucial for revealing universal characteristics of the quantum critical points (QCPs), but they are challenging to detect. Motivated by recent developments in the stable computation of EE in (2+1)D quantum many-body systems, we have developed a new method for directly measuring the corner contribution in EE with less computational cost. The cornerstone of our approach is to measure the subtracted corner entanglement entropy (SCEE) defined as the difference between the EEs of subregions with the same boundary length for smooth and cornered boundaries during the sign-problem free quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Our improved method inherently eliminates not only the area law term of EE but also the subleading log-corrections arising from Goldstone modes, leaving the universal corner contribution as the leading term of SCEE with greatly improved data quality. Utilizing this advanced approach, we calculate the SCEE of the bilayer Heisenberg model on both square and honeycomb lattices across their (2+1)D O(3) QCPs with different opening angles on entanglement boundary, and obtain the accurate values of the corresponding universal corner log-coefficients. These findings will encourage further theoretical investigations to access controlled universal information for interacting CFTs at (2+1)D.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and charge fluctuations in a Fermi liquid of composite fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composite fermion Fermi liquid (CFL) state at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a Landau level is a paradigmatic non-Fermi liquid borne out purely by Coulomb interactions. But in what ways is this exotic state of matter different from a Fermi liquid? The CFL entanglement entropy was indeed found to exhibit a significant enhancement compared to free electrons [Shao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 206402 (2015)], which was subsequently ruled out as a finite-size effect by the study of a lattice CFL analog [Mishmash and Motrunich, Phys. Rev. B 94, 081110 (2016)]. Moreover, the enhancement was not observed in a quasi-one-dimensional limit of the Coulomb ground state at $\nu=1/2$ [Geraedts et al., Science 352, 197 (2016)]. Here, we revisit the problem of entanglement scaling in the CFL state realized in a two-dimensional electron gas. Using Monte Carlo evaluation of the second R\'enyi entropy $S_2$ for the CFL variational wave function, we show that the entanglement enhancement is present not only at $\nu=1/2$ but also at $\nu=1/4$, as well as in bosonic CFL states at $\nu=1$ and $\nu=1/3$ fillings. In all cases, we find the scaling of $S_2$ with subsystem size to be enhanced compared to the non-interacting case, and insensitive to the choice of geometry and projection to the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that, for CFL states, the variance of the particle number in a subsystem obeys area-law scaling with a universal subleading corner contribution, in stark contrast with free fermions. Our results establish the enhanced entanglement scaling and suppressed charge fluctuations as fingerprints of non-Fermi-liquid correlations in CFL states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as powerful observables for probing the fragmentation dynamics of high-energy collisions. We introduce the first numerical strategy for calculating energy correlators using the Hamiltonian lattice approach, providing access to the intriguing nonperturbative dynamics of these observables. Furthermore, motivated by rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we propose a quantum algorithm for calculating energy correlators in quantum field theories. This algorithm includes ground state preparation, the application of source, sink, energy flux and real-time evolution operators, and the Hadamard test. We validate our approach by applying it to the SU(2) pure gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on $3\times 3$ and $5\times 5$ honeycomb lattices with $j_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{2}$ at various couplings, utilizing both classical methods and the quantum algorithm, the latter tested using the IBM emulator for specific configurations. The results are consistent with the expected behavior of the strong coupling regime and motivate a more comprehensive study to probe the confinement dynamics across the weak and strong coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Building and aligning a 10-plane light converter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to manipulate the spatial structure of light is fundamental for a range of applications, from classical communication to quantum information processing. Multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) addresses the limitations of single-plane modulation by enabling full control over multiple spatial modes of light through a series of phase masks separated by free-space propagation. In this tutorial, we present a step-by-step guide for building and aligning a 10-plane programmable light converter using a single spatial light modulator (SLM) and standard optical components. Our method allows precise alignment, achieving single-pixel accuracy with a relatively simple setup. We hope that this guide will help other researchers to quickly adopt and adapt MPLC technology for their own experiments.</description>

      <title>Effects of non-integrability in a non-Hermitian time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time crystals are systems that spontaneously break time-translation symmetry, exhibiting repeating patterns in time. Recent work has shown that non-Hermitian Floquet systems can host a time crystalline phase with quasi-long-range order. In this work, we investigate the effect of introducing a non-integrable interaction term into this non-Hermitian time crystal model. Using a combination of numerical TEBD simulations, mean-field analysis, and perturbation theory, we find that the interaction term has two notable effects. First, it induces a shift in the phase diagram, moving the boundaries between different phases. Second, a sufficiently strong interaction induces an unexpected symmetry-breaking transition, which is not captured by the mean-field approach. Within average Hamiltonian theory, we trace this back to a ferromagnetic transition in the anisotropic non-Hermitian XXZ model. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between non-Hermitian dynamics and many-body interactions can lead to novel symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for any approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses induced by the complex driving frequencies. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are incompatible with the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work provides a platform for studying non-Hermitian physics and their novel response in quantum systems rigorously without relying on any approximations.</description>

      <title>The Birth of Quantum Mechanics: A Historical Study Through the Canonical Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the historical development of the theory of quantum mechanics between 1900 and 1927 by chronological examination of the foundational papers and ideas. Beginning with Planck's introduction of energy quantisation in blackbody radiation, we follow the emergence of Einstein's light quanta hypothesis, Bohr's atomic model, and the statistical implications of indistinguishable particles. Special emphasis is placed on the transition from the Old Quantum Theory to modern quantum mechanics, particularly through Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schr\"{o}dinger's wave mechanics. This study aims to provide a structured historical account, offering insights into the conceptual transformations that led to quantum mechanics while making the development accessible to physicists, historians of science, and advanced students interested in the origins of modern quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically-exact algorithm using few-body revealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quasi-stationary states in quantum mechanics using the exact WKB analysis as a non-perturbative framework. While previous works focus mainly on stable systems, we explore unstable states such as resonances. As a concrete example, we analyze the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, which exhibits barrier resonance. This model allows exact solutions, enabling a direct comparison with exact WKB predictions. We provide a simple analytic picture of resonance and demonstrate consistency between exact and WKB-based results, extending the applicability of exact WKB analysis to non-polynomial potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Atomic Josephson Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is reflected by specific patterns of density waves and phase excitations. We employ a classical-field dynamics method and benchmark our results against driven circuit dynamics. This work paves the way for tunable quantum amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing.</description>
