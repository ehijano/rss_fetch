      <title>PSR J1947-1120: A New Huntsman Millisecond Pulsar Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of PSR J1947-1120, a new huntsman millisecond pulsar with a red giant companion star in a 10.3 d orbit. This pulsar was found via optical, X-ray, and radio follow-up of the previously unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGL J1947.6-1121. PSR J1947-1120 is the second confirmed pulsar in the huntsman class and establishes this as a bona fide subclass of millisecond pulsar. We use MESA models to show that huntsman pulsars can be naturally explained as neutron star binaries whose secondaries are currently in the "red bump" region of the red giant branch, temporarily underfilling their Roche lobes and hence halting mass transfer. Huntsman pulsars offer a new view of the formation of typical millisecond pulsars, allowing novel constraints on the efficiency of mass transfer and recycling at an intermediate stage in the process.</description>

      <title>X-ray Dips and Polarization Angle Swings in GX 13+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the result from the April 2024 observation of the low-mass X-ray binary GX 13+1 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), together with NICER and Swift-XRT coordinated observations. Two light curve dips were observed; during them, the harder Comptonized spectral component was dominant and the polarization degree higher than in the softer, off-dip intervals. Through a joint analysis of the three IXPE observations, which also included the dip from the first observation, we demonstrate that the polarization properties varied in response to the intensity and spectral hardness changes associated with the dips. The polarization degree attained values up to ~4%. The polarization angle showed a swing of ~70{\deg} across the dip and off-dip states, comparable to the continuous rotation seen during the first IXPE observation. We discuss these results in the context of models for polarized emission from the accretion disk and the boundary/spreading layer on the neutron star surface. We also draw attention to the role that an extended accretion disk corona or disk wind can play in generating high polarization degrees and, possibly, swings of the polarization angle.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a likely Type II SN at $z$=3.6 with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient astronomy in the early, high-redshift (z&gt;3) Universe is an unexplored regime that offers the possibility of probing the first stars and the Epoch of Reionization. During Cycles 1 and 2 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program enabled one of the first searches for transients in deep images (~ $30$ AB mag) over a relatively wide area ($25$ arcmin$^2$). One transient, AT 2023adsv, was discovered with an F200W magnitude of $28.04$ AB mag, and subsequent JWST observations revealed that the transient is a likely supernova (SN) in a host with $z_{\rm spec}=3.613\pm0.001$, a host mass of log(M$_{*}$/M$_\odot$) = $8.41^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, and an inferred metallicity at the position of the SN of Z$_{*}$ = $0.3\pm0.1$ Z$_\odot$. At this redshift, the first detections in F115W and F150W show that AT 2023adsv had bright rest-frame ultraviolet flux at the time of discovery. The multi-band light curve of AT 2023adsv is best matched by a template of an SN IIP, with a peak absolute magnitude of $-18.3$ AB mag in the rest-frame $B$-band. We model AT 2023adsv's light curve and find a good match to a $20M_\odot$ red supergiant progenitor star with an explosion energy of $2.0\times 10^{51}$ ergs, likely higher than normally observed in the local Universe, but consistent with SNe IIP drawn from local, lower metallicity environments. AT 2023adsv is the most distant photometrically classified SN IIP yet discovered with a spectroscopic redshift measurement, and may represent a global shift in SNe IIP properties as a function of redshift. This discovery, and the ones sure to follow, demonstrate the continued need for facilities like JWST to build a statistical sample of core-collapse SNe to understand the evolution of their properties, and to constrain the poorly understood relationship between progenitor metallicity and massive star evolution.</description>

      <title>XRISM reveals low non-thermal pressure in the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present XRISM Resolve observations of the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029. We find that the line-of-sight bulk velocity of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the central 180 kpc is at rest with respect to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, with a 3-sigma upper limit of |v_bulk| &lt; 100 km/s. We robustly measure the field-integrated ICM velocity dispersion to be sigma_v = 169 +/- 10 km/s, obtaining similar results for both single-temperature and two-temperature plasma models to account for the cluster cool core. This result, if ascribed to isotropic turbulence, implies a subsonic ICM with Mach number M_3D ~ 0.21 and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 2%. The turbulent velocity is similar to what was measured in the core of the Perseus cluster by Hitomi, but here in a more massive cluster with an ICM temperature of 7 keV, the limit on non-thermal pressure fraction is even more stringent. Our result is consistent with expectations from simulations of relaxed clusters, but it is on the low end of the predicted distribution, indicating that Abell 2029 is an exceptionally relaxed cluster with no significant impacts from either a recent minor merger or AGN activity.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency study of sub-parsec jets with the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2017 observing campaign of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) delivered the first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images at the observing frequency of 230 GHz, leading to a number of unique studies on black holes and relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN). In total, eighteen sources were observed: the main science targets, Sgr A* and M87 along with various calibrators. We investigated the morphology of the sixteen AGN in the EHT 2017 data set, focusing on the properties of the VLBI cores: size, flux density, and brightness temperature. We studied their dependence on the observing frequency in order to compare it with the Blandford-K\"onigl (BK) jet model. We modeled the source structure of seven AGN in the EHT 2017 data set using linearly polarized circular Gaussian components and collected results for the other nine AGN from dedicated EHT publications, complemented by lower frequency data in the 2-86 GHz range. Then, we studied the dependences of the VLBI core flux density, size, and brightness temperature on the frequency measured in the AGN host frame. We compared the observations with the BK jet model and estimated the magnetic field strength dependence on the distance from the central black hole. Our results indicate a deviation from the standard BK model, particularly in the decrease of the brightness temperature with the observing frequency. Either bulk acceleration of the jet material, energy transfer from the magnetic field to the particles, or both are required to explain the observations.</description>

      <title>Space-based Ultra-High Energy Cosmic-Ray Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based experiments, either orbiting the Earth or from scientific balloon altitudes, measure high-energy cosmic rays by measuring from above the atmosphere the optical and radio signals generated by extensive air showers (EAS). These experiments are designed to have a large field-of-view (FoV) for observing EAS which translates to monitoring the atmosphere over a large, $\sim 10^6$ km$^2$ area on the ground. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E_{CR} &gt; ~\sim 1$ EeV) are measured by using the isotropic near-UV air fluorescence signal to finely sample the EAS development and to efficiently use the atmosphere as a vast calorimeter. At UHE, these immense EAS particle cascades have sufficient charged particle content to generate the relatively dim fluorescence light that propagates to the space-based instrument. Additionally, the beamed Cherenkov light and geomagnetic radio emission from EAS arrive with $&gt; ~\sim 10$ ns impulse and are measured at small angles away from the cosmic ray trajectories. In particular for optical Cherenkov measurements, the energy thresholds can be $&gt; ~\sim 1$ PeV, i.e. for very-high energy cosmic rays (VHECRs). ...
  In this chapter, the nature of observing the UHECR-induced shower development from orbiting and balloon-borne experiments is detailed, both for missions that have been flown and those currently in development. This will be accomplished by discussing experimental performance in terms of measuring the UHECR spectrum, UHECR nuclear composition, and UHECR arrival direction. The ability for these experiments to also perform VHECR and VHE and UHE cosmic neutrino measurements will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>An Exceptionally Powerful, Radiatively Driven Ultrafast Outflow in the Rapidly Accreting AGN REJ1034+396</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the analysis of ~1Ms of XMM-Newton observations of the rapidly accreting active galactic nucleus REJ1034+396. The 0.3-9 keV EPIC-pn spectra are well described by a model consisting of steep continuum emission from the corona accompanied by relativistically-blurred reflection from a highly ionized accretion disk. The source is known to exhibit strong excess soft X-ray emission, which we show is well represented by thermal disk photons Comptonized by a warm plasma spanning the inner accretion flow. Additionally, the EPIC-pn data provide compelling evidence ($\Delta C\sim60$ for 4 additional parameters) for the presence of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a line-of-sight velocity $v/c=0.307^{+0.001}_{-0.005}$, and an emission signature consistent with reflection of the corona from modestly ionized, outflowing gas. The simultaneous $0.5-2.5$\,keV RGS spectra show clear absorption lines. Modelling of these data confirms the presence of the UFO and constrains its equivalent hydrogen column density, log $N_\mathrm{H}/$(atom cm$^{-2}$) = $21.7^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$. The RGS data also reveal at least two warm absorber components with a modest outflow velocity ($1680^{+40}_{-50}$ km/s). The measured properties and time evolution of the UFO in REJ1034+396 suggest that it is formed from collisionally ionized plasma, launched from the disk surface and accelerated by radiation pressure. The high terminal velocity and substantial absorbing column density imply that the outflow carries sufficient momentum and energy to transform its environment, being capable of driving out essentially all dust and gas it interacts with along the line of sight, even if the AGN were initially surrounded by a Compton thick absorber.</description>

      <title>A new algorithm for detecting X-ray shots in Cyg X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short-term X-ray variability of Cyg X-1 can be interpreted as random occurrence of mini-flares known as the shots, whose physical nature is still unclear. We propose a new algorithm for shot identification in the X-ray light curve, based on baseline detection and template fitting. Compared with previous techniques, our algorithm allows us to detect shots with lower amplitudes and shorter time separations. With NICER observations, we find that, after correction for detection sensitivity, both the shot amplitude and recurrence rate are positively scaled with the mean count rate, while the recurrence rate has a much higher dependence on the count rate. These suggest that a higher mass accretion rate will drive more and slightly larger shots. We also find that the abrupt hardening near the shot peak found in previous studies is attributed to different shot profiles in different energy bands; there is no need to involve a rapid physical process to suddenly harden the emitting spectrum.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Narratives: Poetic Representations of Gamma-Ray Emission from FermiLAT via Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intersection of art and science offers novel ways to interpret and represent complex phenomena. This project explores the convergence of high-energy astrophysics, concrete poetry, and natural language processing (NLP) by proposing a Markov chain-based algorithm that generates poetic texts from gamma-ray emission maps of the universe. Gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, arise from violent astrophysical processes such as supernovae, pulsars, and black hole accretion, observable through instruments like the \textit{Fermi Large Area Telescope} (FermiLAT). These high-energy events are mapped and processed into matrices, treated as Markov chains, where each state's transition probability is determined by the intensity of gamma-ray sources in a region of interest.</description>

      <title>Expanding Molecular Shell and Possible {\gamma}-ray Source Associated with Supernova Remnant Kesteven 67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kesteven 67 (G18.8+0.3) using observations in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, HCO$^+$,and HCN lines and possible associated $\gamma$-ray emission using 16-yr Fermi-LAT observation. We find that the SNR is closely surrounded by a molecular belt in the southeastern boundary, with the both recessed in the band-like molecular gas structure along the Galactic plane. The asymmetric molecular line profiles are widely present in the surrounding gas around local-standard-of-rest velocity +20 km s$^{-1}$. The secondary components centered at $\sim$+16km s$^{-1}$ in the belt and $\sim$+26 km s$^{-1}$ in the northern clump can be ascribed to the motion of a wind-blown molecular shell. This explanation is supported by the position-velocity diagram along a line cutting across the remnant, which shows an arc-like pattern, suggesting an expanding gas structure. With the simulation of chemical effects of shock propagation, the abundance ratios $N$(HCO$^+$)/$N$($^{12}$CO) $\sim2.6\times 10^{-5}$--$3.6\times 10^{-4}$ obtained in the belt can be more naturally interpreted by the wind-driven bubble shock than by the SNR shock. The belt and northern clump are very likely to be parts of an incomplete molecular shell of bubble driven by O-type progenitor star's wind. The analysis of 0.2--500 GeV $\gamma$-ray emission uncovers a possible point source (`Source~A') about 6.5$\sigma$ located in the north of the SNR, which essentially corresponds to northern molecular clump. Our spectral fit of the emission indicates that a hadronic origin is favored by the measured Galactic number ratio between CR electrons and protons $\sim0.01$.</description>

      <title>Black hole-disc coevolution in the presence of magnetic fields: refining the Thorne limit with emission from within the plunging region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion of material onto a black hole modifies the properties of that hole owing to the capture of both matter and radiation. Adding matter to the hole through an accretion disc generally acts to increase the hole's spin parameter, while the capture of radiation generally provides a retarding torque. The balance between the torques provided by adding matter and radiation leads to a maximum spin parameter that can be obtained by a black hole which grows by accretion, known as the Thorne limit. In the simplest theory of thin disc accretion this Thorne limit has the value $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.998$. The purpose of this paper is to highlight that any modification to theories of accretion flows also modify this limiting value, and to compute precisely the modification arising from a particular extension of accretion theory: the inclusion of bright emission from within the plunging region which is sourced from the magnetohydrodynamic stresses ubiquitously observed in simulations. This extra emission further suppresses black hole spin-up and results in new, lower, limits on the final black hole spin. These limits depend on the details of the magnetic stresses acting within the plunging region, but typical values seen in simulations and observations would lower the limit to $a_{\bullet, {\rm lim}} \simeq 0.99$, a subtle but not negligible deviation.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Saddle-like GeV-TeV Spectrum of HESS 1809-193: Gamma-Rays Arising from Reverse-Shocked Pulsar Wind Nebula?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution of pulsar wind nebulae (PWN) could be expected to leave imprints in gamma-rays. We suggest that intriguing GeV-TeV spectral energy distribution (SED) of HESS J1809-193 and Fermi-LAT source J1810.3-1925e is very likely to be the gamma-ray signature of PWN J1809-193 in light of the scenario that the PWN was struck by the reverse shock of the parent supernova remnant. Based on evolutionary theory of PWNe, we consider that, when the PWN was disrupted during collision by the reverse shock, some very high-energy electrons escaped impulsively. The remaining electrons stayed in the relic PWN, which was displaced from the pulsar. The very high-energy part of the remaining electrons were depleted by the strong magnetic field was enhanced by the reverse shock compression in the reverberation stage, leaving the other part of them generating GeV emission. The particles injected from the pulsar after the disruption enter the relic PWN through the newly formed tunnel called the cocoon. The {\gamma}-ray emission from the escaped electrons can account for the TeV spectrum of component A of HESS J1809-193 or the TeV halo, while the electrons remaining after disruption can account for the GeV spectrum of J1810.3-1925e. Thus, combination of contributions from these two populations of electrons naturally reproduces the saddle-like SED of HESS 1809-193 and J1810.31925e from 5 GeV to 30 TeV, together with the spectral hardening around 100 GeV. We also show that the post-disruption injection of electrons can explain the spectrum of the relatively faint gamma-ray emission of component B of HESS J1809-193.</description>

      <title>SECRET: Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons depends sensitively on the history and spatial distribution of nearby sources. Given our limited observational handle on cosmic-ray sources, any model remains necessarily probabilistic. Previously, predictions were performed in a Monte Carlo fashion, summing the contributions from individual, simulated sources to generate samples from the statistical ensemble of possible electron spectra. Such simulations need to be re-run if the cosmic-ray transport parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficient, maximum energy) are changed, rendering any parameter study computationally expensive. In addition, a proper statistical analysis of observations and comparison with such probabilistic models requires the joint probability distribution of the full spectrum instead of only samples. Note that parametrising this joint distribution is rendered difficult by the non-Gaussian statistics of the cosmic-ray fluxes. Here, we employ machine learning to compute the joint probability distribution of cosmic-ray electron fluxes. Specifically, we employ masked autoregressive density estimation (MADE) for a representation of the high-dimensional joint probability distribution. In a first step, we train the network on a Monte Carlo simulation for a fixed set of transport parameters, thus significantly accelerating the generation of samples. In a second step, we extend this setup to SECRET (Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons), allowing to reliably interpolate over the space of transport parameters. We make the MADE and SECRET codes available at https://git.rwth-aachen.de/pmertsch/secret .</description>

      <title>Timing and spectral studies of the Be/X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 using Insight-HXMT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the high mass X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 during the 2021 type-II outburst based on the Insight-HXMT observations. Pulsations can be detected in the energy band of 1-150 keV. The pulse profile shows energy and luminosity dependence and variability. We observed transitions in the pulse profile shape during the rising and the decaying phase of the outburst. The pulse fraction exhibits an anti-correlation with luminosity and a non-monotonic energy dependence, with a possible dip near 30 keV during the outburst peak. The hardness-intensity diagrams (7-10 keV/4-7 keV) suggest state transitions during the early and late phases of the outburst. These transitions are consistent with the luminosity at which the pulse profile shape changes occur, revealing the source reaching the critical luminosity and transitioning between super-critical and sub-critical accretion regimes. We performed the average and phase-resolved spectral analysis, where the flux-resolved average spectra show a stable spectral evolution with luminosity. The phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals that the dependence of spectral parameters on the pulse phase varies with different luminosities.</description>

      <title>Thermal emission from bow shocks III: Variable diffuse X-ray emission from stellar-wind bow shocks driven by dynamical instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray emission from wind-driven bow shocks is both difficult to measure and predict, but may give important insights into the energy budget of the hot phase of the ISM by quantifying mixing at the interface between hot and warm gas phases. We investigate the effect of magnetic fields and numerical resolution on predicted X-ray emission and other observable properties of bow shocks, to study convergence properties and assess robustness of predicted observables from simulations. A suite of 2D and 3D HD and MHD simulations of bow shocks were run and analysed to generate synthetic emission maps and lightcurves in X-ray and infrared emission. Resolving the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability at the wind-ISM contact discontinuity is crucial for obtaining converged results and for predicting X-ray emission and the properties of the hot shocked wind. When sufficient spatial resolution is used, we measure time variation of X-ray emission of at least an order of magnitude on a timescale comparable to the advection timescale of the wake downstream from the bow shock. Good correspondence is found between 2D and 3D simulations with comparable resolution, and 3D simulations can achieve the required resolution with reasonable computing resources. Development of the KH instability is inhibited for shear flows parallel to the ISM magnetic field, compared with what is seen in the perpendicular direction, resulting in synthetic IR emission maps of bow shocks that are smooth when seen from one perspective but show strong distortions from another. Measuring the X-ray morphology and luminosity in bow shocks may be useful for constraining mixing and energy-transfer rates between hot and warm gas phases of the ISM. Dynamical instabilities at the wind-ISM interface are a crucial ingredient in determining the properties of the hot-gas phase in stellar bow-shocks, in particular to capture its time dependence.</description>

      <title>Ultraluminous X-ray sources in Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the formation, populations, and evolutionary paths of UltraLuminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) within Globular Clusters (GCs). ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters.
  Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones.
  The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of "escaper" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.</description>

      <title>QPEs as Lense-Thirring precession of super-Eddington flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a recently identified class of X-ray transient associated with tidal disruption events by supermassive black holes, and for which there are multiple possible explanations. In this paper we present a simple model which requires the black hole be spinning, be misaligned with the accretion flow (both conditions of which are almost certainly met) and that the accretion rate is a few times the Eddington limit. We speculate that the resulting Lense-Thirring torques force the disc and entrained outflows to precess, leading to increased X-ray flux when the wind-cone is oriented at lower inclinations to the observer. We test the range of parameters for which this model could explain the period and brightness of the QPE events discovered thus far, and make qualitative comparisons between the observed X-ray spectra and lightcurves to those extracted from GR-RMHD simulations. Overall, we find some areas of promising concordance, and identify challenges related to the details of current simulations.</description>

Abstract: The study of regular black holes and black hole mimickers as alternatives to standard black holes has recently gained significant attention, driven both by the need to extend general relativity to describe black hole interiors, and by recent advances in observational technologies. Despite considerable progress in this field, significant challenges remain in identifying and characterizing physically well-motivated classes of regular black holes and black hole mimickers. This report provides an overview of these challenges, and outlines some of the promising research directions -- as discussed during a week-long focus programme held at the Institute for Fundamental Physics of the Universe (IFPU) in Trieste from November 11th to 15th, 2024.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRCam simulations and observations of AGN ionization cones in cosmic noon galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extended narrow line region (NLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provides a valuable laboratory for exploring the relationship between AGN and their host galaxies, often appearing as an ''ionization cone'' that can extend out to the very edge of the galaxy. We use new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRCam imaging to study the morphologies and sizes of NLRs traced by [O III] at cosmic noon ($z\sim2-3$), measurements which were previously only well-studied at $z\sim0$ with IFU spectroscopy. To determine NIRCam's ability to probe the properties of the NLR in cosmic noon galaxies, we present simulated images of AGN at $z=2-3$ created with archival data cubes from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) of nine nearby ($z&lt;0.05$) AGN host galaxies with previously confirmed extended NLRs. Our simulated images show that NIRCam is able to resolve the morphologies of NLRs at $z=2-3$ with narrow- and medium-band observations. We then search for extended NLRs with NIRCam medium-band observations targeting the [O III] emission in twenty-seven previously identified AGN at $z=2.4-3.4$ in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field. We detect six galaxies in our observed sample with [O III] morphologies consistent with AGN ionization cones with characteristic NLR sizes of $1-2.5$ kpc. Thanks to our simulated data, we can predict the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming and instrument noise on the NLR size measurements at high redshift, which has the biasing effect of lowering the NLR size-AGN Luminosity trend that is observed at low redshift by a factor of $\sim 2$.</description>

      <title>Stellar X-ray variability and planetary evolution in the DS Tucanae system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of four Chandra observations of the 45 Myr old DS Tuc binary system. We observed X-ray variability of both stars on timescales from hours to months, including two strong X-ray flares from star A. The implied flaring rates are in agreement with past observations made with XMM-Newton, though these rates remain imprecise due to the relatively short total observation time. We find a clear, monotonic decline in the quiescent level of the star by a factor 1.8 across eight months, suggesting stellar variability that might be due to an activity cycle. If proven through future observations, DS Tuc A would be the youngest star for which a coronal activity cycle has been confirmed. The variation in our flux measurements across the four visits is also consistent with the scatter in empirical stellar X-ray relationships with Rossby number. In simulations of the possible evolution of the currently super-Neptune-sized planet DS Tuc Ab, we find a range of scenarios for the planet once it reaches a typical field age of 5 Gyr, from Neptune-size down to a completely stripped super-Earth. Improved constraints on the planet's mass in the future would significantly narrow these possibilities. We advocate for further Chandra observations to better constrain the variability of this important system.</description>

      <title>Mind the gaps: improved methods for the detection of periodicities in unevenly-sampled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of periodic signals in irregularly-sampled time series is a problem commonly encountered in astronomy. Traditional tools used for periodic searches, such as the periodogram, have poorly defined statistical properties under irregular sampling, which complicate inferring the underlying aperiodic variability used for hypothesis testing. The problem is exacerbated in the presence of stochastic variability, which can be easily mistaken by genuine periodic behaviour, particularly in the case of poorly sampled lightcurves. Here we present a method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) modelling for period searches and characterization, specifically developed to overcome these problems. We argue that in cases of irregularly-sampled time series, GPs offer an appealing alternative to traditional periodograms, because the known distribution of the data (correlated Gaussian) allows a well-defined likelihood to be constructed. We exploit this property and draw from existing statistical methods to perform traditional likelihood ratio tests for an additional, (quasi-)periodic component, using the aperiodic variability inferred from the data as the null hypothesis. Inferring the noise from the data allows the method to be fully generalizable, with the only condition that the data can be described as a Gaussian process. We demonstrate the method by applying it to a variety of objects showing varying levels of noise and data quality. Limitations of the method are discussed and a package implementing the proposed methodology is made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral characteristics of the Be/X-ray binary system, EXO 051910+3737.7, in which Be/X-ray systems are the largest sub-class of high-mass X-ray binaries. Spectroscopic observations are taken by the Thai National Telescope (TNT) with a Medium-RESolution spectrograph (MRES) instrument for seven nights spanning from 2020 to 2021. Our primary focus is directed towards the analysis of two Balmer lines, namely H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, given that Be stars typically exhibit emission features in at least one of these hydrogen Balmer lines during certain phases. Our observations reveal split Balmer emission lines throughout the entire duration of our monitoring. Double Gaussian profiles were employed for line fitting to characterize these lines. The presence of double peaks in the Balmer lines indicates the presence of asymmetries within the circumstellar disc. We then analyze V/R variations and the changes in H$\beta$ spectra. Our analysis of V/R variation which Violet (V) and Red (R) peak intensity components, revealed rapid fluctuations occurring within a single day, although determining the precise periodicity was constrained by instrumental limitations and the duration of observability. Furthermore, employing observed the wavelength differences ($\Delta\lambda$) in conjunction with typical Be star parameters allowed us to estimate the radius ($r_{\beta}$) of the H$\beta$ emitting envelope. The average value was calculated to be 2.585$r_*$, with a standard deviation of 0.050$r_*$.</description>

Abstract: We present our new model for the description of the very high energy Galactic gamma-ray emission based on a discrete injection of cosmic rays by individual sources. We investigate the morphology of the very high energy gamma-ray sky, the detectability of cosmic-ray sources and the clumpiness of the diffuse gamma-ray flux, assuming two different scenarios for cosmic-ray propagation. Namely, a standard isotropic and homogeneous diffusion process and an isotropic and inhomogeneous diffusion process. We notably formulate a possible explanation to the small number of hadronic PeVatrons recently detected by LHAASO. In the case of the inhomogeneous diffusion process, we constrain the number of hadronic PeVatrons to be small. Finally, we give an argument that may explain the discrepancy between the interstellar gas density distribution and the very high energy diffuse gamma-ray flux.</description>

      <title>Constraining a relativistic mean field model using neutron star mass-radius measurements II: Hyperonic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether measurements of the neutron star mass and radius or the tidal deformability can provide information about the presence of hyperons inside a neutron star. This is achieved by considering two inference models, with and without hyperons, based on a field-theoretical approach. While current observations do not distinguish between the two scenarios, we have shown that data simulating expected observations from future large area X-ray timing telescopes could provide some information through Bayes factors. Inference using simulated data generated from an EOS containing hyperons decisively favours the hyperonic model over the nucleonic model. However, a 2\% uncertainty in the mass and radius determination may not be sufficient to constrain the parameters of the model when only six neutron star mass-radius measurements are considered.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of the Si/O Interface in CCSN Explosions Using the Force Explosion Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova is a complex interplay between neutrino heating and cooling (including the effects of neutrino-driven convection), the gravitational potential, and the ram pressure of the infalling material. To analyze the post-bounce phase of a supernova, one can use the generalized Force Explosion Condition (FEC+), which succinctly formalizes the interplay among these four phenomena in an analytical condition, consistent with realistic simulations. In this paper, we use the FEC+ to study the post-bounce phase of 341 spherically symmetric simulations, where convection is included through a time-dependent mixing length approach. We find that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the expanding shock can significantly change the outcome of the supernova by driving the FEC+ above the explosion threshold. We systematically explore this by (i) artificially smoothing the pre-supernova density profile, and (ii) artificially varying the mixing length. In both cases, we find that large-enough density contrasts at the Si/O interface lead to successful shock revival only if the FEC+ is already close to the explosion threshold. Furthermore, we find that the accretion of the Si/O interface has a substantial effect on the critical condition for supernova explosions, contributing between 5\% and 15\%, depending on how pronounced the density contrast at the interface is. Earlier studies showed that convection affects the critical condition by 25--30\%, which demonstrates that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the shock can play a nearly comparable role in influencing shock dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict galactic cosmic-ray spectra on a one-day-ahead basis by leveraging historical solar activity data, overcoming limitations inherent in traditional transport models. By flexibly incorporating multiple solar parameters, such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The addition of historical cosmic-ray flux data significantly enhances prediction accuracy, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between past and future flux variations. Additionally, the model reliably predicts full cosmic-ray spectra for different particle species, enhancing its utility for comprehensive space weather forecasting. Our approach offers a scalable, data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based methods, ensuring robust daily and long-term forecasts. This work opens avenues for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory sensitivity to heavy Galactic Cosmic Rays and the shape of particle spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and the potential role of Supernova Remnants (SNRs) as cosmic-ray (CR) accelerators remain subjects of ongoing debate. To shed more light on this topic, we have studied the spectral shape of two SNRs, RX J1713.7-3946 and HAWC J2227+610, performing simulations for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). The previous multi-wavelength (MWL) analysis on these two sources showed an important hadronic contribution at high energies. The interaction of the GCRs accelerated by the SNRs with the medium around the accelerator leads to a process of pion decay (PD) that produces gamma-rays ($\gamma$-rays). These emissions, detectable by CTAO, offer an indirect means of pinpointing the CR source. Two scenarios have been considered: the contribution of heavy CRs and different cut-off sharpnesses ($\beta$) of the particle spectra. The simulations were performed by using different CR composition distributions (protons, CNO, Fe) and different sharpness values ranging from $\beta$=0.5 to $\beta$=1.5. The results show that, in the cases studied here, CTAO will increase the sensitivity to the spectral shape of $\gamma$-rays. This allows us to distinguish protons from heavy CRs and obtain information on $\beta$ values and therefore on different acceleration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Equation of State Independent Determination on the Radius of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ Neutron Star Using Mass-Radius Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional methods for determining the radius of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star ($R_{1.4}$) rely on specific equations of state (EOS) models that describe various types of dense nuclear matter. This dependence on EOS models can introduce substantial systematic uncertainties, which may exceed the measurement uncertainties when constraining $R_{1.4}$. In this study, we explore a novel approach to constraining $R_{1.4}$ using data from NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451 (J0030) and PSR J0437-4715 (J0437). However, this work presents a more data-driven analysis framework, substantially decreasing the need for EOS assumptions. By analyzing the Mass-Radius measurements of these two neutron stars, we infer $R_{1.4}$ using statistical methods based mostly on observational data. We examine various hotspot configurations for J0030, along with new J0437 observations, and their effects on the inferred radius. Our results are consistent with X-ray timing, gravitational wave, and nuclear physics constraints, while avoiding EOS-related biases. The same method has also been applied to a simulated mass-radius dataset, based on our knowledge of future X-ray telescopes, demonstrating the model's ability to recover the injected $R_{1.4}$ value in certain cases. This method provides a data-driven pathway for extracting neutron star properties and offers a new approach for future observational efforts in neutron star astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Redshift dependence of FRB host dispersion measures across cosmic epochs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the redshift dependence of (rest frame) host galaxy dispersion measures of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) by assuming it to vary as a simple power law ($\propto (1+z)^{\alpha}$). We simultaneously fit $\alpha$ as well as the host dispersion measure to the data of FRBs with known redshifts. We find that \color{black} $\alpha$ between 0 to 1 is preferred depending upon our modelling choices. Current data can constrain $|\alpha|\lesssim 2$ at a 68 percent confidence interval \color{black}. Such constraints have implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and can be used to inform galaxy and large scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Neutron Tagging Can Greatly Reduce Spallation Backgrounds in Super-Kamiokande</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-Kamiokande's spallation backgrounds - the delayed beta decays of nuclides following cosmic-ray muons - are nearly all produced by the small fraction of muons with hadronic showers. We show that these hadronic showers also produce neutrons; their captures can be detected with high efficiency due to the recent addition of dissolved gadolinium to Super-Kamiokande. We show that new cuts based on the neutron tagging of showers could reduce spallation backgrounds by a factor of at least four beyond present cuts. With further work, this could lead to a near-elimination of detector backgrounds above about 6 MeV, which would significantly improve the sensitivity of Super-Kamiokande. These findings heighten the importance of adding gadolinium to Hyper-Kamiokande, which is at a shallower depth. Further, a similar approach could be used in other detectors, for example, the JUNO liquid-scintillator detector, which is also at a shallower depth.</description>

      <title>Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis with Vela.jl: an overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Vela, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela provides an independent, efficient, and parallelized implementation of the full non-linear pulsar timing and noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela. One-time operations such as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris computations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing package. Its reliability is ensured via careful design utilizing Julia's type system, strict version control, and an exhaustive test suite. This paper describes the design and usage of Vela focusing on the narrowband paradigm.</description>
