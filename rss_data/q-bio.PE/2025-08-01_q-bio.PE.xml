      <title>Phylogenetic network models as graphical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The displayed tree phylogenetic network model is shown to sit as a natural submodel of the graphical model associated to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This representation allows to derive a number of results about the displayed tree model. In particular, the concept of a local modification to a DAG model is developed and applied to the displayed tree model. As an application, some nonidentifiability issues related to the displayed tree models are highlighted as they relate to reticulation edges and stacked reticulations in the networks. We also derive rank conditions on flattenings of probability tensors for the displayed tree model, generalizing classic results for phylogenetic tree models.</description>

      <title>Factors controlling protein evolvability, at the molecular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This piece serves two purposes. Firstly, it aims at elucidating the role of epistasis in shaping, at a molecular level, the evolutionary paths of proteins, as well as the extent to which these epistatic effects are the outcome of an as-yet-unidentified epistatic force. Second, it seeks to ascertain the extent to which the principle of least action will enable us to identify which of all potential trajectories has the highest evolutionary efficiency, as well as how variations in factors such as protein robustness and folding rates, resulting from the unavoidability of destabilizing mutations, might influence this critical evolutionary process. The initial findings suggest that protein evolution, at a molecular level, may be more predictable than previously thought, as epistasis and the principle of least action collectively impose constraints on evolutionary paths and trajectories, and consequently, on protein evolvability. Thus, this work should advance our understanding of the main molecular mechanisms that underlie the evolution of mutation-driven proteins and also provide grounds to answer a fundamental evolutionary question: how does Darwinian selection regard all potential trajectories available?</description>

      <title>Global, Regional, and National Burden of Chronic Kidney Disease Attributable to High Body Mass Index (BMI) among Individuals Aged 20-54 Years from 1990 to 2021: An Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background:Chronic kidney disease is one of the most prevalent non-communicable health issues globally, and high body mass index plays a significant role in the onset and progression of chronic kidney disease. Methods: Data on the disease burden attributable to high body mass index were retrieved from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study . The global cases, age-standardized mortality rate , and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years attributable to high body mass index were estimated based on age, sex, geographic location, and the Social-demographic Index (SDI). The estimated annual percentage change was calculated to quantify trends in ASMR and ASDR from 1990 to 2019. Decomposition and frontier analyses were conducted to understand the drivers behind changes in burden and to identify top-performing countries. Inequality analysis was performed to assess disparities in burden across different SDI levels. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model was used to predict the disease burden up to 2035.Results: In 2021, there were 4,643.41 global deaths and 2,514,227.16 DALYs attributable to high body mass index-related CKD, more than triple the figures from 1990. Additionally, from 1990 to 2021, the ASMR and ASDR accelerated, with EAPCs of 2.25 (95% CI: 2.13 to 2.37) and 1.98 (95% CI: 1.89 to 2.08), respectively, particularly among males, in High-income North America, and in Low-middle SDI regions. In terms of SDI, the Low-middle SDI region had the highest ASMR and ASDR related to CKD in 2021. Conclusion: From 1990 to 2021, there was a significant increase in global deaths and DALYs attributable to high high body mass index related CKD. As a major public health issue for CKD patients, high BMI urgently requires targeted measures to address it.</description>

      <title>Household scale Wolbachia release strategies for effective dengue control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into Aedes aegypti infested areas is a promising strategy for localised eradication of dengue infection. Ae aegypti mosquitoes favour urban environments as breeding habitats, so are often found in and around houses. Therefore, it is likely that they will infect members of the households that they reside around. Since population groupings within households are small, stochastic effects become important. Despite this, little work has been carried out to investigate the outcome of releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes at a household scale, either from an empirical and theoretical stand point. In previous work, we developed and analysed a stochastic (continuous time Markov chain) model for the invasion of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into a single household containing a population of wildtype mosquitoes. In the present study, we extend our framework to a connected community of households coupled by the movement of mosquitoes. We use numerical results obtained via Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm to investigate optimal strategies for the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes carried out at either the community or the household scale. We find that household scale releases can facilitate rapid and successful invasion of the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into the household population and then into the wider community. We further explore the impact of regular household scale releases of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes for a range of compositions for the release population, time intervals between releases and proportion of households participating in the releases. We find that a single release household can provide sufficient protection to the entire community of households if releases are carried out frequently for a number of years and a sufficient number of females are released on each occasion.</description>

      <title>Environment heterogeneity creates fast amplifiers of natural selection in graph-structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex spatial structure, with partially isolated subpopulations, and environment heterogeneity, such as gradients in nutrients, oxygen, and drugs, both shape the evolution of natural populations. We investigate the impact of environment heterogeneity on mutant fixation in spatially structured populations with demes on the nodes of a graph. When migrations between demes are frequent, we demonstrate that environment heterogeneity can amplify natural selection and simultaneously accelerate mutant fixation and extinction, thereby fostering the quick fixation of beneficial mutants. We evidence this effect in the star graph, more strongly in the line graph, and also in a more general class of graphs. We show that for amplification to occur, mutants must have a stronger fitness advantage in demes with stronger migration outflow. In circulation graphs, where migration inflow and outflow are equal in each deme, we find that environment heterogeneity has no impact in a first approximation, but increases the fixation probability of beneficial mutants to second order. When migrations between demes are rare, we show that environment heterogeneity can also foster amplification of selection, by allowing demes with sufficient mutant advantage to become refugia for mutants.</description>

      <title>The gene's eye-view of quantitative genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling the evolution of a continuous trait in a biological population is one of the oldest problems in evolutionary biology, which led to the birth of quantitative genetics. With the recent development of GWAS methods, it has become essential to link the evolution of the trait distribution to the underlying evolution of allelic frequencies at many loci, co-contributing to the trait value. The way most articles go about this is to make assumptions on the trait distribution, and use Wright's formula to model how the evolution of the trait translates on each individual locus. Here, we take a gene's eye-view of the system, starting from an explicit finite-loci model with selection, drift, recombination and mutation, in which the trait value is a direct product of the genome. We let the number of loci go to infinity under the assumption of strong recombination, and characterize the limit behavior of a given locus with a McKean-Vlasov SDE and the corresponding Fokker-Planck IPDE. In words, the selection on a typical locus depends on the mean behaviour of the other loci which can be approximated with the law of the focal locus. Results include the independence of two loci and explicit stationary distribution for allelic frequencies at a given locus (under some assumptions on the fitness function).</description>
