      <title>Femtoscopy with L\'evy sources at NA61/SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent decades of high-energy physics research, it was demonstrated that strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) is created in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Investigation and understanding of the properties of the hadronic matter are among the most important goals of the NA61/SHINE collaboration at CERN SPS. Mapping of the phase diagram is achieved by varying the collision energy (5 GeV $\sqrt{s_{NN}}&lt;17$ GeV) and by changing the collision system ($p$+$p$, $p$+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). Femtoscopic correlations reveal the space-time structure of the hadron emitting source.
  In this article, we report on the measurement of femtoscopic correlations in small to intermediate systems. Comparing the measurements to calculations based on symmetric L\'evy sources, we discuss the results on L\'evy source parameters as a function of average pair transverse mass. One of the physical parameters is of particular importance, the L\'evy exponent $\alpha$, which describes the shape of the source and may be related to the critical exponent $\eta$ in the proximity of the critical point. Therefore, measuring it may shed light on the location of the critical endpoint of the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Detailed study of the decay of $^{21}$Mg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beta-delayed proton and gamma emission in the decay of $^{21}$Mg has been measured at ISOLDE, CERN with the ISOLDE Decay Station (IDS) set-up. The existing decay scheme is updated, in particular what concerns proton transitions to excited states in $^{20}$Ne. Signatures of interference in several parts of the spectrum are used to settle spin and parity assignments to highly excited states in $^{21}$Na. The previously reported $\beta$p$\alpha$ branch is confirmed. A half-life of 120.5(4) ms is extracted for $^{21}$Mg. The revised decay scheme is employed to test mirror symmetry in the decay and to extract the beta strength distribution of $^{21}$Mg that is compared with theory.</description>

      <title>Proposal for PAC 52: Measurement of $\alpha_-$ for $\Lambda\rightarrow p\pi^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to measure the weak decay constant $\alpha_-$ for the decay $\Lambda\rightarrow p\pi^-$ using a both circularly and linearly polarized photon beam with the GlueX spectrometer in Hall D. The measurement will take advantage of the fact that a measurement with both linear and circular photon beam polarization results in an over-constrained set of amplitudes which can be fitted to data and used to extract $\alpha_-$ which will be left as a free parameter in the fit. We expect to determine $\alpha_-$ with statistical uncertainties comparable to existing measurements and independent systematic uncertainties. This measurement can be performed alongside GlueX-II running and requires no new hardware or new beam time. The measurement requires that a sufficient fraction of the electron beam polarization be longitudinal in the Hall D tagger.</description>

      <title>Data-driven analysis of the beauty hadron production in p+p collisions at the LHC with Bayesian unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy flavour production in proton-proton (pp) collisions provides insights into the fundamental properties of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Beauty hadron production measurements are widely performed through indirect approaches based on their inclusive decay modes. A Bayesian unfolding data-driven analysis of the ALICE and LHCb data was performed in this study, which recovers the full kinematic information of the beauty hadrons via different inclusive decay channels. The corresponding beauty hadron production cross sections obtained after the Bayesian unfolding are found to be consistent within their uncertainties. The weighted average open beauty production cross sections are presented as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, respectively. The $p_T$-integrated open beauty production $\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}y$ and the total $\mathrm{b}\rm\overline{b}$ cross section $\sigma_{\rm \mathrm{b}\rm\overline{b}}$ are also reported. The precision of these results significantly improves upon worldwide measurements, providing valuable validation and constraints on mechanisms of heavy flavour production in pp collisions at the LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Probing the structure of $X(3872)$ in photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the production of $X(3872)$ mesons in photon-induced nuclear reactions near the threshold within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for direct photon-nucleon $X(3872)$ production processes as well as five different scenarios for their internal structure. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $X(3872)$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold incident photon energies of 8--16 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ and for incident photon energy of 13 GeV as well as the A dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $X(3872)$ production from ${\gamma}A$ collisions at photon energies around 13 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $X(3872)$ meson internal structure. We show that the absolute and relative observables considered reveal distinct sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in a dedicated experiment at the CEBAF facility in the near-threshold energy range will allow us to get valuable information on the $X(3872)$ inner structure.</description>

      <title>Novel method for in-situ drift velocity measurement in large volume TPCs: the Geometry Reference Chamber of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for low maintenance, low ambiguity in-situ drift velocity monitoring in large volume Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). The method was developed and deployed for the 40m^3 TPC tracker system of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN, which has a one meter of drift length. The method relies on a low-cost multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) placed downstream of the TPCs to be monitored. The drift velocity is then determined by matching the reconstructed tracks in the TPC to the hits of the pertinent monitoring chamber, called Geometry Reference Chamber (GRC), which is then used as a differential length scale. An important design requirement on the GRC was minimal added complexity to the existing system, in particular, compatibility with Front-End Electronics (FEE) cards already used to read out the TPCs. Moreover, the GRC system was designed to operate both in large and small particle flux. The system is capable of monitoring the evolution of the in-situ drift velocity down to a one permil precision, with a few minutes of time sampling.</description>

      <title>The odd-even differences in stability peninsula for $106 \leqslant Z \leqslant 112$ region with the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictive power of the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with density functional PC-PK1 is demonstrated for superheavy region ($101 \leqslant Z \leqslant 120$) by comparing with available experimental and empirical mass data in the AME2020. The DRHBc theory predicts 93 bound nuclei beyond the drip line $N = 258$ in the region of $106 \leqslant Z \leqslant 112$, which form a stability peninsula. The odd-even differences between odd-$N$ and even-$N$ nuclei are remarkable in the stability peninsula; the number of bound odd-$N$ nuclei is less than that of bound even-$N$ nuclei, and the one-neutron separation energy of an odd-$N$ nucleus is smaller than those of its neighboring even-$N$ nuclei due to the blocking effect. The deformation effect is indispensable for the reentrant stability beyond the drip line by significantly affecting the structure of single-particle levels around the Fermi energy. \textbf{\textcolor{red}{The interplay between deformation and pairing effects affects the position where the odd-$N$ nucleus becomes bound in the stability peninsula.}} By examining the deformation effect at different orders, it is found that \textbf{\textcolor{red}{quadrupole deformation makes leading contribution to the appearance of stability peninsula and the effects of hexadecapole and hexacontatetrapole deformations are nonnegligible.</description>

      <title>Development of the strip LGAD detector with double-end readout for future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Low-Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) is a new silicon detector and holds wide application prospects in particle physics experiments due to its excellent timing resolution.
  The LGAD with a pixel size of 1.3 mm $\times$ 1.3 mm was used to construct a High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) in ATLAS experiments to solve the pile-up problem.
  Meanwhile, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) also proposes detectors using the LGAD. However, pixel LGAD exhibits higher readout electronics density and cost, which somewhat limits the application of LGADs. To decrease the readout electronics density, the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has designed strip LGADs with larger areas. These strip LGADs are all 19 mm in length but with different widths of 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.3 mm.
  This article provides a detailed introduction to the design parameters of these strip LGADs and tests their electrical characteristics, including leakage current, break-down voltage, depletion capacitance, etc.
  The timing resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the three strip LGAD sensors were investigated using a beta source test system.
  The position resolution parallel to the strip direction was tested and analyzed for the first time using a pico-second laser test system.
  Tests have demonstrated that the timing resolution of strip LGADs can reach about 37.5 ps, and position resolution parallel to the strip direction is better than 1 mm.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy Scaling Functions in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Insights into the `Ultra-Central Flow Puzzle' and Constraints on Transport Coefficients and Nuclear Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropy scaling functions derived from comprehensive measurements of transverse momentum- and centrality-dependent anisotropy coefficients $v_2(p_T,\text{cent})$ and $v_3(p_T,\text{cent})$ in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 and 2.76 TeV, and Xe+Xe collisions at 5.44 TeV at the LHC, offer new insights into the `ultra-central flow puzzle'. These functions integrate diverse measurements into a single curve, clarifying anisotropy attenuation throughout the entire $p_T$ and centrality range. They reveal the influence of initial-state eccentricities ($\varepsilon_{n}$), dimensionless size ($\mathbb{R}$), radial flow, viscous correction to the thermal distribution function ($\delta_f$), the medium's stopping power ($\hat{q}$), and specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s$) on the observed anisotropies. This analysis not only enhances understanding of transport coefficients but also provides crucial constraints on nuclear deformation.</description>

      <title>The Performance of AC-coupled Strip LGAD developed by IHEP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AC-coupled Strip LGAD (Strip AC-LGAD) is a novel LGAD design that diminishes the density of readout electronics through the use of strip electrodes, enabling the simultaneous measurement of time and spatial information. The Institute of High Energy Physics has designed a long Strip AC-LGAD prototype with a strip electrode length of 5.7 mm and pitches of 150 $\mu m$, 200 $\mu m$, and 250 $\mu m$. Spatial and timing resolutions of the long Strip AC-LGAD are studied by pico-second laser test and beta source tests. The laser test demonstrates that spatial resolution improves as the pitch size decreases, with an optimal resolution achieved at 8.3 $\mu$m. Furthermore, the Beta source test yields a timing resolution of 37.6 ps.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the underlying structure of axial-vector bottom-charm tetraquarks in the light of their magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic moment yields an excellent framework to explore the inner structure of particles determined by the quark-gluon dynamics of QCD, as it is the leading-order response of a bound system to a weak external magnetic field. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of possible axial-vector $T_{bc\bar u \bar u}$, $T_{bc\bar d \bar d}$, and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ tetraquarks are obtained with the help of light-cone QCD sum rules. For this purpose, we assume that these states are represented as a diquark-antidiquark picture with different structures and interpolating currents. The magnetic moment results derived using different diquark-antidiquark configurations differ substantially from each other. This can be translated into more than one tetraquark state with the same quantum number and quark content yet possessing different magnetic moments. From the numerical results obtained, we have concluded that the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ states can project their inner structure, which can be used for their quantum numbers and quark-gluon organization. The contribution of individual quarks to the magnetic moments is also analyzed for completeness. We hope that our predictions of the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ tetraquarks, together with the results of other theoretical investigations of the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of these interesting tetraquarks, may be valuable in the search for these states in future experiments and in unraveling the internal structure of these tetraquarks.</description>
