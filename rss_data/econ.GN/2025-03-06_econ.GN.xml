      <title>How manipulable are prediction markets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a large-scale field experiment to investigate the manipulability of prediction markets. The main experiment involves randomly shocking prices across 817 separate markets; we then collect hourly price data to examine whether the effects of these shocks persist over time. We find that prediction markets can be manipulated: the effects of our trades are visible even 60 days after they have occurred. However, as predicted by our model, the effects of the manipulations somewhat fade over time. Markets with more traders, greater trading volume, and an external source of probability estimates are harder to manipulate.</description>

      <title>Exchange Rate Sensitivity in Free Zone Trade: An Empirical Study of the Istanbul Ataturk Airport Free Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study as part of an ongoing research effort, empirically examines the relationship between foreign trade in the Istanbul Ataturk Airport Free Zone and exchange rate movements. Monthly data from 2003 to 2016 were analyzed through stationarity tests (Unit Root), followed by the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, Cointegration Analysis, and the Toda-Yamamoto Causality Test. The findings indicate that the exchange rate does not significantly affect imports and exports in the free zone. This result suggests that free zones, due to their structural characteristics and operational framework, may be relatively insulated from exchange rate fluctuations. The study contributes to the literature by providing a focused analysis of a specific free zone in Turkiye, highlighting the potential independence of free zone trade from exchange rate volatility.</description>

      <title>When Should we Expect Non-Decreasing Returns from Data in Prediction Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the change in the prediction accuracy of a response variable when the number of predictors increases, and all variables follow a multivariate normal distribution. Assuming that the correlations between variables are independently drawn, I show that adding variables leads to globally increasing returns to scale when the mean of the correlation distribution is zero. The speed of learning depends positively on the variance of the correlation distribution. I use simulations to study the more complex case of correlation distributions with a non-zero mean and find a pattern of decreasing returns followed by increasing returns to scale - as long as the variance of correlations is not degenerate, in which case globally decreasing returns emerge. I train a collaborative filtering algorithm using the MovieLens 1M dataset to analyze returns from adding variables in a more realistic setting and find globally increasing returns to scale across $2,000$ variables. The results suggest significant scale advantages from additional variables in prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal transmission expansion modestly reduces decarbonization costs of U.S. electricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar and wind power are cost-competitive with fossil fuels, yet their intermittent nature presents challenges. Significant temporal and geographic differences in land, wind, and solar resources suggest that long-distance transmission could be particularly beneficial. Using a detailed, open-source model, we analyze optimal transmission expansion jointly with storage, generation, and hourly operations across the three primary interconnects in the United States. Transmission expansion offers far more benefits in a high-renewable system than in a system with mostly conventional generation. Yet while an optimal nationwide plan would have more than triple current interregional transmission, transmission decreases the cost of a 100% clean system by only 7% compared to a plan that relies solely on current transmission. Expanding capacity only within existing interconnects can achieve most of these savings. Adjustments to energy storage and generation mix can leverage the current interregional transmission infrastructure to build a clean power system at a reasonable cost.</description>

      <title>Thermal Macroeconomics: An axiomatic theory of aggregate economic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An axiomatic approach to macroeconomics based on the mathematical structure of thermodynamics is presented. It deduces relations between aggregate properties of an economy, concerning quantities and flows of goods and money, prices and the value of money, without any recourse to microeconomic foundations about the preferences and actions of individual economic agents. The approach has three important payoffs. 1) it provides a new and solid foundation for aspects of standard macroeconomic theory such as the existence of market prices, the value of money, the meaning of inflation, the symmetry and negative-definiteness of the macro-Slutsky matrix, and the Le Chatelier-Samuelson principle, without relying on implausibly strong rationality assumptions over individual microeconomic agents. 2) the approach generates new results, including implications for money flow and trade when two or more economies are put in contact, in terms of new concepts such as economic entropy, economic temperature, goods' values and money capacity. Some of these are related to standard economic concepts (eg marginal utility of money, market prices). Yet our approach derives them at a purely macroeconomic level and gives them a meaning independent of usual restrictions. Others of the concepts, such as economic entropy and temperature, have no direct counterparts in standard economics, but they have important economic interpretations and implications, as aggregate utility and the inverse marginal aggregate utility of money, respectively. 3) this analysis promises to open up new frontiers in macroeconomics by building a bridge to ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. More broadly, we hope that the economic analogue of entropy (governing the possible transitions between states of economic systems) may prove to be as fruitful for the social sciences as entropy has been in the natural sciences.</description>

      <title>AI Governance through Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper argues that market governance mechanisms should be considered a key approach in the governance of artificial intelligence (AI), alongside traditional regulatory frameworks. While current governance approaches have predominantly focused on regulation, we contend that market-based mechanisms offer effective incentives for responsible AI development. We examine four emerging vectors of market governance: insurance, auditing, procurement, and due diligence, demonstrating how these mechanisms can affirm the relationship between AI risk and financial risk while addressing capital allocation inefficiencies. While we do not claim that market forces alone can adequately protect societal interests, we maintain that standardised AI disclosures and market mechanisms can create powerful incentives for safe and responsible AI development. This paper urges regulators, economists, and machine learning researchers to investigate and implement market-based approaches to AI governance.</description>
