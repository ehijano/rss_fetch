      <title>A First Quantitative Characterization of Colombian Night Sky Through All-Sky Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light pollution, a rapidly escalating anthropogenic phenomenon driven by the excessive and often inefficient use of artificial lighting, has profound implications for astronomy, ecology, and human health. This study presents the first comprehensive characterization of night sky quality in Colombia, focusing on sites of astronomical and ecological significance. The selected locations include the Astronomical Observatory of UTP, the Tatacoa Desert, the Bogot\'a Botanical Garden, and Cerro Guadalupe. Utilizing the Sky Quality Camera, we collected all-sky data to measure surface brightness and correlated color temperature of the night sky. Our findings reveal a significant loss of natural sky visibility in urban areas and demonstrate the detrimental effects of artificial lighting on critical astronomical sites such as La Tatacoa. This study provides a crucial foundation for future research and informs the development of public policies aimed at preserving the night sky.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Photons Emitted by High-Energy Charged Particles as Background in Single-Photon Resolving Image Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an advanced technique optimized for detecting photons generated by charged particles, leveraging Skipper-CCD sensors. By analyzing background sources and detection efficiencies, the technique achieves strong agreement between experimental results and Cherenkov-based simulations. It also provides a robust framework for investigating secondary photon production in environments with high fluxes of ionizing particles, such as those anticipated in space-based astronomical instruments. These secondary photons present a critical challenge as background noise for next-generation single-photon resolving imagers used to study faint celestial objects. Furthermore, the method exhibits significant potential for broader applications, including exploring photon generation in various substrate materials and examining their transport through multiple interfaces.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar infrared emission bands (AIBs). However, current spectral databases for AIB analysis face limitations because of the neglect of anharmonicity in vibrations and of temperature effects, which result from the high computational cost of traditional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic infrared (IR) spectra while accounting for temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We apply MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1\,704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its ability to handle large molecular systems. Our results suggest that MLMD can facilitate the creation of extensive molecular spectral databases, advancing AI-assisted analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly with upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Space UV polarimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several space missions are proposed or planned for the coming two decades dedicated or including mid- to high-resolution spectropolarimetry on a wide UV band. This includes the European instrument Pollux for the NASA HWO flagship mission, the NASA SMEX candidate Polstar, and the French nanosatellite demonstrator CASSTOR. We are developing UV polarimeters for these missions thanks to a R&amp;D program funded by CNES. For the mid- and near-UV, i.e. above 120 nm, birefringent material (MgF2) can be used to produce a polarimeter. This is the baseline for Polstar, CASSTOR, and the MUV and NUV channels of Pollux. Prototypes have been built and tested with excellent results, and further tests are ongoing to fully characterize them. For the FUV channel of Pollux however, it is not possible to use this technology and we have instead studied a design based on mirrors only. We will present the various missions and instruments, their technical challenges, as well as the R&amp;D work performed on UV polarimeters and the proposed design solutions.</description>

      <title>Probing circular polarization and magnetic field structure in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic field morphology of relativistic jets can be studied with circular polarization (CP). Recent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations coupled with radiative transfer calculations make strong predictions about the level (and morphology) of the jet's CP emission. These simulations show that the sign of CP and the electric vector position angle (EVPA) are both sensitive to the jet's magnetic field morphology within the radio core. We probe this theory by exploring if the jet's radio core EVPA orientation is consistent with the observed sign of the core CP in deep full-track polarimetric observations. We aim to probe the nature of linear polarization and CP in the innermost regions of jets from a small sample of nine blazars. This sample includes sources that have exhibited: (i) positive CP, (ii) negative CP, or (iii) positive &amp; negative CP simultaneously in the radio core region. Nine blazar sources were observed using the VLBA at both 15 GHz and 23 GHz. Our self-calibration relies on a physically based model applied in DoG-HiT resulting in more accurate gains. We consider compact Stokes V structures instead of assuming it to be zero, which is crucial given the significant non-zero CP fraction observed at long baselines. We observe robust, relatively high degrees of fractional circular polarization m_c=(0.32 +- 0.2)% at 15 GHz and m_c=(0.59 +-0.56)% at 23 GHz. We observe consistent polarized structure and EVPA orientation over time when comparing our analysis with archival MOJAVE data. Theoretical predictions indicate a clear favored toroidal magnetic field orientation within the extended jet emission of the reconstructed signal of the blazar 0149+218. The jet structures of 1127-145 and 0528+134, even in superresolution, exhibit characteristics aligned with helical or poloidal magnetic nature.</description>

      <title>COMetary dust TAIL Simulator (COMTAILS): A computer code to generate comet dust tail brightness images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We present the COMetary dust TAIL Simulator (COMTAILS), a numerical Monte Carlo code to generate images of dust tail brightness from comets and active asteroids in the Solar System. Aims. We describe a numerical code, available to interested users, capable of generating simulated images of dust tail brightness for comparison with observations, to retrieve key dust parameters including size distribution, ejection velocities, and dust loss rates. An optional stellar field can be included in the background allowing for the assessment of stellar extinction by the tail, which can be compared with observational data. Methods. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to obtain the simulated images. The orbital parameters of the targets and their helio-centric positions and velocities were obtained from the JPL Horizons on-line ephemeris system. Results. Earlier versions of this code have been used to characterize the dust environment of various targets. In this study we present recent examples that demonstrate its ability to fit observed images of the long-period comets C/2024 N3 (NEOWISE) and C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). The code is readily applicable to future targets that may be identified for the upcoming European Space Agency Comet Interceptor mission.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the static input size of neural networks in flare forecasting by using spatial pyramid pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial extension of active regions (ARs) of the Sun can vary from one case to the next. This is a problem when studying solar flares with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as they generally use input images of a fixed size. Different processes can be performed to retrieve a database with homogeneous-sized data, such as resizing. Unfortunately, key features can be lost or distorted during these processes. This can lead to a deterioration of the ability of CNNs to classify flares of different soft X-ray classes, especially those from ARs with complex structures. Our work aims to implement and test a CNN architecture that retains the full features of the original resolution of the input images. We compare the performance of two CNN architectures for solar flare prediction: the first is a traditional CNN with resized input whereas the other implements a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) layer without any input resizing. Both are trained on the Spaceweather HMI Active Region Patch line-of-sight magnetogram database. We also study two cases of binary classification. In the first case, our model distinguishes ARs producing flares in less than 24h of class greater or equal to C1.0 from ARs producing flares in more than 24h or never; in the second case, it distinguishes ARs producing flares in less than 24h of class greater or equal to M1.0 from the other ARs. Our models implementing an SPP layer outperform the traditional CNN models when predicting flares greater or equal to C1.0 within 24h. However, their performances degrade sharply along the other models studied in this paper, when trained to classify images greater or equal to M1.0 flares. The degradation in SPP models when classifying only images greater or equal to M1.0 flares as positive may be attributed to its success in identifying features that appear in ARs a few hours before the flare, independently of their soft X-ray class.</description>

      <title>Design of a low-thrust gravity-assisted rendezvous trajectory to Halley's comet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comets are the most pristine planetesimals left from the formation of the Solar System. They carry unique information on the materials and the physical processes which led to the presence of planets and moons. Many important questions about cometary physics, such as origin, constituents and mechanism of cometary activity, remain unanswered. The next perihelion of comet 1P/Halley, in 2061, is an excellent opportunity to revisit this object of outstanding scientific and cultural relevance. In 1986, during its latest approach to the Sun, several flyby targeted Halley's comet to observe its nucleus and shed light on its properties, origin, and evolution. However, due to its retrograde orbit and high ecliptic inclination, the quality of data was limited by the large relative velocity and short time spent by the spacecraft inside the coma of the comet. A rendezvous mission like ESA/Rosetta would overcome such limitations, but the trajectory design is extremely challenging due to the shortcomings of current propulsion technology. Given the considerable lead times of spacecraft development and the long duration of the interplanetary transfer required to reach the comet, it is imperative to start mission planning several decades in advance. This study presents a low-thrust rendezvous strategy to reach the comet before the phase of intense activity during the close approach to the Sun. The trajectory design combines a gravity-assist maneuver with electric propulsion arcs to maximize scientific payload mass while constraining transfer duration. A propulsive plane change maneuver would be prohibitive. To keep the propellant budget within reasonable limits, most of the plane change maneuver is achieved via either a Jupiter or a Saturn flyby. The interplanetary low-thrust gravity-assisted trajectory design strategy is described, followed by the presentation of multiple proof-of-concept solutions.</description>

      <title>Asteroid phase curves and phase coloring effect using the ATLAS survey data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determined phase curves for 301,272 asteroids in the orange filter and 280,953 in the cyan filter from the latest ATLAS Solar System Catalog V2 (SSCAT-2). Among them, 3,345 and 492 asteroids in the orange and cyan filters, respectively, have uncertainties below 15%. Our simple model, which considers only the apparition effect, showed good consistency with more sophisticated methods requiring much less computational time. Database cross-matching allowed us to analyze G1 and G2 distributions according to taxonomy. We conducted two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to investigate two distinct aspects: similarities in paired G1, G2 distributions across different taxa and wavelength dependency within the same taxa. When comparing different taxa, we couldn't reject the null hypothesis for 11% of the orange sample and 31% of the cyan sample, indicating more disparities in the orange filter. For wavelength dependency, paired distributions of G1, G2 (o) vs. G1, G2 (c) showed statistically significant differences across all complexes, except for the A class. Our analysis suggests that while phase coloring behaviors are observed without a clear preference for reddening or bluening at phase angles below 5 degrees, reddening predominates in the 10 - 30 degrees range. We also observed smaller uncertainties in G2 than in G1. Simulations showed that G2 is less sensitive to lack of data at small phase angles. This is related to the definition of the H,G1,G2 function, where G1 contributes more to the opposition effect and G2 the linear part of the phase curve. Our catalog-independent algorithms are adaptable to new data sets, including future LSST data.</description>

Abstract: CARMENES stands for Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical \'Echelle Spectrographs. CARMENES took six years from a concept to the start of operations, and a couple more years of initial data collection until the first science publication, but now is revolutionising our knowledge on exoplanets and their stars in our immediate vicinity. Here we describe what CARMENES is: (i) an ultra-stabilised two-channel spectrograph at an almost dedicated 3.5 m telescope in southern Spain that covers in high spectral resolution and without big gaps from 0.52 mum to 1.71 mum; (ii) a science project aimed at comprehensively searching for and studying planetary systems with nearby, bright, M-dwarf hosts, but that also investigates transiting planets around other stars; and (iii) the German-Spanish consortium that designed and built the instrument and that has operated it under guaranteed and legacy time observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling noise in gravitational-wave observatories is crucial for accurately inferring the properties of gravitational-wave sources. We introduce a transdimensional Bayesian approach to characterise the noise in ground-based gravitational-wave observatories using the Bayesian inference software $\texttt{Bilby}$. The algorithm models broadband noise with a combination of power laws; narrowband features with Lorentzians; and shapelets to capture any additional features in the data. We show that our noise model provides a significantly improved fit of the LIGO and Virgo noise amplitude spectral densities compared to currently available noise fits obtained with on-source data segments. We perform astrophysical inference on well-known events in the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog using our noise model and observe shifts of up to $7\%$ in the $90\%$ boundaries of credible intervals for some parameters. We discuss plans to deploy this framework systematically for gravitational-wave inference along with possible areas of improvement.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Convolutional Neural Network-Based Star Detection and Centroiding Method for CubeSat Star Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star trackers are one of the most accurate celestial sensors used for absolute attitude determination. The devices detect stars in captured images and accurately compute their projected centroids on an imaging focal plane with subpixel precision. Traditional algorithms for star detection and centroiding often rely on threshold adjustments for star pixel detection and pixel brightness weighting for centroid computation. However, challenges like high sensor noise and stray light can compromise algorithm performance. This article introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for star detection and centroiding, tailored to address the issues posed by noisy star tracker images in the presence of stray light and other artifacts. Trained using simulated star images overlayed with real sensor noise and stray light, the CNN produces both a binary segmentation map distinguishing star pixels from the background and a distance map indicating each pixel's proximity to the nearest star centroid. Leveraging this distance information alongside pixel coordinates transforms centroid calculations into a set of trilateration problems solvable via the least squares method. Our method employs efficient UNet variants for the underlying CNN architectures, and the variants' performances are evaluated. Comprehensive testing has been undertaken with synthetic image evaluations, hardware-in-the-loop assessments, and night sky tests. The tests consistently demonstrated that our method outperforms several existing algorithms in centroiding accuracy and exhibits superior resilience to high sensor noise and stray light interference. An additional benefit of our algorithms is that they can be executed in real-time on low-power edge AI processors.</description>

Abstract: We report the first result from a dark photon dark matter search in the mass range from ${78.62}$ to $83.95~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a dielectric haloscope prototype for MADMAX (Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion eXperiment). Putative dark photons would convert to observable photons within a stack consisting of three sapphire disks and a mirror. The emitted power of this system is received by an antenna and successively digitized using a low-noise receiver. No dark photon signal has been observed. Assuming unpolarized dark photon dark matter with a local density of $\rho_{\chi}=0.3~\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ we exclude a dark photon to photon mixing parameter $\chi &gt; 2.7 \times 10^{-12}$ over the full mass range and $\chi &gt; 1.1 \times 10^{-13}$ at a mass of $80.57~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a 95\% confidence level. This is the first physics result from a MADMAX prototype and exceeds previous constraints on $\chi$ in this mass range by up to almost three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: cosmological parameters and the structure growth anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10609</link>

Abstract: We explore full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors, which is the simplest approach to galaxy clustering data analysis that combines effective field theory (EFT) on large scales and numerical simulations on small scales. The core ingredient of our approach is the prior density of EFT parameters which we extract from a suite of 10500 galaxy simulations based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. We measure the EFT parameters with the field-level forward model, which enables us to cancel cosmic variance. On the theory side, we develop a new efficient approach to calculate field-level transfer functions using time-sliced perturbation theory and the logarithmic fast Fourier transform. We find that the cosmology dependence of EFT parameters of galaxies is approximately degenerate with the HOD parameters, and hence it can be ignored for the purpose of prior generation. We use neural density estimation to model the measured distribution of EFT parameters. Our distribution model is then used as a prior in a reanalysis of the BOSS full-shape galaxy power spectrum data. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find significant ($\approx 30\%$ and $\approx 60\%$) improvements for the matter density fraction and the mass fluctuation amplitude, which are constrained to $\Omega_{m}= 0.315 \pm 0.010$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.671 \pm 0.027$. The value of the Hubble constant does not change, $H_0= 68.7\pm 1.1$~km/s/Mpc. This reaffirms earlier reports of the structure growth tension from the BOSS data. Finally, we use the measured EFT parameters to constrain the galaxy-dark matter connection.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Transit Candidate Identification in TESS Full-Frame Images via a Transformer-Based Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals. Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series, without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122 multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius &gt; 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.</description>
