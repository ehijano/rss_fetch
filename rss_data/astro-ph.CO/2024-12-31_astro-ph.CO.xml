      <title>Spectroscopic and X-ray Modeling of the Strong Lensing Galaxy Cluster MACS J0138.0-2155</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the total mass and galactic substructure in the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS J0138.0-2155 using a combination of Chandra X-ray data, Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectroscopy, and Hubble Space Telescope imaging. MACS J0138.0-2155 lenses a source galaxy at z=1.95 which hosts two strongly lensed supernovae, Requiem and Encore. We find MACS J0138.0-2155 to have an X-ray temperature of 6.7 +/- 0.4 keV and a velocity dispersion of cluster member galaxies of 718^{+132}_{-182} km/s, which indicate a cluster mass of ~5 x 10^{14} solar masses. The round morphology of the X-ray emission indicates that this cluster is relaxed with an ellipticity within the lensing region of e=0.12 +/- 0.03. Using 18 of the brightest, non-blended, quiescent galaxies, we fit the cluster specific Faber-Jackson relation, including a set of 81 variations in the analysis choices to estimate the systematic uncertainties in our results. We find a slope of alpha = 0.26 +/- 0.06 (stat.) +/- 0.03 (sys.) with an intrinsic scatter of 31^{+8}_{-6} (stat.) +/- 4 (sys.) km/s at a reference velocity dispersion of ~220 km/s. We also report on significant galaxies along the line-of-sight potentially impacting the lens modeling, including a massive galaxy with stellar velocity dispersion of 291 +/- 3 km/s$ which lies close in projection to the central cluster galaxy. This galaxy is part of a small group at a slightly higher redshift than the cluster.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a generalized equation of state model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of a generalized total equation of state (EoS) model by constraining its parameters using observational datasets to effectively characterize the universe's expansion history and its dynamic properties. We introduce three parameters: $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $n$ to capture the EoS behavior across different evolutionary phases. Our analysis indicates that at high redshifts ($z \gg 1$), the EoS approaches a matter- or radiation-dominated regime, transitioning to a dark energy-dominated phase as $z \to -1$, where it tends towards a constant value $\alpha$. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we analyze a combined dataset that includes 31 data points from $H(z)$ and 1701 data points from the Pantheon+ dataset. The results reveal a smooth transition from deceleration to acceleration in the universe's expansion, with current EoS values suggesting quintessence-like behavior. The model aligns with observations and indicates that dark energy is dynamically evolving rather than acting as a cosmological constant. Furthermore, energy conditions and stability analyses highlight the nature and future of dark energy. This parametrized EoS model thus offers a robust framework for understanding the complexities of dark energy and the evolution of the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Forecasts of effects of beam systematics and deprojection on the third generation ground-based CMB experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background experiments are susceptible to various instrumental errors, especially for $B$-mode measurements. The difference between the response of two polarized detectors, referred to as the ``beam mismatch'', would induce a $T\rightarrow P$ leakage when differencing the detector pair to cancel the unpolarized signal. In this work, we apply the deprojection technique on the time-ordered mock data to mitigate the systematic contamination caused by beam mismatches, by assuming the third generation ground-based CMB experiment (S3). Our results show that the deprojection could effectively recover the input power spectra. We adopt the NILC and cILC methods to reconstruct the foreground-cleaned $TEB$ maps, and evaluate the level of residual systematic errors after the foreground cleaning pipeline by comparing the power spectra between the systematics-added data after deprojection and the systematics-free data. The results demonstrate that the residual beam systematics cleaned by deprojection would not bias the CMB measurements of $T$, $E$, and $B$ modes, as well as the CMB lensing reconstruction and the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio under the S3 sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the equivalence between dark energy and radiation using gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differently from the equivalence time between either matter and radiation or dark energy and matter, the equivalence between dark energy and radiation occurs between two subdominant fluids, since it takes place in the matter dominated epoch. However, dark energy--radiation equivalence may correspond to a \emph{cosmographic bound} since it strongly depends on how dark energy evolves. Accordingly, a possible model-independent bound on this time would give hints on how dark energy evolves in time. In this respect, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may be used, in fact, as tracers to obtain cosmic constraints on this equivalence. Consequently, based on observed GR data from the $E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation, we here go beyond by simulating additional GRB data points and investigating two distinct equivalence epochs: 1) dark energy--radiation, and 2) dark energy--radiation with matter. We thus extract constraints on the corresponding two redshifts adopting Monte Carlo Markov chain simulations by means of two methods: the first performing the GRB calibration and the cosmological fit steps independently, and the second performing these steps simultaneously by resorting a hierarchical Bayesian regression. To keep the analysis model-independent, we consider a generic dark energy model, with the unique constraint to reduce to the $\Lambda$CDM at $z=0$. Our findings are thus compared to theoretical predictions, indicating that the $\Lambda$CDM model is statistically favored to predict such an equivalence time, though a slow evolution with time cannot be fully excluded. Finally, we critically re-examine the Hubble constant tension in view of our outcomes.</description>

      <title>Cosmological stimulated emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the analogy between graviton emission in a thermal radiation environment and the laser mechanism, where photons of the same momentum and polarization are amplified. Using interaction picture perturbation theory, we analyze the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in a squeezed vacuum state, describing the inflationary graviton state. During the radiation-dominated era of the early universe, we find secular growth in the graviton number, leading to the breakdown of perturbative analysis within approximately ten Hubble times after reheating. We also explore analogous effects in a Minkowski background. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors immersed in a radiation environment at temperatures of $O(10)$ GeV. In this scenario, graviton numbers at $O(100)$ Hz could be enhanced, suggesting a mechanism to amplify gravitational wave signals. While this setup is beyond current experimental capabilities, it points to potential advancements in gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the interaction strength in the model of interacting dynamical dark energy with linear and non-linear interacting terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work the observational constraints on interaction coupling parameter between dynamical dark energy and cold dark matter were obtained using CMB, BAO and SN Ia data. The dark energy in considered models is dynamical and evolution of its equation of state parameter depends on dark coupling and internal properties of the dark energy. Such model is believed to be more physically consistent than models of interacting dark energy considered in previous works. Constraints were made for three types of interaction. The first two are the types which are often considered in other works on interacting dark energy. The third type has the non-linear dependence on densities of dark components and is studied for the first time. Observational constraints on Hubble constant $H_{0}$ for the first two models are in strong disagreement with so called local measurements of $H_{0}$. And the third model is in better agreement with local measurements than $\Lambda$CDM model. Also for the last non-linear model existence of non-zero interaction was found at greater than $1\sigma$ significance level.</description>

      <title>Mergers of Binary Primordial Black Holes in Evolving Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of a dark matter halo around pair of primordial black holes on their orbit evolution and the black hole merger rate is considered. Because of the nonspherical (nonradial) contraction of DM shells, each shell upon the first contraction passes through the halo center in the direction of the radius vector corresponding to zero angular momentum. Since the shell contraction is a continuous process, at each instant of time there is a nonzero dark matter density at the halo center. This density is determined by the influence of the tidal gravitational forces from inflationary density perturbations and from other primordial black holes. The scattering of dark matter particles by a pair of black holes leads to a loss of the energy of its orbital motion and to an accelerated pair merger. In the case of primordial black holes with masses $\sim30M_\odot$, the black hole merger rate in the presence of a dark matter halo is several times higher than that without such a halo.</description>

      <title>Recovering 21cm global signal from 21cm power spectrum with artificial neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method to recover the 21cm global signal from the 21cm power spectrum using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The 21cm global signal is crucial for understanding cosmic evolution from the Dark Ages through the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). While interferometers like LOFAR, MWA, HERA, and SKA focus on detecting the 21cm power spectrum, single-dish experiments such as EDGES target the global signal. Our method utilizes ANNs to establish a connection between these two observables, providing a means to cross-validate independent 21cm line observations. This capability is significant as it allows different observational approaches to verify each other's results, ensuring greater reliability in 21cm cosmology. We demonstrate that our ANN-based approach can accurately recover the 21cm global signal across a wide redshift range (z=7.5-35) from simulated data, even when realistic thermal noise levels, such as those expected from SKA-1, are considered. This cross-validation process strengthens the robustness of 21cm signal analysis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmic strings for pedestrians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings represent an attractive source of gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. However, in contrast to other primordial GW sources whose signal may be modeled by simple analytic expressions, computing the GW signal from cosmic strings requires the numerical evaluation of complicated integral and sum expressions, which can become computationally costly in large parameter scans. This shortcoming motivates us to rederive the GW signal from a network of local stable cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto approximation and based on the velocity-dependent one-scale model from a "pedestrian" perspective. That is, we derive purely analytical expressions for the total GW spectrum, which remain exact wherever possible and whose error can be tracked and reduced in a controlled way in crucial situations in which we are forced to introduce approximations. In this way, we obtain powerful formulas that, unlike existing results in the literature, are valid across the entire frequency spectrum and across the entire conceivable range of cosmic-string tensions. We provide an in-depth discussion of the GW spectra thus obtained, including their characteristic break frequencies and approximate power-law behaviors, comment on the effect of changes in the effective number of degrees of freedom during radiation domination, and conclude with a concise summary of our main formulas that can readily be used in future studies.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as background and signal in Migdal search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionization or excitation resulting from the delayed response of the electron cloud to nuclear recoil is known as the Migdal effect. Dark matter searches utilizing this process set the most stringent bounds on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section over a large region of the sub-GeV dark matter parameter space, underscoring its significance in dark matter detection. In this paper, we quantify the regions of dark matter parameter space that are challenging to probe via the Migdal effect due to the presence of dominant solar neutrino backgrounds for both liquid noble and semiconductor targets. Our findings reveal that there is no hard floor in the dark matter parameter space. Instead, we map the so called neutrino fog. In mapping the neutrino fog, we identify the importance of incorporating the Migdal effect induced by neutrinos, as well as neutrino-electron scattering and dominant coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, particularly for semiconductor targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a large portion of the relic density allowed parameter space lies within the neutrino fog. Finally, we estimate the exposure required to detect neutrino induced Migdal events in direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Cosmohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing challenge to find a geometric object underlying the cosmological wavefunction for Tr($\phi^3$) theory, generalizing associahedra and surfacehedra for scattering amplitudes. In this note we describe a new class of polytopes -- "cosmohedra" -- that provide a natural solution to this problem. Cosmohedra are intimately related to associahedra, obtained by "blowing up" faces of the associahedron in a simple way, and we provide an explicit realization in terms of facet inequalities that further "shave" the facet inequalities of the associahedron. We also discuss a novel way for computing the wavefunction from cosmohedron geometry that extends the usual connection with polytope canonical forms. We illustrate cosmohedra with examples at tree-level and one loop; the close connection to surfacehedra suggests the generalization to all loop orders. We also briefly describe "cosmological correlahedra" for full correlators. We speculate on how the existence of cosmohedra might suggest a "stringy" formulation for the cosmological wavefunction/correlators, generalizing the way in which the Minkowski sum decomposition of associahedra naturally extend particle to string amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Disentangling axion-like particle couplings to nucleons via a delayed signal in Super-Kamiokande from a future supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that, if axion-like particles (ALPs) from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) couple to protons, they would produce very characteristic signatures in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors through their scattering off free protons via $a \, p \rightarrow p \, \gamma$ interactions. Specifically, sub-MeV ALPs would generate photons with energies $\sim 30$ MeV, which could be observed by Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande as a delayed signal after a future detection of SN neutrinos. We apply this to a hypothetical neighbouring SN (at a maximum distance of 100 kpc) and demonstrate that the region in the parameter space with ALP masses between $10^{-4}$ MeV and $1$ MeV and ALP-proton couplings in the range $3 \times 10^{-6}-4 \times 10^{-5}$ could be probed. We argue that this new signature, combined with the one expected at $\sim 7$ MeV from oxygen de-excitation, would allow us to disentangle ALP-neutron and ALP-proton couplings.</description>

      <title>A new constraint on galaxy-halo connections of [O II] emitters via HOD modelling with angular clustering and luminosity functions from the Subaru HSC survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing a robust connection model between emission-line galaxies (ELGs) and their host dark haloes is of paramount importance in anticipation of upcoming redshift surveys. In this paper, we propose a novel halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework that incorporates galaxy luminosity, a key observable reflecting ELG star-formation activity, into the galaxy occupation model. This innovation enables prediction of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) and facilitates joint analyses using both angular correlation functions (ACFs) and LFs. Using physical information from luminosity, our model provides more robust constraints on the ELG-halo connection compared to methods relying solely on ACF and number density constraints. Our model was applied to [O II]-emitting galaxies observed at two redshift slices at $z=1.193$ and $1.471$ from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam PDR2. Our model effectively reproduces observed ACFs and LFs observed in both redshift slices. Compared to the established \citeauthor{geach12} HOD model, our approach offers a more nuanced depiction of ELG occupation across halo mass ranges, suggesting a more realistic representation of ELG environments. Our findings suggest that ELGs at $z\sim1.4$ may evolve into Milky-Way-like galaxies, highlighting their role as potential building blocks in galaxy formation scenarios. By incorporating the LF as a constraint linking galaxy luminosity to halo properties, our HOD model provides a more precise understanding of ELG-host halo relationships. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the generation of high-quality ELG mock catalogues of for future surveys. As the LF is a fundamental observable, our framework is potentially applicable to diverse galaxy populations, offering a versatile tool for analysing data from next-generation galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Kinetic coupled tachyon: A dynamical system analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and examine a kinetically coupled tachyon dark energy model, where a tachyon scalar field interacts with the matter sector. More specifically, we deduce this cosmological setting from a generalised interacting dark energy model that allows for the kinetic term of the scalar field to couple to the matter species a priori in the action. A thorough dynamical system analysis and its cosmological implications unveil the appearance of a scaling solution which is also an attractor of the system, thanks to a novel critical point, with a period of accelerated expansion thereafter. This new solution, not present in the uncoupled case, has the enticing consequence of alleviating the coincidence problem.</description>

      <title>Refining lower bounds on sterile neutrino dark matter mass from estimates of phase space densities in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are recognized as being highly dominated by Dark Matter (DM), making them excellent targets for testing DM models through astrophysical observations. One effective method involves estimating the coarse-grained phase-space density (PSD) of the galactic DM component. By comparing this PSD with that of DM particles produced in the early Universe, it is possible to establish lower bounds on the DM particle mass. These constraints are particularly relevant for models of warm DM, such as those involving sterile neutrinos. Utilizing the GravSphere code, we obtain a fit of the DM PSD based on the latest reliable stellar dynamics data for twenty of the darkest dSphs, refining earlier lower bounds on sterile neutrino masses in non-resonant production scenarios. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach involving the Excess Mass Function (EMF), which yields even tighter constraints. Specifically, using the maximum PSD, we derive a lower bound of $m&gt;1.02$ keV at 95% confidence level, while the EMF method provides a stronger limit of $m&gt;1.98$ keV at 95% CL. Both methods are versatile and can be extended to more complex DM production mechanisms in the early Universe. For the first time, we also constrain parameters of models involving non-standard cosmologies during the epoch of neutrino production. Our analysis yields $m&gt;2.54$ keV for models with kination domination and $m&gt;4.71$ keV for scenarios with extremely low reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>Lower Limits on Scalar Ultralight Dark Matter from Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillations of scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) at its Compton frequency would couple to fundamental constants to coherently drive the length of nearby Fabry-Perot cavities. Resulting differences in the length of two cavities are searched for in the spectrum of the beat note between lasers traversing the cavities. The new direct ULDM bounds set near 5 kHz and between 20 and 90 kHz are one to two orders of magnitude lower for two model ULDM distributions -- a standard galactic halo, and a relaxion star bound to Earth. Laser filtering and mechanical isolation are critical.</description>

      <title>The Advantage of Early Detection and Localization from Eccentricity-Induced Higher Harmonic Modes in Second-Generation Ground-Based Detector Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection and localization of gravitational waves (GWs) are crucial for identifying and capturing their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, playing a significant role in multi-messenger astronomy. For second-generation (2G) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, the typical duration of GW signals ranges from $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ seconds to several tens of seconds due to their optimal sensitivities only at higher frequencies. This limited duration is insufficient to provide adequate early warning and localization for potential GWs and their associated EM counterparts. In this paper, we investigate whether eccentricity-induced higher harmonic modes, which enter the detector band much earlier than the dominant mode, can aid early detection and localization of GW sources using the 2G ground-based detector network. We select two typical events, a GW170817-like BNS and a GW150914-like BBH, as illustrative examples. For a GW170817-like BNS, we find that the eccentric case with $e_0=0.4$ at 10 Hz can achieve an SNR of 4 and the threshold SNR of 8 approximately 12 minutes and 5 minutes before merger, representing 4.5- and 1.5-minute improvements in time-to-merger compared to the circular case, respectively. Additionally, with $e_0=0.4$, it can achieve a localization of $1000 \, (100)\, \rm deg^2$ at 5 (1) minutes before the merger, reflecting improvements of 2 minutes (15 seconds) compared to the circular case. For a typical GW150914-like BBH, due to the much shorter signal duration, the time-to-merger gained from higher modes for achieving the same SNR and localization is limited to $\mathcal{O}(0.1)-\mathcal{O}(1)$ seconds. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of eccentricity-induced higher harmonic modes in improving early warning and localization of GW and EM counterparts, particularly for BNS systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Long-Range Forces Between Neutrinos with Cosmic Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the consequences of new long-range forces between neutrinos on cosmic scales. If these forces are a few orders of magnitude stronger than gravity, they can induce perturbation instability in the non-relativistic cosmic neutrino background in the late time universe. As a result, the cosmic neutrino background may form nonlinear bound states instead of free-streaming. The implications of the formation of nonlinear neutrino bound states include enhancing matter perturbations and triggering star formation. Based on existing measurements of the matter power spectrum and reionization history, we place new constraints on long-range forces between neutrinos with ranges lying in $1 \text{ kpc}\lesssim m_\phi^{-1} \lesssim 10 \text{ Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity using cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the late-time accelerating Universe and the formation of large-scale structures within the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity framework, specifically using the $f(Q)$-gravity model, in light of recent cosmological data. After reviewing the background history of the Universe, and the linear cosmological perturbations, we consider the toy model $F(Q) = \alpha\sqrt{Q}+\beta$ ( where $Q$ represents nonmetricity, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model parameters) for further analysis. To evaluate the cosmological viability of this model, we utilize 57 Observational Hubble Data (OHD) points, 1048 supernovae distance modulus measurements (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate data points (f-data), and 30 redshift-space distortions (f$\sigma_8$) datasets. Through a detailed statistical analysis, the comparison between our model and $\Lambda$CDM has been conducted after we compute the best-fit values through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Based on the results, we obtain the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 69.20^{+4.40}_{{-}2.10}$ and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum normalization $\sigma_8 = 0.827^{+0.03}_{{-}0.01}$. These values suggest that our model holds significant promise in addressing the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Searches for Power-Law Warped Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extra dimensions with a bulk dilaton field can be power-law warped, unlike the exponential warping in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We show that this mildly warped extra dimension can address the hierarchy problem with a novel Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum characterized by lighter feebly coupled KK modes compared to the KK modes in the RS model. We investigate the prospects of searching for signatures of such KK modes at current and future colliders, such as the LHC, CLIC, and FCC-ee using visible decays of KK gravitons. We also update the current bounds and projected limits for the RS model and the linear dilaton (LD) model. Furthermore, we explore the long-lived regime of KK gravitons at Belle II, beam dump experiments, e.g., FASER2, MATHUSLA, and SHiP, as well as constraints from astrophysical and cosmological observations. We find that combining both kinds of searches will enable comprehensive coverage of the model parameter space relevant to the electroweak hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Signatures of Neutrino Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by the seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In this work, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos. After inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field which act as the source of curvature perturbations. We demonstrate that this modulation produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures, which can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Gravitational EFT for dissipative open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity, in light of recent developments on the EFT of dissipative hydrodynamics (HydroEFT). Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. A key aspect of dynamical gravity is that gravity couples to all degrees of freedom universally, hence the EFT has to take into account the energy-momentum tensor of the environment to which the energy escapes from the dissipative system of interest. We incorporate this effect by modeling the environment based on HydroEFT, assuming validity of the derivative expansion of the environment sector. For illustration, we apply our EFT recipe to a dissipative scalar field coupled to dynamical gravity that can be used, e.g., for dissipative inflation. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing Gravitational Dark Matter with Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM) is compelling, yet its nature remains elusive. A particularly interesting and minimal scenario involves DM with pure gravitational interactions. In the early Universe, such DM can be unavoidably generated via annihilation of particles in the standard model (SM) thermal plasma. It is known that the SM thermal plasma also produces gravitational waves (GWs). In this study, we point out a simple and tight connection between the amplitude of the thermal GWs and the properties of pure gravitational DM. Notably, future GW experiments in the ultra-high frequency regime have the potential to shed light on the mass and spin of pure gravitational DM.</description>

      <title>Topological dark energy from black-hole formations and mergers through the gravity-thermodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach in the case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, and its corresponding Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy, which due to the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem it is related to the Euler characteristic of the Universe topology. However, we consider the realistic scenario where we have the formation and merger of black holes that lead to topology changes, which induce entropy changes in the Universe horizon. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector of topological origin. We estimate the black-hole formation and merger rates starting from the observed star formation rate per redshift, which is parametrized very efficiently by the Madau-Dickinson form, and finally we result to a dark-energy energy density that depends on the cosmic star formation rate density, on the fraction $f_{\text{BH}}$ of stars forming black holes, on the fraction of black holes $f_\text{merge}$ that eventually merge, on the fraction $ f_{\text{bin}}$ of massive stars that are in binaries, on the average mass of progenitor stars that will evolve to form black holes $ \langle m_{\text{prog}} \rangle $, as well as on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. We investigate in detail the cosmological evolution, obtaining the usual thermal history. Concerning the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, we show that at intermediate redshifts it exhibits phantom-like or quintessence-like behavior according to the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while at early and late times it tends to the cosmological constant value. Finally, we study the effect of the other model parameters, showing that for the whole allowed observationally estimated ranges, the topological dark-energy equation-of-state parameter remains within its observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Axion-like Particles from Massive Stars with X-rays and Gamma Rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot interiors of massive stars in the later stages of their evolution provide an ideal place for the production of heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) with mass up to O(100 keV) range. We show that a fraction of these ALPs could stream out of the stellar photosphere and subsequently decay into two photons that can be potentially detected on or near the Earth. In particular, we estimate the photon flux originating from the spontaneous decay of heavy ALPs produced inside Horizontal Branch and Wolf-Rayet stars, and assess its detectability by current and future $X$-ray and gamma-ray telescopes. Our results indicate that current and future telescopes can probe axion-photon couplings down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 4\times 10^{-11}$ GeV${}^{-1}$ for $m_a\sim 10-100$ keV, which covers new ground in the ALP parameter space.</description>

      <title>Causality and Stability from Acoustic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions form backgrounds which spontaneously break Lorentz invariance. We investigate the dynamics of free scalar perturbations on general anisotropic backgrounds. We demonstrate that the phonons move on null geodesics of an acoustic spacetime described by its own metric and own connection featuring nonmetricity with respect to the usual spacetime metric. We give distinct physical interpretations to the acoustic metric and its inverse. The first defines rays and their phase velocities. The latter defines momenta and the dispersion relation. We classify possible acoustic geometries and provide a physical interpretation for them.
  We discuss the phonon properties that moving observers, inequivalent owing to the breaking of Lorentz invariance, would measure. Ghosts and true gradient instabilities are to be read off from invariant properties of the acoustic metric - its signature and determinant. However, the choice of the observer's frame can cause some confusion and paradoxes, including apparent instabilities. For instance, complex phonon energies can appear entirely due to the ill-posedness of the Cauchy problem in the frame chosen. On the other hand, unbounded negative phonon energies can appear, without ghosts or gradient instabilities, for observers moving supersonically, when phonon Cherenkov radiation can be emitted.
  The action for phonons also gives an acoustically covariantly conserved energy-momentum tensor (EMT) which is, however, not conserved in the usual spacetime. Nonetheless, in the presence of an acoustic timelike Killing vector, the acoustic Hamiltonian functional is a conserved charge in both the acoustic and in the usual spacetimes, and even has the same value in both. Thus, the acoustic Hamiltonian can be used to bound the motion of phonons interacting with other species living in the usual spacetime.</description>

      <title>Limits on Clustering and Smooth Quintessence from the EFTofLSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.07554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) to analyze cosmological models with clustering quintessence, which allows us to consistently describe the parameter region in which the quintessence equation of state $w &lt; - 1$. First, we extend the description of biased tracers in redshift space to the presence of clustering quintessence, and compute the one-loop power spectrum. We solve the EFTofLSS equations using the exact time dependence, which is relevant to obtain unbiased constraints. Then, fitting the full shape of BOSS pre-reconstructed power spectrum measurements, the BOSS post-reconstruction BAO measurements, BAO measurements from 6DF/MGS and eBOSS, the Supernovae from Pantheon, and a prior from BBN, we bound the clustering quintessence equation of state parameter $w=-1.011_{-0.048}^{+0.053}$ at $68\%$ C.L.. Further combining with Planck, we obtain $w=-1.028_{-0.030}^{+0.037}$ at $68\%$ C.L.. We also obtain constraints on smooth quintessence, in the physical regime $w \geq -1$: combining all datasets, we get $-1\leq w &lt; - 0.979$ at $68\%$ C.L.. These results strongly support a cosmological constant.</description>

This allows us to adjust the power-counting rules of the theory, and to explicitly identify that the leading next-order terms have a specific dependence on the cosine of the angle between the line-of-sight and the wavenumber of the observable, $\mu$. Such a specific $\mu$-dependence allows us to construct a linear combination of the data multipoles, $\slashed{P}$, where these contributions are effectively projected out, so that EFTofLSS predictions for $\slashed{P}$ have a much smaller theoretical error and so a much higher $k$-reach. The remaining data are organized in wedges in $\mu$ space, have a $\mu$-dependent $k$-reach because they are not equally affected by the leading next-order contributions, and therefore can have a higher $k$-reach than the multipoles. Furthermore, by explicitly including the highest next-order terms, we define a `one-loop+' procedure, where the wedges have even higher $k$-reach. We study the effectiveness of these two procedures on several sets of simulations and on the BOSS data. The resulting analysis has identical computational cost as the multipole-based one, but leads to an improvement on the determination of some of the cosmological parameters that ranges from $10\%$ to $100\%$, depending on the survey properties.</description>

      <title>Gravitational to Coulomb force ratio and the origin of the Cosmic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14930v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the seeds of galactic magnetic fields is a subject that remains under debate. Here we will explore a simple source based on tiny charge asymmetries in slowly rotating protogalaxies. We use current knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution to estimate that a charge imbalance of $1$ every $\sim 10^{38\pm 5}$ charge carriers in slowly rotating protogalaxies can provide adequate seeds for the galactic dynamos. Interestingly, this is of the same order than the ratio of gravitational to Coulomb forces between the elementary plasma constituents. Motivated by this fact, we study different mechanisms for generating such charge imbalances from a direct interplay of gravitational and Coulomb forces, namely the possibility that these are of primordial origin, that stellar or primordial black holes redistribute charge in protogalaxies, or that the imbalance is sourced by gravity as the galaxy forms in quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium. Our results show that primordial asymmetries drop to small values by the onset of galaxy formation, with an amplitude that is similar to the possible charge asymmetries that could be produced by black holes. Although these charge asymmetries can have values within the range of interest, they are much smaller than the gravitationally induced one in hydrostatic equilibrium conditions. The latter lies in the upper range of the required charge imbalance.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results I. Improved data selection and processing</title>

Abstract: The CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder is performing line intensity mapping of CO emission to trace the distribution of unresolved galaxies at redshift $z \sim 3$. We present an improved version of the COMAP data processing pipeline and apply this to the first two seasons of observations. This analysis improves on the COMAP Early Science (ES) results in several key aspects. On the observational side, all second season scans were made in constant-elevation mode, after noting that the previous Lissajous scans were associated with increased systematic errors; those scans accounted for 50% of the total Season 1 data volume. Secondly, all new observations were restricted to an elevation range of 35-65 degrees, to minimize sidelobe ground pickup. On the data processing side, more effective data cleaning in both the time- and map-domain has allowed us to eliminate all data-driven power spectrum-based cuts. This increases the overall data retention and reduces the risk of signal subtraction bias. On the other hand, due to the increased sensitivity, two new pointing-correlated systematic errors have emerged, and we introduce a new map-domain PCA filter to suppress these. Subtracting only 5 out of 256 PCA modes, we find that the standard deviation of the cleaned maps decreases by 67% on large angular scales, and after applying this filter, the maps appear consistent with instrumental noise. Combining all these improvements, we find that each hour of raw Season 2 observations yields on average 3.2 times more cleaned data compared to ES analysis. Combining this with the increase in raw observational hours, the effective amount of data available for high-level analysis is a factor of 8 higher than in ES. The resulting maps have reached an uncertainty of $25$-$50\,\mu K$ per voxel, providing by far the strongest constraints on cosmological CO line emission published to date.</description>

      <title>Chasing cosmic inflation: constraints for inflationary models and reheating insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of different choice of prior's range for the reheating epoch on cosmic inflation parameter inference in light of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements from the {\em Planck} 2018 legacy release in combination with BICEP/Keck Array 2018 data and additional late-time cosmological observations such as uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon catalogue, baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions from SDSS/BOSS/eBOSS. Here, we explore in particular the implications for the combination of reheating and inflationary-model parameter space considering $R+R^2$ inflation and a broad class of $\alpha$-attractor and D-brane models. Propagating the uncertainties due to an unknown reheating phase, these inflationary models completely cover the $n_{\rm s}$-$r$ parameter space allowed by {\em Planck} and BICEP/Keck data and represent good targets for future CMB and large-scale structure experiments. We perform a Bayesian model comparison of inflationary models, taking into account the reheating uncertainties assuming a conservative but accurate modelling of inflationary predictions. $R+R^2$ inflation, T-model $\alpha$-attractor inflation for $n=1$, E-model $\alpha$-attractor inflation for $n=1/2$, and KKLT inflation for $p=5$ are the better performing models, with none being preferred at a statistically significant level.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from an interrupted phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of primordial black hole formation via an interrupted phase transition during the early matter-dominated stage of reheating after inflation. In reheating, induced by the decay of a pressureless fluid dominating the Universe at the end of inflation, dubbed as reheaton, the temperature of the radiation bath typically increases, reaching a maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$, and then decreases. We consider a first-order phase transition induced by the increase of the temperature that is aborted as $T_{\rm max}$ is higher than the critical temperature but not sufficiently high for the bubble nucleation rate to overcome the expansion of the Universe. Although bubbles never fully occupy the space, some may be nucleated and expand until the temperature once again decreases to the critical temperature. We argue that these bubbles shrink and disappear as the temperature drops further, leaving behind macroscopic spherical regions with positive density perturbations. These perturbed regions accrete the surrounding matter (reheatons) and eventually collapse into primordial black holes whose mass continues to grow until the onset of radiation domination. We estimate the abundance of these primordial black holes in terms of the bubble nucleation rate at $T_{\rm max}$, and demonstrate that the abundance can be significantly large from a phenomenological perspective.</description>

      <title>A halo model approach for mock catalogs of time-variable strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delays in both galaxy- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses have recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of the Hubble tension. Future wide-field cadenced surveys, such as the LSST, are anticipated to discover strong lenses across various scales. We generate mock catalogs of strongly lensed QSOs and SNe on galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scales based on a halo model that incorporates dark matter halos, galaxies, and subhalos. For the upcoming LSST survey, we predict that approximately 3500 lensed QSOs and 200 lensed SNe with resolved multiple images will be discovered. Among these, about 80 lensed QSOs and 10 lensed SNe will have maximum image separations larger than 10 arcsec, which roughly correspond to cluster-scale strong lensing. We find that adopting the Chabrier stellar IMF instead of the fiducial Salpeter IMF reduces the predicted number of strong lenses approximately by half, while the distributions of lens and source redshifts and image separations are not significantly changed. In addition to mock catalogs of multiple-image lens systems, we create mock catalogs of highly magnified systems, including both multiple-image and single-image systems. We find that such highly magnified systems are typically produced by massive galaxies, but non-negligible fraction of them are located in the outskirt of galaxy groups and clusters. Furthermore, we compare subsamples of our mock catalogs with lensed QSO samples constructed from the SDSS and Gaia to find that our mock catalogs with the fiducial Salpeter IMF reproduce the observation quite well. In contrast, our mock catalogs with the Chabrier IMF predict a significantly smaller number of lensed QSOs compared with observations, which adds evidence that the stellar IMF of massive galaxies is Salpeter-like. Our python code SL-Hammocks as well as the mock catalogs are made available online. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for collisionless Boltzmann simulation of self-gravitating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) is a fundamental equation that governs the dynamics of a broad range of astrophysical systems from space plasma to star clusters and galaxies. It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a multi-dimensional phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova &amp; Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on Nv , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64*64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>TeV Scale Resonant Leptogenesis with triplet Fermion in Connection to Muon $g-2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the minimal scotogenic model with a triplet fermion and a singlet scalar. An imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry allows only diagonal Yukawa couplings among different generations of SM leptons and right-handed singlet neutrinos. The Yukawa coupling of the triplet fermion with the inert doublet positively contributes to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The imposed $Z_{4}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry forbids the conventional leptogenesis from the lightest right-handed neutrino decay. A net lepton asymmetry can be generated in the muonic sector from $N_{2}$ and triplet fermion decay through resonant leptogenesis scenario. The Yukawa coupling of triplet plays significant role both in leptogenesis and in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We show a viable parameter space for TeV scale leptogenesis while explaining the Fermi lab results. The inert scalar is the dark matter candidate in this model. The Muon $(g-2)$ and dark matter both favor the same parameter space for mass of the dark matter and the triplet fermion.</description>

      <title>Revisiting spins of primordial black holes in a matter-dominated era based on peak theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the probability distribution for the spins of the primordial black holes (PBHs) that formed during an early matter-dominated era in the Universe. We employ the Zel'dovich approximation and focus on the linear-order effect of cosmological perturbations which causes the tidal torque. Assuming that the fluctuations obey Gaussian statistics, we apply the peak theory of random Gaussian variables to compute the root mean square (RMS) and the probability distribution of the non-dimensional Kerr parameter $a_{*}$ at their formation. The value of $a_{*}$ is evaluated through the angular momentum at the turn-around time. We find that the RMS $\bar{a}_{*}$ with a given amplitude of the fluctuation $\delta_{\rm{pk}}$ decreases with the amplitude. This behavior allows us to set the threshold value of the amplitude of the fluctuation through the under-extremal condition $\bar{a}_{*}&lt;1$. Then we discuss the impact of spin and anisotropic collapse on the production rate of PBHs. We find that, for $\sigma_{H}\leq 10^{-3}$ with $\sigma_{\rm H}$ being the square root of the variance of the fluctuation at the horizon reentry, the suppression from the spin effect is dominant, while the effect of anisotropy becomes more important for $\sigma_{H}&gt;10^{-3}$. Since $\bar{a}_{*}$ can be written as a function of $\nu:=\delta_{\rm{pk}}/\sigma_{\rm H}$, we can obtain the probability distribution of $\bar a_*$, $P(\bar a_*)$, through the probability distribution of $\nu$ characterized by a given power spectrum of the fluctuation. $P(\bar a_*)$ depends on $\sigma_{\rm H}$ and the parameter $\gamma$ that characterizes the width of the power spectrum. It is shown that, in the parameter regions of our interests, substantial values of PBH spins are expected in contrast to the PBH formation in a radiation-dominated universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the generation of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from interactions in the thermal plasma. We extend the existing literature by incorporating the reheating phase into the thermal history. Our results show that the amplitude of the GW spectrum can be significantly enhanced because the temperature during reheating can be much higher than the reheating temperature. Furthermore, since the temperature evolution during reheating differs from that of free radiation, the peak frequency of the spectrum can also shift. Additionally, the morphology of the spectrum can present characteristic features. We also compute the contribution of the integrated GW spectrum to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, which can be substantially larger.</description>

Abstract: Based on the Newtonian mechanics, in this article, we present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Additionally, using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at linear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.</description>

      <title>Photon proliferation from N-body dark matter annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a photon proliferation effect from N-body dark matter (DM) annihilation in the early Universe, which can induce a drastic photon-temperature shift after neutrino decoupling. For pseudoscalar DM mass below the eV scale, we show that the photon proliferation effect becomes significant as the mass approaches the ultralight end, due to the huge enhancement from the background DM number density. This presents the leading constraints on the DM-photon coupling, DM self-interaction, and DM-electron coupling, which are stronger than the existing bounds up to several orders of magnitude. The present research can be extended to other interactions and DM candidates, and highlights the importance of multi-body processes in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>MPI-Rockstar: a Hybrid MPI and OpenMP Parallel Implementation of the Rockstar Halo finder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MPI-Rockstar is a massively parallel halo finder based on the Rockstar phase-space temporal halo finder code, which is one of the most extensively used halo finding codes. Compared to the original code, parallelized by a primitive socket communication library, we parallelized it in a hybrid way using MPI and OpenMP, which is suitable for analysis on the hybrid shared and distributed memory environments of modern supercomputers. This implementation can easily handle the analysis of more than a trillion particles on more than 100,000 parallel processes, enabling the production of a huge dataset for the next generation of cosmological surveys. As new functions to the original Rockstar code, MPI-Rockstar supports HDF5 as an output format and can output additional halo properties such as the inertia tensor.</description>
