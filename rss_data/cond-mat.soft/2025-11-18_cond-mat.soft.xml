      <title>Topological flowscape reveals state transitions in nonreciprocal living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions-- where forces between entities are asymmetric-- govern a wide range of nonequilibrium phenomena, yet their role in structural transitions in living and active systems remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a transition between nonreciprocal states using starfish embryos at different stages of development, where interactions are inherently asymmetric and tunable. Experiments, interaction inference, and topological analysis yield a nonreciprocal state diagram spanning crystalline, flocking, and fragmented states, revealing that weak nonreciprocity promotes structural order while stronger asymmetry disrupts it. To capture these transitions, we introduce topological landscapes, mapping the distribution of structural motifs across state space. We further develop topological flowscapes, a dynamic framework that quantifies transitions between collective states and detects an informational rate shift from the experimental state transition. Together, these results establish a general approach for decoding nonequilibrium transitions and uncover how asymmetric interactions sculpt the dynamical and structural architecture of active and living matter.</description>

      <title>Wrinkling in Sheets with Nonuniform Growth and Bending Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin elastic sheets bend easily, leading to mechanical instabilities such as wrinkling. Here, we investigate wrinkles at edges of bi-strips, which consist of two thin sheets, one that swells and one that does not, joined side-by-side. It is well known that when bending rigidity is uniform across an isolated bi-strip, swelling results in axisymmetric shapes like a wine bottle: two cylinders of different radii are joined by a smooth transition zone. However, when the bending rigidity of the swollen sheet differs from that of the non-swollen sheet, purely axisymmetric shapes are no longer energetically favorable, and wrinkles arise. When the bending rigidity of the non-swollen sheet is essentially infinite, the wrinkles coarsen with distance from the transition zone such that dimensionless wavelengths and widths are related by $\tilde{\lambda} \propto \tilde{w}^{2/3}$. If the bending rigidity of the non-swollen sheet is non-infinite (but~still significantly larger than that of the swollen sheet), then the non-swollen sheet assumes a non-infinite radius of curvature, $R_0$. We find that the wrinkles in this system extend a critical distance, $w_C$, beyond the junction of the two strips and that $w_C \propto R_0$. Local undulations of wrinkles are favorable in this system because they decrease the overall bending energy by allowing the non-swollen sheet to have a larger radius of curvature than would otherwise be dictated by its reference geometry. Our results are relevant to a wide range of sheets that experience non-uniform growth, whether in natural systems such as plants or in synthetic systems such as designed, responsive materials.</description>

      <title>Tunable Nanostructures from Inverse Surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical materials in the natural world are often made through the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules. Achieving similar structural complexity in synthetic materials requires understanding how various molecular parameters affect assembly behavior. In recent years, inverse surfactants -- molecules with hydrophobic head groups and hydrophilic macromolecular tails -- have been shown to self-assemble into supramolecular assemblies in aqueous solutions that show promise for a number of applications, including drug delivery. Here, we build an understanding of the morphological phase diagram of inverse surfactants using insights from scattering experiments, computer simulations, and statistical mechanics. The scattering and simulation results reveal that changing the head-group size is an important molecular knob in controlling morphological transitions. The molecular size ratio of the hydrophobic group to the hydrophilic emerges as a crucial dimensionless quantity in our theory and plays a determining role in setting the micelle structure and the transition from mesoscale to macroscale aggregates. Our minimal theory is able to qualitatively explain the key features of the morphological phase diagram, including the prevalence of fiber-like structures in comparison to spherical and planar micelles. Together, these findings provide a more complete picture for the molecular dependencies of assemblies of inverse surfactants, which we hope may aid in the de novo design of supramolecular structures.</description>

      <title>A Complex Topological Phase in C-Spin Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new theoretical model for active matter ("complementary-spins" or c-spins), exploring the interplay of positional and orientational order in mobile agents with rotational freedom, divided into two populations with contrasting interactions. The system's behavior depends on its size and a control parameter (circular anisotropy) that splits the agents' natural rotational frequencies. Key findings include distinct phases based on anisotropy: Small Anisotropy: Stable, regular equilibrium patterns emerge. Moderate Anisotropy: Formation of complex, non-equilibrium topological point defects (vortex states), which are bistable with uniform patterns. These robust, self-repairing defects exhibit counter-rotating c-spin loop trains, spin-momentum locking, and dissipationless flow, classified by a two-valued topological charge. High Anisotropy: Transition to active turbulence and loss of order. Statistical analysis reveals a double phase transition at a critical value: a standard symmetry-breaking transition and a novel topological phase transition activating the vortex complexes. Increasing system size enhances organizational complexity and the development of spin-momentum locked transport networks. This model provides a new framework for understanding robustness and morphogenesis in living systems.</description>

      <title>Bacterial turbulence at compressible fluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense bacterial suspensions at fluid interfaces provide a natural platform to explore active turbulence in a dimensional mismatch: active units are restricted to a two-dimensional surface, while the induced flows extend into the surrounding three-dimensional liquid. Using hydrophobic Serratia marcescens at the air-water interface, we realize interfacial bacterial turbulence as a distinct class of active turbulence. The system exhibits compressible in-plane flows, with vortex size initially increasing with the thickness of the underlying fluid and saturating near 100 $\mu$ m, independent of bacterial length. This behavior contrasts sharply with bulk active turbulence, where correlation length typically scales with system size. Hydrodynamic theory, together with direct measurements of the three-dimensional flow field, shows that the coupling between interfacial and bulk flows sets the emergent length scale. Our results uncover the fundamental physics of interfacial bacterial turbulence and open new strategies for geometric control of collective active flows.</description>

      <title>Collective bacterial motion drives interfacial waves and shape dynamics in phase-separated droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid--liquid phase separation governs a broad spectrum of phenomena in biology, physics, and materials science. While traditionally explored in equilibrium contexts, growing evidence underscores the transformative role of active components, such as motor proteins, enzymatic catalysts, and synthetic microswimmers, in modulating the dynamics of phase-separated systems. Here, we encapsulate motile bacteria within phase-separated aqueous droplets to examine how internal activity shapes interfacial behavior. By tuning bacterial density, we control the magnitude of active stresses at the droplet interface. At low activity, we observe scale-dependent interfacial fluctuations featuring propagative wave modes.Remarkably, despite the low Reynolds number regime, these waves arise from an effective inertial response that emerges when bacterial active stresses balance viscous dissipation. At high activity, droplets exhibit pronounced deformation that exceeds the Rayleigh-Plateau instability threshold, accompanied by enhanced motility that accelerates coarsening. Our findings demonstrate how active stresses can reshape morphology and dynamics in multiphase systems, offering new insights into the physics of internally driven phase-separated fluids.</description>

      <title>Entropic alignment of topologically modified ring polymers in cylindrical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under high cylindrical confinement, segments of ring polymers can be localized along the long axis of the cylinder by introducing internal loops within the ring polymer. The emergent organization of the polymer segments occurs because of the entropic repulsion between internal loops. These principles were used to identify the underlying mechanism of bacterial chromosome organization. Here, we outline functional principles associated with entropic interactions, leading to specific orientations of the ring polymers relative to their neighbors in the cylindrical confinement. We achieve this by modifying the ring polymer topology by creating internal loops of two different sizes within the polymer, and thus create an asymmetry. This allows us to strategically manipulate polymer topology such that segments of a polymer face certain other segments of a neighboring polymer. The polymers therefore behave as if they are subjected to an `effective' entropic interaction reminiscent of interactions between Ising spins. But this emergent spatial and orientational organization is not enthalpy-driven. We consider a bead spring model of flexible polymers with only repulsive excluded volume interactions between the monomers. The polymers entropically repel each other and occupy different halves of the cylinder, and moreover, the adjacent polymers preferentially re-orient themselves along the axis of the cylinder. We further substantiate our observations by free energy calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the emergence of effective orientational interactions by harnessing entropic interactions in flexible polymers. The principles elucidated here could be relevant to understand the interactions between different sized loops within a large chromosome.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Mechanics of Arterial Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a geometric theory of the mechanics of arterial growth. An artery is modeled as a finite-length thick shell that is made of an incompressible nonlinear anisotropic solid. An initial radially-symmetric distribution of finite radial and circumferential eigenstrains is assumed. Bulk growth is assumed to be isotropic. A novel framework is proposed to describe the time evolution of growth, governed by a competition between the elastic energy and a \emph{growth energy}. The governing equations are derived through a two-potential approach and using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. An isotropic dissipation potential is considered, which is assumed to be convex in the rate of growth function. Several numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting the evolution of arterial growth and the intricate interplay among eigenstrains, residual stresses, elastic energy, growth energy, and dissipation potential. A distinctive feature of the model is that the growth variable is not constrained by an explicit upper bound; instead, growth naturally approaches a steady-state value as a consequence of the intrinsic energetic competition.</description>

      <title>Shape Characterization of Ferrous Burden Material of Blast Furnace Feed using Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we attempt to characterize the shape of three different types of grains commonly used in the iron and steel-making industry, namely pellet, sinter and iron ore lump. We choose particles over the entire size ranges used in industrial-scale blast furnace and consider two different size ranges of pellet particles and four different size ranges for sinter and iron ore lumps. We perform image analysis to calculate size and shape-related properties of the grains. We select some of the common length scales used to measure the size of the particles and categorize them in different classes. We show that the length scales of a particular category class are well correlated with each other. We identify the independent, uncorrelated length scales for the particles from different categories. Using these uncorrelated length scales, we define different shape descriptors and obtain the distribution of these shape descriptors for each component of the blast furnace feed. Our image analysis results show that the cumulative distribution curves for these shape descriptors turn out to be nearly independent of the size range for a given type of material. Our study identifies the three key shape descriptors that are required to characterize the shape of the blast furnace feed. Two of these shape descriptors, namely the aspect ratio and the circularity, have been considered important by the researchers earlier as well. The third shape descriptor, the average contact eccentricity to the projected particle diameter ratio, usually not considered to be an important shape descriptor in previous studies, is of high relevance for Discrete Element Method simulations of granular materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Networking of Polymer Networks with Dedicated Cross-linker Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends a field-theoretical dynamical networking formalism for mesoscopic polymer dynamics to explicitly include dedicated cross-linker particles. Cross-linkers are represented within a Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functional and reversibly coupled to polymers through Gaussian networking fields, enabling an approximation scheme that reduces their degrees of freedom while remaining compatible with polymer dynamics. The framework is applied to a two-species polymer system in which intra- and inter-species cross-linking are assigned different statistical advantages. Effective networking potentials are derived and used to calculate correlation functions and dynamic structure factors. To validate these results, molecular dynamics simulations of semi-flexible polymers with reversible intra- and inter-species cross-linking are performed. Simulations show that cross-linking decreases polymer persistence lengths and local alignment, and the resulting trajectories yield dynamic structure factors consistent with theoretical predictions. In both approaches, cross-linking broadens the diffusive peaks and enhances the high-frequency tails of the structure factors. Together, theory and simulation provide complementary insights into the dynamics of cross-linked polymers, establishing a tractable framework that captures essential features observed in experiments and offering a basis for exploring more complex synthetic and biological networks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the experimental foundation with rupture and delayed rupture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out uniaxial continuous and step stretching of various crosslinked polymer networks to demonstrate how characteristics of rupture (from continuous stretching) and delayed rupture (from step stretching) can be used to probe the structure of the emergent kinetic theory of bond dissociation (KTBD) for elastomeric failure. Based on delayed rupture experiments, we show that the network lifetime tntw, taken as the incubation time for delayed rupture, depends on temperature in an Arrhenius like manner and is exponentially sensitive to the degree of network stretching (depicted by step-stretch ratio ). Rupture during continuous stretching for a wide range of stretch rates takes place on timescales inversely proportional to the stretch rate. The elapsed time at rupture is found to be comparable to at various values of L/L0b = L/L0ss in a wide range of temperature, affording the experimental basis for the premise of the KTBD. Having identified the hidden internal clock , continuous stretching tests at different temperatures are performed to show the existence of a new time temperature equivalence (TTE): fast stretching at higher temperatures is equivalent to slow stretching at lower temperatures: different pairs of rate and temperature can produce the rupture at the same tensile strength and strain.</description>

      <title>Omics-scale polymer computational database transferable to real-world artificial intelligence applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing large-scale foundational datasets is a critical milestone in advancing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven scientific innovation. However, unlike AI-mature fields such as natural language processing, materials science, particularly polymer research, has significantly lagged in developing extensive open datasets. This lag is primarily due to the high costs of polymer synthesis and property measurements, along with the vastness and complexity of the chemical space. This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the "more is better" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance. This unprecedented omics-scale database reveals vast unexplored regions of polymer materials, providing a foundation for AI-driven polymer science.</description>

      <title>Martini Mapper: An Automated Fragment-Based Framework for Developing Coarse-Grained Models within the Martini 3 Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($\Delta G_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.</description>

      <title>Crossover dynamics and non-Gaussian fluctuations in inertial active chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of inertial active particles in a one-dimensional chain with harmonic nearest-neighbor interactions, highlighting the interplay of persistence, interaction, and inertial timescales. Using a Green's function approach, we derive the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and mean-squared change in velocity (MSCV), revealing multiple crossovers between ballistic, diffusive, and subdiffusive regimes and providing analytic expressions for scaling coefficients and crossover times. Non-Gaussian deviations in active Brownian particles are captured through excess kurtosis, reflecting heavy-tailed, finite-support, or bimodal distributions that evolve systematically over time. Time-dependent probability distributions exhibit distinct data collapses within different temporal regimes, confirming the robustness of the scaling behavior. Overall, this framework connects multiparticle interactions to microscopic dynamics, revealing experimentally accessible signatures of inertia in active matter.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of solitary waves in active flow networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow networks are fundamental for understanding systems such as animal and plant vasculature or power distribution grids. These networks can encode, transmit, and transform information embodied in the spatial and temporal distribution of their flows. In this work, we focus on a minimal yet physically grounded system that allows us to isolate the fundamental mechanisms by which active flow networks generate and regulate emergent dynamics capable of supporting information transmission. The system is composed of active units that pump fluid and elastic units that store volume. From first principles, we derive a discrete model-an active flow network-that enables the simulation of large systems with many interacting units. Numerically, we show that the pressure field can develop solitary waves, resulting in the spontaneous creation and transmission of localized packets of information stored in the physical properties of the flow. We characterize how these solitary waves emerge from disordered initial conditions in a one-dimensional network, and how their size and propagation speed depend on key system parameters. Finally, when the elastic units are coupled to their neighbors, the solitary waves exhibit even richer dynamics, with diverse shapes and finite lifetimes that display power-law behaviors that we can predict analytically. Together, these results show how simple fluidic elements can collectively create, shape and transport information, laying the foundations for understanding-and ultimately engineering-information processing in active flow systems.</description>

      <title>Structural Relaxation in Simple Yield Stress Materials Influences Their Rheology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simple yield stress materials are composed of soft particles, bubbles, or droplets with purely repulsive forces. The constituent elements are typically too large to undergo thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the internal structure of the material, and therefore the rheology, should not change over time. We explore the rheology of Carbopol, a prototypical simple yield stress material, and show that gradual structural relaxation of the material results in a small yet significant reduction in the dynamic yield stress. This relaxation process can lead to a non-monotonic creep deformation rate under constant stress, culminating in delayed fluidization of the material. These findings show that the yield stress is not merely a static material property but may be a function of the internal structure of the material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemotaxis allows single cells to self-organize at the population level, as classically described by Keller-Segel models. We show that chemotactic aggregation can be understood using a generalized Maxwell construction based on the balance of density fluxes and reactive turnover. This formulation implies that aggregates generically undergo coarsening, which is interrupted and reversed by cell growth and death. Together, both stable and spatiotemporally dynamic aggregates emerge. Our theory mechanistically links chemotactic self-organization to phase separation and reaction-diffusion patterns.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of chemotactic aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auto-chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients in chemicals they secrete, is central to the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in biological systems. Since the introduction of the Keller--Segel model, numerous variants have been analyzed, revealing phenomena such as coarsening of aggregates, stable aggregate sizes, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics. Here, we consider general mass-conserving Keller--Segel models, that is, models without cell growth and death, and analyze the generic long-time dynamics of the chemotactic aggregates. Building on and extending our previous work, which demonstrated that chemotactic aggregation can be understood through a generalized Maxwell construction balancing density fluxes and reactive turnover, we use singular perturbation theory to derive the rates of mass competition between well-separated aggregates. We analyze how this mass-competition process drives coarsening in both diffusion- and reaction-limited regimes, with the diffusion-limited rate aligning with our previous quasi-steady-state analyses. Our results generalize earlier mathematical findings, demonstrating that coarsening is driven by self-amplifying mass transport and aggregate coalescence. Additionally, we provide a linear stability analysis of the lateral instability, predicting it through a nullcline-slope criterion that parallels the curvature criterion in spinodal decomposition. Overall, our findings suggest that chemotactic aggregates behave similarly to phase-separating droplets, providing a robust framework for understanding the coarse-grained dynamics of auto-chemotactic cell populations and a quantitative basis for comparing chemotactic coarsening to canonical non-equilibrium phase separation.</description>

      <title>Ordered buckling structures in a twisted crimped tube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a ribbon or tube is twisted far enough it forms buckles and wrinkles. Its new geometry can be strikingly ordered, or hopelessly disordered. Here we study this process in a tube with hybrid boundary conditions: one end a cylinder, and the other end crimped flat like a ribbon, so that the sample resembles a toothpaste tube. The resulting irregular structures and mechanical responses can be dramatically different from those of a ribbon. However, when we form two creases in the tube prior to twisting, we obtain an ordered structure composed of repeating triangular facets oriented at varying angles, and a more elastic torque response, reminiscent of the creased helicoid structure of a twisted ribbon. We measure how the torque and structural evolution depend on parameters such as material thickness and the twist angle. When only part of the tube is pre-creased, the ordered structures are confined to this segment. Surprisingly, in some tubes made from thicker sheets, an ordered structure forms without pre-creasing. This study provides insights into controlling the buckling of thin shells, offering a potential pathway for designing ordered structures in soft materials.</description>

Abstract: Avalanches are rapid cascades of rearrangements driven by cooperative flipping of hysteretic local elements. Here we show that flipping dynamics and race conditions -- where multiple elements become unstable simultaneously -- give rise to dynamic avalanches that cannot be captured by static models of interacting elements. We realize dynamic avalanches in metamaterials with controlled flipping times and demonstrate how this allows us to modify, promote, and direct avalanche behavior. Our work elucidates the crucial role of internal dynamics in complex materials and introduces dynamic design principles for materializing targeted pathways and sequential functionalities.</description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions Controlled by Tunable Metastability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of thermal fluctuations on the morphology of two-dimensional materials are hard to harness. We propose that a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon (GNR) can exhibit thermally activated snap-through transitions with a predictable and controllable transition rate constant. The energetics and kinetics of such transitions can be fully captured by combining enhanced sampling methods and generalized transition state theory. Using well-tempered metadynamics, we determine the free energy landscape and a pair of asymmetric transition pathways of the GNR system. Notably, generalized transition state theory accurately captures how the transition rate constant responds to temperature and the tunable free energy landscape of our system. This work offers a theoretical framework for elastic metastability, introduces rare event methods into thermalized nanomechanical systems, and provides potential applications in designing nanoscale thermal switches and thermal actuators.</description>

      <title>Parameter degeneracy in the vertex model for tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vertex model with homogeneous cell properties is known to exhibit a parameter degeneracy in which the system's dynamics is independent of the target area. Here, we show, for the heterogeneous vertex model where cells differ in size and stiffness, that degeneracy is also present with the average product of target areas and stiffness becoming dynamically irrelevant. Fixing this quantity is equivalent to fixing the global internal tissue pressure. Unless properly treated, this degeneracy undermines the physical relevance of key observables' numerical values, such as cell target shape index, cell pressure, and cell stress tensor. We present methods to resolve the degeneracy and to correctly set the gauge pressure via symmetry transformations applied to the cells' target areas. We further demonstrate that the degeneracy is removed under certain boundary conditions and partially lifted when spherical tissues are modeled using a locally planar approximation, leading to numerical consequences when fitting model parameters to experimental data. The approach extends beyond vertex models and provides a framework for testing whether the parameter spaces of other physical models are free from degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Shape of liquid meniscus in open cells of varying geometry: a combined study via simulation and experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaporative lithography in cells of arbitrary configuration allows for the creation of diverse particle deposition patterns due to the formation of a specific flow structure in the liquid caused by non-uniform evaporation. The latter in turn is determined by the shape of the liquid layer surface and the wetting menisci on the cell walls. Thus, predicting the shape of the wetting menisci can serve as a tool for controlling the process of creating desired particle deposition patterns and evaporation dynamics. Here, we propose a simple and sufficiently accurate methodology for determining the shape of the liquid meniscus in cells of arbitrary geometric shape, based on a combination of mathematical modeling and a series of experimental measurement techniques. The surface profiles of the liquid meniscus in cylindrical, square, and triangular cells were determined by measuring the change in the reflection angle of a laser beam from the free liquid surface while scanning from the cell wall to its center. The height of the wetting meniscus on the inner cell wall and the minimum liquid layer thickness at the center of the cell were measured by analyzing optical images and using a contact method, respectively. 3D meniscus profiles were obtained by numerically solving the Helmholtz equation. The boundary conditions and the unknown constant in the equation were determined based on experimental data obtained for several local points or cross-sections. The simulated meniscus shapes showed satisfactory agreement with the experimental local measurements, with a maximum relative error of less than 14%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epithelial tissues are driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium by internally generated forces, causing complex patterns of motion. Even when both the forces and motion are measurable, it is not yet possible to relate the two, because the sources of energy injection and dissipation are often unclear. Here, we study how energy is transferred by developing a method to measure the effective viscosity from the shear stresses and strain rates within an epithelial cell monolayer. Interestingly, there emerged multicellular regions in which the relationship between shear stress and shear strain rate was negatively proportional, indicating a negative effective viscosity. The negative effective viscosity occurred in regions wherein cell stresses were less efficient at producing tissue deformations compared to regions of positive effective viscosity. Regions of negative effective viscosity consistently exhibited greater cell speed and vorticity, and the cells had elevated metabolic activity, reflecting an increased energy demand in these cells. Our study shows that negative effective viscosity is a useful means of quantifying the flow of energy in living matter.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</description>

Abstract: We develop a one-dimensional network model to predict the steady-state distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds under wall-slip conditions. The model accounts for major friction losses between junctions and incorporates wall slip through a power-law relation calibrated independently via capillary rheometry. Predictions from the model are validated against both bench-scale experiments and fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, showing excellent agreement across a range of flow conditions. Our results demonstrate that wall slip strongly influences the uniformity of fluid distribution by modifying the relative resistance between outlet branches. Furthermore, we show that the problem can be inverted: measured distribution profiles can be used to estimate slip parameters, offering a practical method for slip characterisation without pressure measurement. This modelling framework is computationally inexpensive, robust, and adaptable to various network configurations, making it a valuable tool for the design and analysis of industrial manifold systems involving viscoplastic fluids.</description>
